FT  03 SEP 93 / Price war takes toll on Nabisco

RJR NABISCO, the maker of Winston and Camel cigarettes, yesterday forecast
that 1993 operating income from US tobacco operations was likely to be 43
per cent lower than last year because of the price war launched last April
by rival Philip Morris.
The company, which also makes foods, warned of depressed results for the
rest of the year, but expected improved full-year results in 1994 because of
an aggressive margin improvement programme in all its operations
The US cigarette industry has been in turmoil since Philip Morris slashed
the price of Marlboro, the top selling brand in the US, by 20 per cent to
combat a decline in market share. Other manufacturers, including RJR, were
forced to follow suit.
RJR said operating income of its US tobacco unit, before amortisation of
trademarks and goodwill, could be Dollars 900m (Pounds 596m) lower in 1993
than last year's Dollars 2.11bn. This is the first time RJR has put a firm
figure on the cost of the price war.
RJR attributed the drop in income to the general fall in tobacco sales
revenues and one-time costs involved in the price reductions.
The company said another factor behind the lower 1993 results would be a
rise in short-term interest expense. This was because it had temporarily
used the proceeds from recent senior debt offerings to reduce lower-cost
bank debt, though it eventually planned to use the proceeds to pay off
higher cost debt.
Mr Charles Harper, RJR's new chairman, said that despite the changes in the
US tobacco market, the company would generate 'good cash flows that will
enable us to continue investing in business building activities, including
acquisitions'.
Several Wall Street analysts lowered their 1993 and 1994 earnings forecasts
for RJR following the announcement, by 5 to 10 cents a share in each year,
to between 33 and 41 cents this year and 40 and 53 cents in 1994.
Two credit information agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch
Investors Service, affirmed their ratings on the group's debt.
