FT  21 APR 94 / Cartel office blocks gas deal


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


Germany's Federal Cartel Office said yesterday a contract by Thyssengas and
Ruhrgas, the country's largest gas supplier and distributor respectively, to
supply energy to four cities in Germany would be forbidden under European
monopoly regulations. The companies can appeal to the Berlin Courts. The two
had intended to organise the distribution of gas to the cities of Cologne,
Duisberg, Dusseldorf and Oberhausen, a move which, according to the
decision, would have created a monopoly in the region.
The decision coincides with efforts by the economics ministry to prise open
gradually Germany's highly regulated energy sector and open up the industry
to domestic and international competition. It also coincides with growing
pressure by emerging participants in the German market, notably Wintershall,
the gas subsidiary of BASF, the country's largest chemical group, which is
seeking a larger niche in the energy sector.
