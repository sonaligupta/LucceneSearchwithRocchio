SHARE prices closed marginally higher after fluctuating in a narrow range on
arbitrage buying and profit-taking by institutional investors, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 29.90 at 20,983.20 after a day's high of 21,045.90
and low of 20,921.29. Foreign investors, individuals and dealers supported
the index against profit-taking by investment trusts and life insurers.
Volume was 350m shares, against 365m, remaining above 300m shares for the
third consecutive day. Advances led declines by 540 to 470, with 173 issues
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 4.57 up at
1,693.09, a new high for this year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
1.56 firmer at 1,298.22.
Hopes of an imminent cut in the official discount rate continued to support
sentiment, in spite of comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the
Bank of Japan, ruling out an early rate reduction. Many investors expect the
Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy next week, when the tankan, its
quarterly report on business sentiment, is due to be released.
Retail shares gained ground on reports that Mr Isao Nakauchi, chairman of
the supermarket chain Daiei, had presented Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime
minister, with a report on the deregulation of the retail sector. Daiei rose
Y110 to Y1,340, while Ito-Yokado gained Y210 at Y5,040 and Seiyu Y50 at
Y1,470.
The fall in the yen supported some consumer electronics makers. Matsushita
Electric Industrial moved ahead Y50 to Y1,480, TDK Y80 to Y3,990 and Victor
Y30 to Y1,050.
Yamaichi Securities lost Y10 to Y843 on rumours of undisclosed tobashi
deals, where brokers shift clients' accounts to hide unrealised profits.
Nomura Securities shed Y30 to Y2,170 but Daiwa Securities rose Y10 to
Y1,480.
In Osaka, the OSE average added 79.91 at 22,959.99 in volume of 80.3m
shares. Roundup
ANOTHER clutch of record highs enlivened trading in the region yesterday.

Foreign investors were active buyers of 'B' shares in Manila Electric, up 5
pesos at 241 pesos, and San Miguel, 10 higher at 143 pesos.

adding 9.09 at 2,021.87, for its second consecutive record high.

of Won284bn.
