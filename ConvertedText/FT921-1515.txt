FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wardell Roberts predicts setback


Directors of Wardell Roberts, the Dublin-based food products company, said
yesterday that they expected profits for the current year to be in the
region of IPounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.24m).
They pointed out that that was less than market expectations and said the
downturn from the previous year's IPounds 2.86m reflected difficult
conditions in both the UK and Irish markets.
The company was also withdrawing from the UK poultry market. Provisions of
some IPounds 2.6m connected with the withdrawal would be taken below the
line in the full year results.
