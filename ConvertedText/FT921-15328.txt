FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: Typo


City analysts tired of lambasting the management of their sector companies
should perhaps beware of trying to do better at the head of their own
business.
Take the example of Douglas Hawkins, who left James Capel as a respected
electronics analyst in 1988 to run Office & Electronic Machines. At the time
fellow analysts thought he was taking on a tough assignment at the
loss-making company which had been beset by managerial chaos and lumbered
with outdated equipment distribution contracts. Now 40-year-old Hawkins has
resigned as executive chairman and chief executive, although remaining
non-executive chairman.
While Hawkins did not return Observer's calls, the share price - which when
he joined rose 38p to 143p and is presently languishing at 41p - tells most
of the story.
