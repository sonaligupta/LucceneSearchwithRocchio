New Zealand-based forestry and resources concern Fletcher Challenge said
that its Canadian subsidiary, Timberwest Forest, recorded an operating
profit after tax of NZDollars 22.8m (USDollars 12.9m) for the period from
December 16 1993 to March 31 1994, AP-DJ reports from Wellington.
The result is the first issued by the concern since it acquired forest,
logging and milling operations from Fletcher Challenge Canada in December.
Timberwest's chief executive, Mr Keith Purchase, said the company was on
track to meet a forecast operating profit after tax of NZDollars 40.4m for
the six and a half months to June 30.
