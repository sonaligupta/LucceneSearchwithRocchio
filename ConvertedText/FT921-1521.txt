FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: P-E Intl tumbles to Pounds 1.62m


P-E INTERNATIONAL, the management and computer consultancy, reported a fall
in profits from Pounds 4.21m to Pounds 1.62m pre-tax for 1991.
Mr Hugh Lang, the outgoing chairman, blamed market conditions which he said
had deteriorated further in the second half.
A sharp fall in consultancy fees in the past two quarters from Pounds 32.7m
in 1990 to Pounds 29.5m had been the main reason for the profits decline.
Further cuts in the cost base resulted in staff levels being reduced by some
15 per cent. Redundancy costs of Pounds 541,000 were taken above the line.
Group turnover for the 12 months improved to Pounds 68.8m (Pounds 65m) and
included Pounds 5.5m from Handley-Walker, one of last year's three
acquisitions.
Overseas sales rose 14 per cent to Pounds 13.1m - the main markets being
Benelux, Germany, the US and Hong Kong.
Earnings fell to 4.9p (15p) but a maintained final dividend of 4.2p makes a
same-again 6.2p total. Net borrowings of Pounds 3m boosted gearing from 6
per cent to 22 per cent.
Mr Lang is being succeeded by Mr George Cox following the May annual
meeting.
