FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo union leader urges meeting
delay


   By HUGH CARNEGY

A SENIOR Swedish trade union leader yesterday called on Volvo to postpone
next week's vote by shareholders on the proposed merger of its car and truck
operations with France's Renault. Mr Peter Nygards, head of the white-collar
union SIF, says more time is needed to assess the deal.
The SIF has more than 5,000 members employed at Volvo. Mr Nygards was the
first national trade union leader to publicly voice doubts about the merger,
which has run into stiff resistance from the Swedish institutional
shareholders who will decide the issue at a special shareholders meeting
called for November 9.
'(Postponement) is the only reasonable way, as there are today too many
large uncertainties about how the merger will function in practice,' Mr
Nygards said.
Union support has been extremely important to Volvo because many top labour
figures sit on the boards of shareholder institutions.
The SIF leader is a member of the board of the Fourth Fund state pension
fund, which is the second-largest Volvo shareholder after Renault, with 7.5
per cent of the voting capital. The Fourth Fund is due to announce tomorrow
how it will vote on the Renault-Volvo merger. Its decision is widely
reckoned to be a key indicator of whether the deal will stand or fall.
Mr Nygards is also on the board of the insurance group SPP, which has 4.5
per cent of Volvo's voting capital and is also due to announce its final
decision this week.
Volvo was under strong pressure from shareholders yesterday to provide
further clarification of how it will secure its interests in the merged
company.
Volvo will have a 35 per cent share. However, Swedish shareholders are
concerned by a lack of guarantees that state-owned Renault will be
privatised as promised.
