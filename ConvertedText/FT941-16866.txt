FT  07 JAN 94 / Observer: Nominally


Never mind 1994. What Observer is looking forward to is chewing the fat with
the cream of humanity at the World Forum to be staged by the London School
of Economics on July 17-21 1995. The topic? 'Will human societies ever again
be governable?'
Speakers scheduled for the opening sessions include Mikhail Gorbachev,
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, according to the preliminary programme.
Others awarded slots during the following days include George Soros, Karl
Otto Pohl, Rupert Murdoch, the 'head of the KGB', and the Dalai Lama.
There is only one snag. None of the listed eminences has yet signed up to
attend, the programme admits. Their names are printed just to give an idea
of the event's intended scale.
For sheer cheek it deserves to succeed.
