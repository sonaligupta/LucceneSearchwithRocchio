FT  17 JAN 92 / Big cash boost for Italian state groups


   By ROBERT GRAHAM

THE ITALIAN government yesterday approved L10,000bn (Pounds 4.6bn) in
much-needed funds for IRI, the state holding company, and Efim, the state
industrial holding.
The money will be made available under a complex formula intended to
circumvent a supreme court block on the funds, and to satisfy the European
Commission which has been scrutinising state aid to Italian industry.
IRI has debts exceeding L55,000bn and has had no significant fresh injection
of funds since 1989. Efim has debts of L7,000bn and has been nearly
bankrupted by supporting its loss-making aluminium activities.
Last February, the government agreed to cover up to 4 per cent annual
interest and guarantee loans and bonds on maturities of up to 12 years
totalling L10,000bn for the two organisations. This was blocked by the
public audit office, an action subsequently supported by the supreme court
which ruled that, since government financial planning was on a three-year
programme, it was unconstitutional to create obligations for future
administrations beyond this period.
The new formula envisages three cash injections of L400bn, L400bn and
L1,200bn covering 1991-1993, plus a guarantee to cover up to 4 per cent of
interest on credits and bonds during this period. According to an IRI
spokesman this will be regarded as the equivalent of the state, as
shareholder, injecting fresh funds - even though IRI remains in the
anomalous position of being a holding with no formal capital merely an
endowment fund.
On the basis of these cash injections, IRI would be able to raise up to
L8,450bn between 1991 and 1993; Efim would be able to borrow up to L1,550bn.
IRI plans to invest some L70,000bn in its various holdings over the next
four years, and maintains that it has only received L2,58bn in direct state
aid since 1986. These funds are needed to develop advanced sectors such as
telecommunications. However, substantial investment is also needed to
restructure traditional industries like steel (due to absorb L3,000bn),
ship-building and defence, in addition to heavy continuing commitments such
as that to RAI, the state-run television.
At the same time IRI is gearing up to meet the government's demands to raise
L15,000bn this year from privatisation. Privatisation measures, including
the right for the private sector to own majority stakes in state companies,
are a key element of revenue raising in the 1992 budget. However, political
disagreements are still holding up final approval of the form privatisation
will take.
