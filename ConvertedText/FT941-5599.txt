FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Data ahead 10% at Pounds 1.75m


Pre-tax profits of British Data Management, the specialist data management
and storage group, showed a near-10 per cent improvement from Pounds 1.6m to
Pounds 1.75m in the six months to end-December.
Turnover increased to Pounds 8.18m (Pounds 7.04m), reflecting a full
contribution from the three commercial data management businesses acquired
last year.
At the operating level profits rose to Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.65m),
principally because of the replacement of rental charges with
correspondingly higher interest costs from the acquisition of property
previously held on leasehold terms. The interest cost on the acquisition
loans amounted to Pounds 210,000, pushing the total charge up from Pounds
53,000 to Pounds 311,000.
Earnings per share were 5.7p (6.3p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.65p
(1.5p).
