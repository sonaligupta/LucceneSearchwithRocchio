FT  16 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bear raid on Lonrho


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON


THE PRICE of Lonrho fell very sharply in midsession yesterday as a number of
adverse stories circulated in the market. The shares closed 20 down at 143p
with 8m traded.
UK investment bank SG Warburg has been selling the shares steadily for some
time and continued to do so yesterday. There were lines of 1m and 1.4m
shares traded around 160p. Traders said the shares had also been hit by bear
raids. Lonrho is in its closed period ahead of the announcement of full-year
results on January 23, and therefore not permitted to comment on its
financial position. There is also a large number of shares believed to be
seeking buyers in a market where no-one appears willing to pick them up.
Speculation that Warburg had lowered its profits forecast for Lonrho was,
however, strongly denied. On Monday, County NatWest cut its dividend
prediction to 12p from 16p. The shares have further been affected recently
by 'the tycoon factor', the belief that a company run by one dominant
individual is vulnerable to unexpected developments.
Negative press comment following the resignation of executive director Mr
Terry Robinson has also upset Lonrho, which has been buffeted by very low
metal prices, still bumping along the bottom yesterday.
C and W doubts
Cable and Wireless continued to respond to stories of an imminent deal with
AT&T, of the US, but closed well below the day's best after intermittent
bouts of profit-taking during another active trading session.
The shares were hoisted to an all-time peak of 632p at the outset of
trading, but quickly ran into a squall of selling, mostly inspired by BZW,
before stabilising and then moving up again to close a net 7 higher at 625p.
Turnover was a hefty 4.6m shares.
BZW responded to the strength in the C and W share price by removing the
stock from its buy list. The investment bank said a bid from AT&T was
'possible but unlikely', listing many practical and financial obstacles to a
full bid. Prominent objections included AT&T's 70 per cent gearing, earnings
dilution, the rarity of hostile US bids in the UK, and the 'golden share' in
C and W and C and W's overseas licences, which would require bid approval
from the relevant authorities. The broker did, however, point out the
credibility of AT&T taking a substantial stake in Mercury.
Gas busy
News that British Gas had avoided a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission (MMC) by agreeing to the proposals put forward by the Office of
Fair Trading triggered a flurry of activity in British Gas shares.
The stock, depressed over recent sessions by the prospect of an MMC
referral, raced up from an initially easier 239p to 254p as the news
emerged, before slipping back and ending a busy session 3 better on the day
at 245p. Turnover in the stock reached a well-above-average 14m.
Specialists have long expressed concern at the prospect of an MMC referral,
which some said could have led to an enforced dismemberment of the company.
While some analysts said they would have preferred British Gas to have faced
up to the rigours of a full MMC inquiry - 'they are already staring at a new
pricing formula of RPI minus 5, increasing competition and a tough 1992
trading year', said one - others were relieved at the news.
Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, long-term bulls of British Gas, said
the news was 'highly positive' for the shares. 'The progressive dividend
policy is now likely to be maintained,' added Mr Toalster. Smith New Court
also adopted a bullish view of the latest manoeuvring. Mr Steve Turner at
Smith said: 'It was always unlikely that the MMC could have offered a better
deal than the OFT; it was not a pleasant choice but really Gas had no
alternative.'
Hanson active
Acquisitive conglomerate Hanson saw very heavy turnover for the second day
running, with the shares adding 8 1/2 at 212 1/2 p by the close, one of its
biggest price moves for many months. Turnover of 16m shares was the highest
since Hanson launched its bid for Beazer in September, and the heaviest
among FT-SE 100 stocks yesterday.
Analysts said the shares were continuing to receive a strong push from the
dollar's advance as half of Hanson's turnover is achieved in the US. There
was also support from a news wire story, following a company meeting with
analysts, that Hanson is more likely to buy into continental Europe now that
rules governing hostile bids are clearer.
Fall in Guinness
Guinness was one of the weak spots in the Footsie, the shares losing 11 in a
strong market to close at 533p with 4.9m traded.
Although most analysts in the sector have the stock on their buy lists a
spate of selling was prompted by a rumour, largely discounted, that the
spirits giant was considering a bid for Pernod Ricard.
Some analysts have been adjusting profit forecasts to reflect poor general
trading conditions. Strauss Turnbull cut its 1991 estimate by Pounds 5m to
Pounds 960m and 1992's by Pounds 10m to Pounds 1.115bn but said it remained
a buyer. Strauss's figures are still around the top of the range of
analysts' estimates.
SmithKline Beecham rose sharply after its Belgian unit said it had developed
the first vaccine against Hepatitis-A, a viral disease that affects the
liver. The unit said the vaccine has still to be commercialised but hoped it
could go on sale later this year. The shares showed a gain of 33 at midday
but eased to close 18 up at 963p on turnover of 3.2m. Glaxo was volatile,
moving up 15 in early trading before slipping back on profit-taking. The
shares closed 9 down at 916p with 6.5m traded. Broker recommendations were
said to have been behind a flurry of buying in the bank stocks. NatWest
raced up 12 to 276p on heavy turnover of 5.3m, with Kleinwort Benson and
County NatWest said to have given the stock a push.
Utility shares gave a ready response to the whiff of a Conservative victory
in this year's general election. Water shares in particular, the regional
electricity stocks and the power generators all came in for strong support
after a national newspaper opinion poll indicated that the Tories had
overtaken Labour.
Water issues have come under periodic bouts of downward pressure after a
series of opinion polls showed Labour ahead of the Conservatives. The Labour
party has consistently said it would renationalise the water companies.
Labour also recently criticised the level of profitability of the
electricity companies.
An early gain in Rolls-Royce was curtailed after UBS Phillips & Drew weighed
in with a harsh profits downgrading and took the stock off its buy list.
The broker now forecasts 1992 profits of Pounds 110m against its previous
estimate of Pounds 150m. Explaining the cut Mr Paul Compton said there would
be 'more redundancies in 1992 and a delay in spare parts recovery'. Having
risen 5 initially, the stock ended a penny down on the day at 138p; turnover
swelled to 11m shares.
Associated British Ports closed 4 down at 319p after the company warned that
profits for 1991 will be around half of 1990's Pounds 60m because of falling
property values.
Forte receded 7 to 230p, depressed by hints of profits downgradings. UBS
Phillips & Drew, Forte's broker, emphatically denied market stories that it
had lowered its estimates for Forte.
