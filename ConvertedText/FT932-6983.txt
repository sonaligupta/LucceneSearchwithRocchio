FT  26 MAY 93 / Observer: Changing places


What are we to make of the last minute change of seating plan on this week's
edition of BBC Question Time? Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader of the
Labour party, has promised to turn up along with Baroness Shirley Williams,
co-founder of the SDP, and GEC director Sara Morrison. But Chancellor of the
Exchequer Norman Lamont has suddenly found he's unable to attend and been
replaced by Home Secretary Kenneth Clarke. Shape of things to come, perhaps?
