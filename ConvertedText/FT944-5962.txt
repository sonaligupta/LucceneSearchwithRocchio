FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Technology scheme effort paid dividends


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Mr Michael Zarraga, headmaster of St Thomas More Roman Catholic
Comprehensive in Blaydon, Tyne and Wear, by his own admission is not a
'brownie points man'.
'I don't go into any initiative for the sake of being a good boy,' he says.
But when the government launched the technology college initiative, Mr
Zarraga jumped at the opportunity to gain more resources and added impetus
for the objectives he already had for his school.
Raising Pounds 100,000, mostly in the form of equipment, from industry was
time-consuming but worthwhile, he says. Together with the government's
matching Pounds 100,000 capital grant and its annual maintenance grant of
Pounds 100 per pupil for three years, the school will benefit from a total
injection in cash and kind of more than Pounds 500,000 - a substantial
increase in the sums it has discretion in spending.
But Mr Zarraga says its commitment to a broad curriculum will remain. 'We
wouldn't say that we are specialising in maths, science and technology; our
ambition is to be excellent in maths, science and technology as well as
English, foreign languages, music and the arts.'
A 1,150-pupil comprehensive founded in the 1960s as a secondary modern, St
Thomas More has a stronger than average academic performance in spite of its
mixed catchment area, including inner city parts of Gateshead.
Mr Zarraga does not believe the technology college concept is unfair to
schools not participating. 'If you can't give it to everybody you give it to
those which have demonstrated they have the resources to use it correctly
and develop courses and ideas for other people.'
The biggest private sector sponsor was Komatsu UK, the locally based
Japanese-owned earthmoving equipment manufacturer. It gave Pounds 28,650 of
computer controlled robotic equipment and learning kits.
