FT  14 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses await a signal from
the Bundesbank


   By Our Markets Staff


There was a suggestion, as bourses sagged yesterday, that they were waiting
for the Bundesbank to cut the German Lombard rate today, writes Our Markets
Staff.
A Lombard cut would mean little, since it represents an interest rate
ceiling at a time when rates are coming down, but traders said that they
were looking for a 'sign'. The Bundesbank, meanwhile, had cut repo rates by
another three basis points.
FRANKFURT's banks and financials had already discounted the interest rate
scenario, and only Deutsche Bank posted a reasonable rise, DM4 on the
session and another DM2 to DM797.50 in the post-bourse after Tuesday's
DM17.50 loss on the Jurgen Schneider property loans scare.
The Dax index eased 1.31 to 2,209.19 as turnover fell from DM9.5bn to
DM8.3bn.
Special situations and smaller cyclicals saw share price action, PWA putting
on another DM3.50 to DM233 on this week's Swedish pulp price rises and
Kugelfisher, the recovery hope in ball bearings, rising another DM13 to
DM271.
Klockner-Werke combined both characteristics. Tipped by Mr Werner Friedman
at Bank Julius Bar at DM129.50 at the end of February, and by Mr Hans-Peter
Wodniok of Flemings at DM142 early this week, it closed DM8.20 up at DM157.
Traditionally viewed as a steelmaker, K-W withdrew from the sector this
year, and Mr Friedman said that it was undervalued; Mr Wodniok had it on a
p/e of 9.5 (now about 10) for the engineering sector's peak year, against
the sector average of 18.4.
PARIS set its sights firmly on the Buba meeting today and decided to mark
time in the interim. The CAC-40 index gained 3.81 to 2,152.36.
Michelin was the day's most important news, the tyre group reporting 1993
results well in line with analysts' expectations. The shares slipped FFr3.50
to FFr269.50 as some investors decided it was time to take profits after
good performance earlier this week.
Peugeot rose FFr11 to FFr916, for a 5 per cent rise on the week to date,
while UAP slipped a further FFr4.30 to FFr166.00.
MILAN saw a wave of profit-taking in a shortened day's trading as the
telematic electronic trading system again struggled to cope with the
workload. The Comit index fell 11.86 or 1.5 per cent to 788.76.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan said that selling pressure came
as little surprise at the end of a monthly account which had seen a 15.5 per
cent rise in the two weeks since the general election.
He noted that the day's biggest losers were issues that had seen the most
impressive gains in recent sessions and said that there could be further
selling pressure today. Yesterday's end of April's trading account was
extended by 24 hours to give the market more time to help clear its backlog.
Among recent strong performers, Fiat fell L397 or 5.9 per cent to L6,303,
Pirelli lost L165 or 5.1 per cent to L3,095 and Stet gave up L364 or 4.4 per
cent to L5,971.
One of the few shares to climb was Ferruzzi, up L58 or 2.6 per cent at
L2,308: on Monday the company said it was launching a complex L1,339bn
rights issue.
ZURICH extended morning losses, the SMI index falling 10.1 to 2,877.7. UBS
bearers fell SFr16 to SFr1,249 after reports that around Dollars 150m held
in accounts had been confiscated in connection with an investigation into
the laundering of drug money. One analyst commented that the fall in the
share price seemed 'ridiculous', adding that investors appeared to be
muddling the bank's own money with that of its customers.
A weak trend in the other banks and insurers was attributed to London based
selling: Zurich Insurance bearers were SFr24 down at SFr1,296.
Against the trend, Brown Boveri bearers put on SFr22 to SFr1,260, with one
portfolio management bank seen as a big buyer.
Schindler, the elevator and rolling stock manufacturer, rose another SFr35
to SFr1,695 in continued response to Tuesday's profits outlook.
AMSTERDAM moved little either side of opening values and the AEX index
finished just in positive territory, advancing 0.14 to 424.08.
Unilever showed a larger swing than most on the downside, losing Fl 1.30 to
Fl 205.20. This was partly on news that its rival, Procter & Gamble, was to
sue a Unilever subsidiary over a domestic television commercial which it
alleged was misleading.
Heineken closed flat at Fl 206, after moving between a session high of Fl
206.50 and a low of Fl 205.70, after reporting that European beer conditions
remained under pressure. In the same sector Grolsch added 40 cents to Fl
51.90.
MADRID's heavyweight banking sector, relatively weak over the last month,
quarter and twelve months, continued to depress the general market after
pressure on bond prices.
The general index fell 3.39, or just over 1 per cent to 325.29. Among the
banks, BBV dropped Pta70, or more than 2 per cent to Pta3,200 and Popular,
similarly, by Pta350 to Pta15,100. The most active stock was Telefonica,
down another Pta30 to Pta1,765.
