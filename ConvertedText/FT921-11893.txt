FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ANS makes Pounds 0.71m and seeks funds


ASSOCIATED Nursing Services reported a substantial half-year profit and
directors are looking for a return to sustained growth and want to
strengthen the balance sheet.
Therefore, they proposed a placing and open offer of 5.48m shares to raise
Pounds 6.27m to reduce borrowings and for working capital. The placing will
be with institutions and shareholders can clawback on a 1-for-1 basis at
120p per share.
The shares rose 42p to 148p.
Mr Robert Upsdell, chairman, said following the problems of the 1990-91
year, when a loss of Pounds 2.07m was incurred, the 28 weeks to October 12
1991 showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 705,000, compared with Pounds 421,000.
Earnings per share rose to 12.9p (7.7p) but there is no interim dividend,
compared with 1p and no final last time.
Borrowings were being reduced and were anticipated to fall further in the
coming months following asset sales. Expenditure was planned to increase the
capacity of two homes and the option will be taken by March 2 to buy
Gazedown, which runs the Greengables Nursing Home, for Pounds 690,000 and
assume its debt.
With the placing, 547,765 warrants will be issued on a 1-for-10 basis
entitling shareholders to subscribe for shares at 175p each any time prior
to September 30 1993.
