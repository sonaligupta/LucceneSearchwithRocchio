FT  09 JUN 92 / Panama protesters await Bush's visit


   By REUTER


   PANAMA CITY


PANAMANIANS ranging from jobless slum dwellers to wealthy businessmen plan
to make their grievances known to US president George Bush when he visits
this week for the first time since he ordered an invasion of their country,
Reuter reports from Panama City.
All of them accuse the White House of doing too little to resolve lingering
problems caused by the December 1989 military strike that toppled strongman
General Manuel Noriega and killed at least 520 Panamanians.
'There are a lot of people in Panama who feel that the US should continue
giving to this country, that the aid hasn't been sufficient,' said a senior
Latin American diplomat.
'They'll take advantage of Bush's visit to ask for more.'
Mr Bush is scheduled to pass through the country on Thursday on his way to
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. He plans to meet Panamanian President
Guillermo Endara, sworn in at a US military base on the eve of the invasion,
and speak at a downtown plaza.
On the surface, Panama's post-invasion recovery looks sound. The economy,
buoyed in part by millions of dollars in cash, credits and loan guarantees
from the US, grew at an impressive 9.3 per cent rate last year. Deposits in
Panama's offshore banking sector rose from Dollars 11.5bn to Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 9.3bn) from December 1989 to December 1991.
But Panama's prosperity over the past 2 1/2 years has failed to reach a
sizeable portion of the population.
Unemployment in the Atlantic port city of Colon has climbed to 50 per cent
by some estimates. Residents there have rioted twice this year to demand
more help from the government.
In Panama City, where drug abuse has soared since the invasion, police are
battling a crime wave that appears unlikely to go away soon.
And the country's image is tainted by incessant reports that money
laundering has fuelled its booming construction and banking industries.
