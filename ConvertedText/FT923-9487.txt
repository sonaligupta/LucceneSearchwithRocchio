FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Condomania


At long last, conclusive (well, almost) evidence that advertising works.
The UK government's national television and press advertising campaigns to
persuade people of the dangers of the HIV virus and Aids and the virtues of
using condoms is one of the key factors behind the doubling of condom sales
since 1987, according to research carried out by Mintel International.
This year some 155m condoms, with a retail value of Pounds 43m, are likely
to be sold in the UK, with the market set to grow substantially in the next
few years.
Mintel suggests that the 'embarrassment factor' is also fast disappearing;
evidence is that mail order sales have declined from 3 to 2 per cent of
total sales.
