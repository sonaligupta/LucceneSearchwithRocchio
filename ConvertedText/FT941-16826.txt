FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Pelican expands to Pounds 0.96m and expects
further growth


   By CATHERINE MILTON


Pelican Group, the restaurant operator, reported pre-tax profits ahead from
Pounds 357,000 to Pounds 960,000 in the six months to September 30.
Turnover rose to Pounds 6.67m (Pounds 3.83m). The company opened four
restaurants during the period taking the total to 28.
However, the results included only five month contributions from both the
Yankee Noodle Restaurants, acquired in May for Pounds 6m and from Cafe
Pelican, the refurbished central London outlet, which contributed more than
a tenth of operating profits.
'We are now in a position to continue our strategy of creating multiple
restaurant chains. We now have many concepts available for expansion
throughout the UK and a strong management structure in place in the US,'
said Mr Roger Myers, chairman.
He said the company's rapid expansion in recent years had yielded bulk
buying benefits. 'The real growth comes from opening more restaurants and
from the Yankee Noodle acquisition.'
Mr Robert Earl, who is behind the Planet Hollywood chain of themed burger
restaurants, has become an executive director of Pelican's US subsidiary. He
joined Pelican as a non-executive in May with the Yankee Noodle acquisition.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 538,000) and interest charges
fell to Pounds 66,000 (Pounds 181,000). Total debt at the half-way stage
stood at Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 3m) giving gearing of 10 per cent. Mr Myers
said gearing should not exceed current levels.
The company has no need to raise funds for organic growth from shareholders
following last year's Pounds 6m placing and open offer which paid for the
Yankee Noodle acquisition.
Mr Myers said all the restaurants were now generating cash and were
profitable. Cash flow from operating activities in the period was more than
Pounds 1m (Pounds 450,000).
Earnings per share rose to 1.95p (1.89p) after a tax charge this time of
Pounds 200,000.
For the second successive year, the board has decided not to pay an interim
dividend so as to 'maximise the funds available to fuel expansion', Mr Myers
said.
