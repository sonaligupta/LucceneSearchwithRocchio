FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


THE chief executive's resignation at Glaxo along with continued nervous
trading ahead of next week's Budget unsettled the futures, leaving it to
trade in a narrow range, writes Joel Kibazo.
The early buying of the March contract on the FT-SE, which saw it move 7
ahead to 2,967 shortly after the market's opening, was led by independent
traders. However, consideration of the announcement from Glaxo caused a
turnaround in the fortunes of the contract and by 9.30am it had fallen to
2,942.
A period of sideways trading then followed which saw the contract trading
between 2,947 and 2,960 for the rest of the day with some buying over the
lunchtime period being the reason for the rise to the 2,960 level.
The weakness in gilts and the German markets was also cited as a reason for
the dull trading, while in the afternoon Wall Street had no impact. March
finished at 2,950, 8 below its previous close and at a discount to the
underlying cash market. Turnover was unimpressive at 8,373 lots.
Volume in the traded options was high, with a significant contribution
coming from BTR. The day's total came to 48,414 lots with 8,270 contracts
dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.
The Euro FT-SE 100 contract was particularly busy with 9,160 lots recorded.
In the stock options, BTR saw hefty business of 9,843 lots.
