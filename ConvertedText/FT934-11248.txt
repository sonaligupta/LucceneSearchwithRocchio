FT  02 NOV 93 / Subcontractors' lobby formed


AN UMBRELLA organisation has been established to represent the interests of
specialist construction subcontractors, which perform the largest value of
work done by builders.
The Constructors' Liaison Group will bring together trade organisations
acting on behalf of plumbers, electricians, structural steel contractors and
plasterers.
The move will meet demands from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, who wants access to ministers and civil servants to be restricted
to a smaller number of better resourced and more powerful trade
organisations in each industrial sector.
The liaison group said that although specialist sub-contractors were often
small businesses, together they accounted for more than 44 per cent of all
staff and operatives in the construction industry.
The group wants to increase sub-contractors' representation on the Joint
Contracts Tribunal, responsible for developing standard forms and conditions
for the construction industry.
It will also seek improved arrangements with main contractors and clients to
ensure that subcontractors and their suppliers are paid on time.
