FT  19 MAY 92 / BOC gases plant to serve Sheffield


BOC GROUP is to invest Pounds 45m in a new industrial gases production and

industry in the Sheffield area.
The plant, at Brinsworth, Rotherham, involves the biggest investment of its
type for BOC in the UK and coincides with the winning of a 15-year contract
to supply oxygen by pipeline to three works operated in the region by United
