FT  15 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Liffe narrows gap with CME in
futures rankings

   CHICAGO


Adjusted volume figures released by the Futures Industry Association, the US
industry group, show London's Liffe is in a tight race for second place in
the rankings of the world's futures exchanges.
Liffe has run a healthy third in recent years behind the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, and its rate of growth consistently
exceeds that of the two Chicago bodies.
However, second-placed CME muddied the volume rankings this year by revising
its counting method, adding options exercises and expirations, mutual offset
trades and other off-floor activities that its competitors say inflate
volume.
In response to an industry outcry, the FIA has begun releasing adjusted data
for the CME, using the exchange's old method of counting turnover.
The FIA reports CME first-quarter volume at 50.2m contracts, as opposed to
the CME's own counting of 54.7m. For March, the FIA data puts the CME at
19.5m contracts, compared with the exchange's report of 22.1m.
By comparison, Liffe's first-quarter turnover was 47.5m contracts, and for
March it was 17.0m. Liffe's volume was up 115 per cent from the first
quarter of 1993, while the CME's gained about 35 per cent.
The CBoT remains firmly in first place with first-quarter volume of 58m
contracts.
