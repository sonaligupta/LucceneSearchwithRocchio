FT  19 MAY 92 / Stand and deliver call from mail union


   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff


A LAW designed to punish highwaymen for holding up stagecoaches and stealing
the Royal Mail is being used today to dismiss postal workers who fail to
deliver letters on time, according to the Union of Communication Workers,
the main postal union.
'Wilful delay of the post' has been a criminal offence since the 1640s but
Post Office supervisors have only recently started invoking the ancient law
as part of an efficiency drive, the UCW says.
One postman in Dumfries, Scotland, for example, failed to note on the front
of a letter that it could not be delivered because of dogs loose in a front
garden. The UCW says that it was raining hard at the time, which made it
particularly difficult for the postman to get out his pencil.
The letter went back into the system and the postman was suspended from duty
for wilful delay. He was later reinstated and given a written reprimand.
The union says the case is just one of many and claims some supervisors are
using the law to victimise individuals. Its conference in Bournemouth will
today call on Royal Mail, the letters arm of the Post Office, to introduce
separate disciplinary offences of 'malicious delay' and plain 'delay'.
It wants the criminal offence of 'wilful delay' to be reserved for clear
cases of theft.
Royal Mail said yesterday that the rules and disciplinary procedures were
clearly laid out. Best efforts were always made to ensure they were applied
in a fair way. If a postman was taken ill, for example, and 'staggered back
obviously ill', that would not be regarded as wilful delay.
