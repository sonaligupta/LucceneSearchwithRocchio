FT  11 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


IT was a heavy trading session in stock index futures yesterday, in part
because marketmakers read the trend incorrectly at the opening.
The overnight strength of the dollar, together with an initial spurt of
demand for Allied-Lyons, induced a mark-up in the March contract on the
Footsie, which showed a premium of 54 points before trading had properly
started. Speculative buying pushed the premium to 65 points, against a fair
value premium, allowing for dividend and financing costs, of only 29 points
or so.
Then, as the Allied situation calmed down and share investors took profits
ahead of the close of the equity account, locals in the stock index futures
sector sold March heavily, bringing in the premium to 35-40 points by the
official close; later trading saw March under further pressure.
Traded options were relatively quiet, with total turnover of 24,779 compared
with 32,857. Allied-Lyons topped the active list, with 4,389 lots dealt, as
hints circulated of an impending bid from the US. Option trading was
inhibited by refusal of several leading firms to register as marketmakers in
individual stock options when the market moves to new premises at the
beginning of February.
