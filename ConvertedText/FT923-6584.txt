FT  24 AUG 92 / Kuwait plans to spend Dollars 12bn on building up armed
forces


   By REUTER


   KUWAIT


KUWAIT has allocated an extra KD3.5bn (Dollars 12bn) to spend on buying
advanced weapons and building up its armed forces over the next 12 years,
Reuter reports from Kuwait.
A decree from the Emir, issued late on Saturday, said the government was
authorised to draw the KD3.5bn from its general reserves and add it to money
already allocated to bolster Kuwait's defences.
'The Higher Defence Council is authorised to allocate the sums needed for
every financial year for 12 years beginning from the financial year
1992/1993,' the decree said.
'Those sums which are not spent in every year will be transferred to the
subsequent year.'
It was not clear exactly what was meant by the amount already allocated for
Kuwait's defence. Economists said they believed money drawn from the KD3.5bn
would most likely not be included in budget projections, but would be added
to final accounts drawn up at the end of each fiscal year.
Kuwait raised defence spending in fiscal 1991/1992 five-fold from the
previous year but the increase was mainly due to huge contributions towards
the costs of allied forces which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation.
Kuwait has not announced a defence allocation for its current 1992-1993
budget, which foresees a drop in total spending to KD4bn from an estimated
KD6.2bn in 1991/1992.
But it has said non-recurring war costs would fall to KD2.21bn in 1992/1993
from KD4.5bn the previous year.
Diplomats say Kuwait's plans to overhaul its armed forces and buy hundreds
of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, helicopters, artillery and air
defence systems are still being worked out.
No exact breakdown is available, but economists say the emirate's general
reserves and overseas assets have dwindled to less than Dollars 40bn from
Dollars 100bn before Iraq's invasion because of heavy Gulf war spending.
