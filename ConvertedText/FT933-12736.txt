FT  22 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Walt Disney doubles size of
100-year offer


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday became the first borrower
in nearly 40 years to raise money through an issue of bonds in the US market
with a maturity of 100 years.
The size of the issue, redeemable July 15 2093, was doubled to Dollars 300m,
fuelled by a demand from US bond investors for higher returns in the face of
record-low Treasury bond yields.
The bonds were priced yesterday morning in New York to yield 95 basis points
over the benchmark 30 Treasury bond. They were estimated to offer investors
some 15-20 basis points above what they might have received had the company
issued 30-year bonds: a 40-year issue from McDonald's, the hamburger chain
(which like Disney is a weak double-A credit), was recently launched at a
yield spread of 75 basis points, and was yesterday trading at a spread of 80
basis points over the long Treasury bond.
The Treasury market rally has already brought a flurry of 50-year
transactions this year, from Texaco, Boeing and Ford among others. The last
100-year deal is thought to have been a 1954 issue by Chicago & Eastern
Illinois, a railway company, with a coupon of 5 per cent.
The Disney deal, which was offered at par with a coupon of 7.55 per cent, is
callable after 30 years. It has an average duration of roughly 13 years,
making it only slightly longer than a comparable 30-year bond, said Mr Mark
Seigel, head of corporate bond underwriting at Morgan Stanley.
Demand had shown that the yield pick-up was seen by investors as an adequate
compensation for this increase in duration, he said.
