FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Amber Day shows 29% improvement to Pounds
7.1m


   By MAGGIE URRY


AMBER DAY, the discount retail group, increased pre-tax profits by 29 per
cent to Pounds 7.1m in the half year to February 1, helped by a Pounds 1.1m
fall in the interest charge to Pounds 354,000 following last summer's Pounds
24.4m rights issue.
Earnings per share, however, rose a more modest 2.4 per cent to 3.81p. The
shares fell 3p to 80p.
In December the group, which bought the What Everyone Wants chain in June
1990, sold its two menswear chains, which it had acquired in 1988 and 1989.
The menswear side incurred trading losses in the half year of Pounds 591,000
(profit Pounds 454,000).
A Pounds 4.5m loss on the sale of that business was charged below the line,
as was a write-off of goodwill amounting to Pounds 8.1m which had previously
been written off against reserves. Consequently there was a retained loss of
Pounds 9.2m (profit Pounds 2.7m).
Group turnover was barely changed at Pounds 55.5m, though within that WEW
increased sales by 7.3 per cent to Pounds 47.7m. Operating profits from WEW
were up 18 per cent to Pounds 7.8m.
The interim dividend is raised from 0.9p to 1.1p.
In the 1991 year the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 10.1m,
earnings of 7.02p and a total dividend of 2.7p.
