FT  13 APR 94 / Observer: The blue room


And now, for the business executive who has everything except style: the IBM
bedroom. Who gets these ideas? More, who thinks they are worth a press
release? This one is dated April 12 so it's probably not an April Fool's
joke.
Apparently, IBM's UK personal computer outfit has 'teamed up with American
hotelier and restaurateur Bob Payton to create an IBM-themed bedroom at his
luxury country hotel, Stapleford Park, in Leicestershire'. Each of the
hotel's bedrooms has been decked out according to the whim of a
'quintessentially English' company; as of course is IBM.
It gets worse. 'In keeping with the innovative and youthful image of the IBM
PC company, the bedroom will cleverly incorporate a pictorial interpretation
of the IBM logo into the door . . .'
To incite you to rush straight out, presumably. Who says IBM has lost focus?
