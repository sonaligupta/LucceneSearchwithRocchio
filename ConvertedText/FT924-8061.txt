FT  13 NOV 92 / Reynolds warns on EC aid


   By REUTER


   BONN


Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds said yesterday that the European
Community could not open negotiations with prospective new members until
agreement is reached on additional aid for poorer EC countries, Reuter
reports from Bonn.
Speaking after talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, he said that
with Europe's highest unemployment rate, Ireland wanted agreement on
increasing the EC's so-called structural funds and creating a new cohesion
fund to help poorer members.
'Our position was that if they weren't dealt with we wouldn't be supporting
enlargement,' he told a news conference.
Mr Reynolds said that in order to get agreement at next month's EC summit in
Edinburgh on opening membership negotiations, there had to be agreement on
the so-called Delors II package on financial aid to poorer member states.
