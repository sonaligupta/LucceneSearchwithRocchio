FT  13 NOV 92 / New twist in EC saga on tobacco adverts


   By ANDREW HILL

EC countries which have a national ban on tobacco advertising could block
imports from other EC members of magazines and newspapers carrying such
advertisements, the European Commission said yesterday.
The warning came ahead of today's meeting of health ministers at which
Commission proposals for an EC-wide ban on tobacco advertising will be
discussed for the first time since May.
But a spokesman for Ms Vasso Papandreou, the EC health commissioner,
conceded yesterday that Britain, the Netherlands and Germany had not relaxed
their opposition to a ban since May. Together, the trio can block approval
of the Commission's proposal and no vote is expected today.
The draft directive, which covers advertising, except at point of sale, and
sponsorship, is partly intended to prevent national restrictions from
hampering the free movement of magazines and journals after January 1, 1993.
But advertising agencies, publishers, cigarette manufacturers and the three
member states dispute the value and legality of a ban. Denmark and Greece
also have reservations about the measure.
In a legal opinion for the German Associations of Newspaper and Magazine
Publishers, two senior European lawyers this week said the draft directive
proposing a ban was 'masquerading as a measure designed to ensure the
completion of the internal market' and represented 'a blatant invasion of
the Community into the public health sector (in relation to which the
Community has extremely limited jurisdiction if at all)'.
Yet cigarette manufacturers are still concerned if they relax their
vociferous campaign against the proposals, the opposition to a ban might
crumble.
