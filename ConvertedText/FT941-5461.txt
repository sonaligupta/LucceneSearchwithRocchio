FT  07 MAR 94 / Fears over Italian oil blow-out


   By JOHN SIMKINS


Italian environmentalists claimed at the weekend that the country's first
onshore oil well blow-out had caused an ecological disaster and wiped out at
least a year's rice production in the area, writes John Simkins.
Agip, the oil exploration company controlled by the state-owned Eni group,
has commissioned the Battelle Institute of Geneva to analyse the damage
caused by the spill last week at its Trecate-Villa Fortuna oilfield near
Novara, about 40km west of Milan, and advise on cleaning up. Trecate
provides half of Italy's annual crude oil production and 5 per cent of
consumption in a country heavily dependent on imports. Agip made the well
safe at the weekend.
Mr Roberto Gazzola, of the environmental group Legambiente, said: 'We
believe the damage is even more serious than it appears. It is possible the
oil has permeated the earth's water-bearing stratum and seeped into the
Ticino river.'
