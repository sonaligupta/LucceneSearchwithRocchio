FT  22 DEC 92 / SDP keeps hold on Montenegro


   By REUTER


   PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO


THE ruling Socialist Democratic party kept its hold on Montenegro,
unofficial results indicated yesterday, virtually guaranteeing its continued
alliance with Serbia in a rump Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Podgorica,
Montenegro.
The vote in the republic, the last official ally of Serbia, was considered a
referendum on the future of the Yugoslav federation. Election officials said
they had not finished counting votes and refused to give interim results.
But Radio Montenegro said that in the capital, Podgorica, which has a
quarter of the nation's 400,000 voters, the ruling DPS had taken 49 per cent
of votes for the republic's parliament and the opposition Liberal party 11
per cent.
