FT  30 JAN 92 / Australian inflation rate at 1.5%

AUSTRALIA'S annualised rate of inflation fell to 1.5 per cent in the last
quarter of last year, the lowest in almost 30 years.
The underlying rate, which excludes volatile and seasonal factors, also
dropped to 3.4 per cent in the December quarter from 3.7 per cent in the
previous quarter.
In quick reaction to the official figures, Mr Paul Keating, the prime
minister, foreshadowed extra government spending within the current fiscal
year. The additional spending is expected to be announced in an economic
statement next month.
Citing a survey by the National Australia Bank showing Australian companies
to be operating at only 76 per cent capacity, Mr Keating said there was
scope for fiscal expansion.
'Given the level of capacity and the state of the economy, there is minimal
risk on inflation and demand if we stimulate the economy,' he said.
Mr Keating has been under severe pressure from business and trade unions for
some pump priming. During meetings last week with private business, he was
urged by the big banks to spend between ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 620m) and
ADollars 2bn on new government projects. The meetings were designed to get
private business inputs to the February economic statement.
A spending increase would result in a further revision of the 1991-92 budget
deficit. Earlier this month, Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, announced an
increase the budget deficit from ADollars 4.7bn to ADollars 5bn.
Yesterday's announcement said the low inflation figure was due mainly to
decline in housing costs brought on by mortgage interest rates that have
fallen by 12.6 percentage points since the December quarter, 1990. Petrol
prices also dropped by 16 per cent from the high levels during the Gulf
crisis 12 months ago.
