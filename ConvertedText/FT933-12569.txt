FT  23 JUL 93 / Technology: Looking for an easy life in the office - Worth
Watching


Imagine being able to copy a letter, send a fax, scan a document into your
personal computer or print out from it without leaving your desk. Japanese
electronics manufacturer Oki has come up with a single machine that can
perform all four tasks.
The Doc-it has three elements: Windows-based document processing software, a
plug-in PC board and fax interface, and a machine the size of a standard
laser printer that copies, prints, faxes and scans.
The Doc-it will be launched in the UK tomorrow. Oki: Japan, 03 3501 3111;
UK, 081 577 9000.
Document scanners have generally proved too expensive for small businesses
but Xerox Imaging Systems has slashed the price of scanning software with
TextBridge, which sells for Pounds 99. As well as the software, companies
need a desktop or hand-held scanner. Xerox: UK, 0734 668421.
