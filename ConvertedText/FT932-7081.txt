FT  26 MAY 93 / Nato backs Vance-Owen

NATO ministers yesterday tried to keep hopes alive for the Vance-Owen peace
plan in Bosnia, emphasising that the 'safe areas' proposal agreed in
Washington at the weekend should be seen as a means to that end and not a
substitute.
With the main allies reluctant to commit extra troops to the safe areas, the
alliance is considering a limited role in implementing the Washington plan.
Defence ministers made clear that Nato saw its contribution as essentially
restricted to co-ordinating air cover.
The US, Britain, Turkey and the Netherlands, which already have aircraft
enforcing the no-fly zone, indicated they would be prepared to extend their
operations. France, absent from yesterday's talks at Nato headquarters, was
also expected to participate.
Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, attending his first Nato meeting,
suggested ground forces could also draw on Nato command and control
expertise. However, it was not clear where these forces would come from.
Ministers said no plans could be drawn up before a UN Security Council
resolution was passed defining the safe area proposal.
The plan is expected to require several thousand troops in addition to the
9,000 already in Bosnia.
