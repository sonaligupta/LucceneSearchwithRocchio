FT  12 MAR 94 / Quicker land searches urged


   By ALISON SMITH


A call for councils to handle standard land-search inquiries from
prospective homebuyers within 10 working days was made yesterday by Mr John
Gummer, environment secretary.
Mr Gummer, speaking to the Council of Mortgage Lenders as the Department of
the Environment published a consultation paper on plans to make this
mandatory, urged councils to bring in the standard voluntarily before
legislation was introduced.
The proposals include making councils refund all or part of the fee if they
fail to deal with the inquiry within the time limit.
Mr Gummer said the government's aim was to 'ensure that delays with searches
do not emerge again when the housing market picks up'.
Replies to the consultation paper are wanted by early May, but there is no
certainty that the necessary legislation would be included even in the
parliamentary session of 1994-95.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chairman of the CML, reiterated the organisation's
opposition to more cuts in mortgage interest tax relief. He said further
reductions could lead to more repossessions.
