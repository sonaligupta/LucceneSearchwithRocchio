FT  21 JUL 94 / Clash over rail passenger numbers


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


British Rail clashed yesterday with the RMT transport union over the number
of passengers who used the rail service provided on the signal workers'
sixth one-day strike.
The union said that only 10 per cent of the usual number of passengers had
made use of the trains. British Rail said some services had carried
'virtually normal numbers of customers'.
British Rail said it ran 3,800 of its normal 15,000 services, more than in
any strike so far. The Chiltern and the London, Tilbury and Southend lines
carried nearly normal numbers of passengers. Thames Trains carried
two-thirds of usual numbers, while commuter services in the south-east
carried one-third of normal traffic.
Railtrack said it had managed to open 29 per cent of the rail network
compared with 23 per cent last week by 'a better management of resources'.
Train operating companies doubled the number of commuter services into
London Victoria.
The union said the use of supervisors without recent experience of the
signal boxes where they were working posed a safety hazard.
