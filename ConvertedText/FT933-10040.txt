FT  06 AUG 93 / Market testing bulletin planned


THE Cabinet Office is to launch a monthly publication in the autumn to
publicise details of Civil Service work being put out to tender as part of
the market-testing programme.
The Contracts Bulletin will provide information about contracts to supply
services to government departments and agencies. It will also offer an
opportunity to advertise services to government purchasing managers. The
cost will be met by the Pounds 120-a-year subscription.
