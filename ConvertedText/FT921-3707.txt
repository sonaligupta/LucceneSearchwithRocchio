FT  13 MAR 92 / Abandon Eurofighter project, says FDP leader

MR Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats (FDP) in Germany's ruling
coalition, yesterday spoke out against the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA)
being developed jointly with Britain, Italy and Spain.
His intervention in the debate over the fighter, known as the Jager-90 in
Germany, adds to growing resistance in political circles in Bonn to
continued participation in the project, or at least in favour of sharply
reduced German participation.
Mr Lambsdorff said he had long had doubts about the EFA, above all in the
light of the transformation in the world security situation. Although he
could not propose an obvious alternative - the EFA was designed as an
air-to-air fighter specifically for the defensive role required by the
Luftwaffe - 'there is always an alternative'.
He emphasised that if the German purchase of the aircraft were to go ahead,
at the estimated cost of DM26bn (Pounds 9bn) in the long-term defence
budget, 'there would be such an imbalance between the three arms of the
military that the Jager-90 would damage our overall defence capacity'.
Earlier Mr Lambsdorff told Die Welt, the conservative newspaper, it was
clear that 'the Jager-90 will not be built, and I will certainly not vote
for it'.
The fate of the aircraft is still under debate in a working group
representing all three parties in the ruling coalition, in which the FDP is
the junior partner. The group meets again next week, and is supposed to
report by the summer.
The Luftwaffe remains committed to the aircraft, although its budget is
looked at with some fear by the other services. Airforce chiefs from the
four nations this week confirmed their support.
