FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Cherry picking by Conrad


   By NIGEL CLARK


Conrad, the sports and leisure company, is strengthening its team, paying up
to Pounds 1.03m for SLP Consultancy, writes Nigel Clark.
The move adds the defensive capabilities of Mr Trevor Cherry, the former
Leeds United and England fullback, to the attacking brilliance of Mr Bobby
Charlton, the former Manchester United and England forward.
SLP, of which Mr Cherry is managing director, is a marketing and corporate
hospitality company which will link closely with Conrad's Bobby Charlton
International, the soccer consultancy and promotions business.
Mr Ian Townsend, Conrad's finance director, said there would be overlap
where the two companies could help each other.
To help fund the transfer Conrad is raising Pounds 900,000 through the
placing of 25m shares at 4p.
There is an initial signing on fee of Pounds 450,000, satisfied by shares
and Pounds 300,000 cash and a further performance-related payment up to
Pounds 575,000.
