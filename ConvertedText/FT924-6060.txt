FT  24 NOV 92 / Biggest haul of cocaine in UK seized


THE BIGGEST single haul of cocaine in the UK was seized yesterday in an
armed swoop involving the Special Boat Service, armed police and Customs
officers.
The haul, weighing just over a tonne with an estimated street value of
Pounds 160m, was brought into a wharf at Woolwich Reach, London, aboard the
Panamanian-registered vessel Fox Trot Five.
The raid brought cocaine seizures so far this year to about 2.7 tonnes -
more than the total for all of last year, when 1.061 tonnes, worth Pounds
138.4m, was intercepted.
The operation, codenamed Emerge, followed months of intelligence-gathering
and surveillance. The previous record seizure was in July, when 935kg of
cocaine hidden in lead ingots was seized.
