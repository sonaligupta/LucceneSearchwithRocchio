FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright shows sharp rise to Pounds 7.8m
for year


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


CARPETRIGHT, the carpet company to be floated next month by Sir Philip
Harris, made profits of Pounds 7.81m in the year to May 1 this year.
The pre-tax result, up from Pounds 2.81m last time, was struck on sales 47
per cent higher at Pounds 78.6m (Pounds 53.4m). Operating profits jumped to
Pounds 7.47m (Pounds 2.68m) and operating margins were up from 5 per cent to
9.5 per cent.
The figures were revealed yesterday as Carpetright issued it pathfinder
prospectus ahead of a pricing decision on June 8.
Some 35 per cent of the shares are to be made available to the public. Sir
Philip and companies controlled by him will end up with approximately 20 per
cent of the company and his family will have a further 10 per cent.
Sir Philip confirmed that the flotation would be used to repay preference
share holders. He said the cash generative company would not make
acqsuisitions.
It would, however, consider buying small groups of carpet shops in order to
help it reach its target of increasing the number of outlets from 116 to 200
in the next three years.
County Natwest is sponsoring and underwriting the float while SG Warburg is
broker.
