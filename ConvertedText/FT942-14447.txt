FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Regina Pounds 269,000 in the red


   By SIMON DAVIES


Regina, the USM-quoted royal jelly company, yesterday announced pre-tax
losses of Pounds 269,000 for the six months ended February, against Pounds
143,000 profits previously.
The announcement of the results was brought forward to provide further
ammunition for the current directors in their attempts to fight off Mr
Shiraz Malik-Noor, the former chairman, who is trying to regain control of
the board.
The company saw sales drop by 43 per cent at the interim stage to Pounds
683,000 (Pounds 1.19m).
Losses per share were 0.19p compared with 0.09p earnings.
Mr Malik-Noor was removed in March and is pushing for reinstatement at an
extraordinary meeting on Monday.
The company's problems, however, appear to have started long before he
joined.
It has lost close to Pounds 7m in the last four and a half years, of which
Pounds 5m was suffered before Mr Malik-Noor took any executive
responsibilities.
