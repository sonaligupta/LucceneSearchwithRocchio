FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont considers corporate tax rise


MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, is looking at the possibility of
increasing taxes as part of his strategy to reduce the public sector
borrowing requirement, expected to be Pounds 50bn this year.
In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Lamont said he intended to address the
tax side of the PSBR gap as well as trying to curb public expenditure. 'I am
worried about the fall in the tax ratio,' he said.
The chancellor said he was particularly concerned about the 'very large
number of companies with unused tax allowances' which shield their profits
from tax.
'One of the questions I am interested in is to what extent our corporation
tax reforms have actually lessened the yield from companies below what we
might have expected.
'I wholly approve of the changes (former chancellor) Nigel Lawson made to
company tax but I am just examining whether the loss revenue is somewhat
greater than what we anticipated.'
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said last night that he would be calling
for a statement from Mr Lamont on public spending and his comments on tax.
