FT  24 NOV 92 / Ballot on strike at Ford


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


SHOP STEWARDS at Ford, UK the leader in the market for new cars, voted
yesterday to ballot on strike action over job losses.
Officials voted unanimously ballot the 25,000 hourly paid workers as soon as
possible on industrial action up to and including a strike. Union leaders
are recommending a 'yes' vote and believe strike action is possible.
In September Ford said it wanted a reduction of 1,487 in the workforces of
its Halewood, Merseyside, and Dagenham, east London, plants. It wanted
voluntary cuts but said that if numbers had not been achieved by December 11
they would be compulsory.
Unions were offered an alternative: a six-month pay freeze and a cut in
lay-off payments. That was rejected this month.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union, said that
the strike ballot decision had not been taken lightly. He said that Ford
clearly found it easier to shed UK workers rather than German or Spanish
workers.
Today hourly paid workers receive the second phase of a two-year pay deal,
which will give them a 5 per cent rise.
