FT  06 AUG 93 / Positive debut for merged publisher


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE NEWEST Anglo-Dutch collaboration, Reed Elsevier, the international
publishing and information group, yesterday unveiled a 24 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits in its first set of results since the merger.
Currency movements favoured the first-half figures, which rose from Pounds
227m to Pounds 281m before tax and a Pounds 16m (Pounds 17m) gain on asset
sales.
The performance from putting together businesses such as Reed's IPC
Magazines and Elsevier's scientific journals represented an increase of 13
per cent in constant currency terms.
'We are pleased that this first set of results for Reed Elsevier shows a
strong performance,' said the chairmen, Mr Pierre Vinken of Elsevier, and Mr
Peter Davis of Reed International. Both companies are separately quoted on
both the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges.
They warned, however, that economic conditions remained difficult in two of
their main markets - the UK and the US - and had deteriorated further in
continental Europe.
The one surprise was the poor performance of medical publishing with profits
down more than 50 per cent. Markets were weak and uncertainty affected
pharmaceutical advertising in the US, Germany and Italy. Overall the
scientific and medical division lifted operating profits 13 per cent to
Pounds 76m.
Professional publishing showed a 30 per cent profit rise to Pounds 60m, and
the consumer division was up 23 per cent to Pounds 54m with good
performances from books and IPC magazines. The business division contributed
Pounds 105m, up 13 per cent.
'The results are reasonable by any standard,' Mr Guy Lamming, media analyst,
said yesterday. Analysts are looking for Pounds 517m to Pounds 520m for the
full year, excluding proceeds from selling a stake in British Sky
Broadcasting.
For Reed International shareholders, earnings per share grew 21 per cent
under FRS3 accounting rules to 21p. Reed has declared a dividend of 7.5p, up
3 per cent.
Earnings per share for Elsevier shareholders, under FRS3, went up 8 per cent
to Fl 4.41, with a dividend of Fl 1.67.
