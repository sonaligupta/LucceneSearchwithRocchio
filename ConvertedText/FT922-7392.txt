FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Misys expands insurance interests


Misys, an acquisitive computing services group recovering from a poor 1991,
is strengthening its activities in insurance services through the purchase
of Countrywide Holdings (UK) and Countrywide Management Group.
It has agreed terms for the acquisition of the 76.8 per cent of Holdings and
81.9 per cent of Management it does not already own. The offers, in shares
with a cash alternative, value Holdings at Pounds 6.5m and Management at
Pounds 4.9m.
Last year Holdings made pre-tax profits of Pounds 845,000 on revenues of
Pounds 3.5m, while Management lost Pounds 245,000 on revenues of Pounds
1.7m.
The two companies will be incorporated into Misys Financial Systems, which
provides software systems to the insurance intermediary market. Misys and
Countrywide have pioneered electronic trading of insurance products.
