FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Renault improves 85% despite
loss in final term

RENAULT, the French state-controlled carmaker, fell deeply into loss in the
final quarter of last year but still managed to report a nearly doubled
annual net profit of FFr5.7bn (Dollars 1.04bn).
Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman, warned this year would be 'execrable', and
that profits would fall. He forecast a 9 per cent to 10 per cent decline in
the European car market, the steepest since the 1974 oil price crisis.
Renault, 80 per cent owned by the state and 20 per cent owned by Volvo, its
Swedish partner, is a possible privatisation candidate.
Net profits at Renault rose by 84.5 per cent on turnover up by 8.1 per cent
to FFr179.4bn. Car sales, the source of the earnings increase, climbed by 12
per cent to FFr150bn. With just over 2m vehicles sold - up 6.7 per cent -
Renault managed its best unit sales performance for nine years.
Operating profits rose to FFr7.92bn from FFr4.66bn, one of the best
performances from a leading car company, in what had been an exceptional
year, said Mr Schweitzer. Within this, the car division rose to FFr8.69bn
last year from FFr4.67bn.
However, the group made a FFr961m pre-tax loss in the final quarter of 1992,
due to a FFr600m decline in franc income from the devaluation of sterling
and the lira against the French currency, FFr956m of exceptional charges and
Renault's share of Volvo's losses. Currency shifts will this year remove
another FFr3bn from taxable profits at Renault, which does not hedge against
exchange rate shifts, said Mr Schweitzer.
Volvo contributed a FFr1.37bn loss for the full year, on top of a FFr1.15bn
loss from Renault's truck division. There were signs that recovery at Volvo
and Renault's truck division would eventually become profitable, said Mr
Schweitzer.
Registrations of Renault cars in a stagnant European market rose by 5.8 per
cent last year, helped by a strong rise in French sales. This allowed the
French group to lift its European market share from 10 per cent to 10.6 per
cent. The group has a more than 5 per cent market share in every European
country except Britain, where it will pass that benchmark this year, he
said.
Finance charges fell to FFr831m from FFr1.19bn in 1991, thanks to a fall in
debt to FFr12.55bn from FFr15.53bn net over the same period. That leaves
gearing at 37 per cent of shareholders' equity of FFr33.97bn.
