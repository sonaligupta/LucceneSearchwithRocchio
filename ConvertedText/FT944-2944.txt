FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MAM put in offer period


The Takeover Panel yesterday placed Mercury Asset Management, the fund
management company which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, in an offer
period because of Warburg's intention to merge with Morgan Stanley.
The decision follows market speculation over whether Warburg and Morgan
Stanley will make an offer to acquire the 25 per cent minority stake in MAM
to merge it with Morgan Stanley's fund management arm. It means that
relevant share dealings by Warburg, Morgan Stanley and MAM, and connected
parties, have to be disclosed.
The panel could eventually force Warburg and Morgan Stanley to make a tender
offer for the MAM minority under the 'chain principle', if it decided that a
main purpose of the merger was to acquire the assets of MAM.
