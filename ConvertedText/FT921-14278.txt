FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Bombardier to finalise takeover

MR LAURENT Beaudoin, chairman of Bombardier, the aerospace and transit
equipment group, is expected to confirm tomorrow his company's imminent
takeover of De Havilland Canada (DHC) from Boeing.
Bombardier has been negotiating details of the deal, following the European
Commission's refusal to allow acquisition of DHC by France's Aerospatiale
and Alenia of Italy, makers of the successful ATR, on competition grounds.
Bombardier will basically pay CDollars 51m (USDollars 43.9m) for 51 per cent
of DHC, builder of the Dash 8 commuter aircraft. The Ontario government,
anxious to save jobs in Toronto, where DHC's plant is located, will put up
CDollars 49m for 49 per cent. Bombardier will have an option to buy out
Ontario's stake, but will immediately take full operating control.
Nearly 400 Dash 8 aircraft in 30- and 50-seat configurations have been built
or are on order. But Bombardier will push subcontracting work for Boeing and
Airbus into the DHC operation.
Two key agreements have been needed to complete the deal. Bombardier wanted
at least CDollars 300m from the Ontario government to compensate for
expected losses on existing DHC contracts.
It also wanted guarantees of federal export finance to help DHC compete in
foreign markets.
Bombardier also expects significant long-term government help to finance a
larger version of the Dash 8, plus training and research grants. Its demands
for pay concessions and job flexibility have already been accepted by the
Canadian Autoworkers' union.
