FT  22 APR 91 / Letter: Pension choice


   From Mr ROGER LYONS


Sir, When Mr Peter Stirrup, the chairman of the National Association of
Pension Funds (Letters, April 15) argues that pension schemes should not be
forced to make retrospective changes in order to give sex equality, he is
actually arguing for sex discrimination to continue for another 40 years.
His argument that pensions are earned is certainly one trade unions support
but it has taken the European Court to establish the principle that pensions
are deferred pay, something opposed by the government and the NAPF.
The nature of company pension schemes is such that their members'
entitlement to benefit is not really determined until they cease
contributing, for whatever reason. Schemes have been only too happy to make
retrospective changes to the benefits of early leavers including those whom
sponsoring companies have made redundant. Benefit structures do provide for
such contingencies but schemes have been happy to profit at the expense of
members' lost expectations. Now the reverse situation applies, but despite
large surpluses they are resisting members' new expectations of equality.
Trade unions believe that a fundamental principle is involved in ending sex
discrimination and so we want equality at the earliest possible date. Legal
commentators not dancing to the company tune, orchestrated by the NAPF,
believe the European Court was inclined to support this view and intended
all pensions claimed after its judgement to be equal.
Finally, Mr Stirrup should have declared, in saying the NAPF is keen for
equality as soon as possible, that it is advocating equality at 65.
In other words, it is not influenced by the news that most pension scheme
members want the choice of being able to retire on a full pension at 60.
