FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Supremo becomes executive director at British Steel


Jeff Edington, whose appointment in 1992 as British Steel's technology
supremo was welcomed by industry observers, has been appointed an executive
director at the UK steelmaker.
Edington joined British Steel as managing director, technology, after 10
years at Alcan Aluminium in Montreal, and has a mission to redress the
balance between use of steel and that of faster-growing aluminium.
David Grieves, an executive director and vice-chairman at British Steel,
will retire from the board in July after 37 years in the UK steel industry.
Grieves is chairman of Avesta Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel
producer formed in 1992.
