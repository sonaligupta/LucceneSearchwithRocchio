FT  23 NOV 92 / UK Company News: McInerney losses reduced to IPounds 1.2m


McInerney Properties, which builds private houses in Ireland and leisure
related activities in Spain and Portugal, cut its pre-tax loss from IPounds
2.45m to IPounds 1.2m, or Pounds 1.3m, over the first half of 1992.
The second half will show some loss. Expectation of more stable markets in
1993 should enable the group to reap the benefits of the recent financial
restructuring and hasten the return to profitability, which should come in
1994.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 300,000 were made this time. Provisions
covered possible increased future costs which might arise from recent
currency movements, and costs relating to the financial restructuring.
Turnover in the half year came to IPounds 15m (IPounds 14m), while losses
per share declined to 2.13p (3.93p).
