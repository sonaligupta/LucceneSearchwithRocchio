FT  08 NOV 93 / Iraq trade claim about Thatcher


A LETTER disclosed in a book to be published on Wednesday reveals that
Baroness Thatcher was made aware in December 1988 of suspicions that
Allivane, a British defence company, was being used to ship war equipment to
Iraq.
The letter, published in the book Spider's Web by former Financial Times
journalist Alan Friedman, was written by Mr Frank Machon of the Machon group
of companies and sent to Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, on December 23
1988. Mr Machon alleged in the letter that, when granting Allivane Saudi
export licences, ministers in either Britain or the US were 'funnelling war
equipment through Allivane which is certainly destined for Iraq.'
The letter is likely to provide further evidence for Lord Justice Scott, who
is leading an inquiry into the sale of arms to Iraq.
