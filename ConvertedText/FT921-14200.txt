FT  17 JAN 92 / Aid donors are being asked to channel some of their
assistance to the former Soviet republics

AID donors are being asked to channel some of their assistance to the former
Soviet republics through the countries of eastern and central Europe, so
helping them to maintain some of their lost Soviet export markets, George
Graham reports from Washington.
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are hoping for a triangular trade in
which donor nations would finance the purchase of food and pharmaceuticals
from their countries, to be delivered as aid to the ex-Soviet lands.
Officials of the three countries met in Budapest this week to agree their
approach, and are hoping to use the aid conference in Washington next week
to secure commitments by donors such as the Gulf states and Japan.
In an operation that could be a precedent, the European Community last year
funded a shipment of 300,000 tonnes of wheat from Hungary to Albania.
However, eastern European diplomats are concentrating their efforts on
donors lacking large agricultural surpluses, which they are keen to supply
as aid.
Eastern European diplomats say they would like to divide these triangular
deals roughly in line with the market shares they used to have for various
types of product in the Soviet Union, but cannot be precise on aid sought.
