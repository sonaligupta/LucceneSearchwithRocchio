FT  23 JUL 93 / MPs urge review of buses shake-up


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


THE GOVERNMENT should reconsider plans to deregulate London's buses if they
mean abandoning the travelcard season ticket, MPs warned yesterday, Richard
Tomkins writes.
The Commons transport committee said loss of the travelcard, or similar
concessions, would be 'too high a price to pay for the speculative benefits
of deregulation'.
Deregulating the bus market in London would bring the capital in line with
the rest of the country, where operators have been free to run any services
they choose since 1986.
Ministers are expected to bring forward legislation for deregulation in the
next session of parliament.
The government yesterday said the Yorkshire Traction Bus Company could take
over Lincoln City Transport without reference to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
