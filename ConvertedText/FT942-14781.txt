FT  19 APR 94 / People: Financial health of NHS


The National Health Service Executive has for the first time appointed an
insider as director of finance. Colin Reeves, finance director for the North
West Thames regional health authority since 1986, will succeed Gordon
Greenshields whose secondment from Coopers and Lybrand, the accountants, is
due to end this month.
Reeves, 45, has an economics degree from Clare College, Cambridge, and a
doctorate in monetary economics from Bangor University. He qualified as an
accountant in local government, joining the health service in 1984 as deputy
finance director for North West Thames. In the past two years he chaired a
group on costing.
In his new role, Reeves will be responsible for the financial management of
the health service. His priority will be to ensure that health authorities
and trusts have sound financial plans and systems to deliver the improvement
in services the government wants to see from its reform programme.
At North West Thames, Reeves worked under Alan Langlands, who was general
manager of the region before becoming NHS chief executive at the beginning
of the month. His appointment follows an open competition which attracted a
wide field of candidates from the public and private sectors.
