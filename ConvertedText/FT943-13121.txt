FT  21 JUL 94 / World News in Brief: Cholera outbreak feared among refugees


Cholera has already claimed its first victims among the million Rwandan
refugees crowded into the Zairean town of Goma, western doctors believe.
Jacques de Milliano, head of medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, said
his medical teams had reported around 120 cases of suspected cholera. If
tests confirm the presence of the disease, between 5,000 and 10,000 of the
refugees are expected to die of it. Editorial Comment, Page 21
