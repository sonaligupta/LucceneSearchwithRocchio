FT  07 JAN 94 / Lloyd's expects a substantial rise in business


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Lloyd's, the London insurance market, expects to increase its business
substantially this year, despite reporting record losses in 1993 and earlier
fears of an erosion of its capital base.
The market's capacity - the premiums its underwriting syndicates are allowed
to accept - is expected to rise to between Pounds 10.5bn and Pounds 11bn in
1994, from Pounds 8.7bn in 1993, according to figures released yesterday.
Of the fresh capacity, Pounds 1.6bn will be supplied by new corporate
investment trusts. But Names have also increased their commitments. On
average, they will underwrite Pounds 505,000 each in 1994, compared with
Pounds 454,000 in 1993.
Provisional figures indicate that 954 of Lloyd's 19,537 Names have resigned
and 180 have died over the past 12 months. Only 63 new individual Names will
begin underwriting in 1994.
'Our members have been very resilient,' said Mr David Rowland, chairman.
Lloyd's, which completes its accounts three years in arrears, reported
losses of Pounds 2.9bn for the 1990 underwriting year, and expects to record
another year of losses of more than Pounds 1bn when it reports for 1991 in
May. But the market expects to make profits in 1993 and 1994, as a result of
steep increases in insurance rates and greater efficiency.
In a separate move, Lloyd's said yesterday it was extending the deadline for
acceptance of its Pounds 900m settlement offer to 22,921 loss-making Names
by two weeks to February 14.
The delay follows amendments to the original settlement offer which
contained arithmetical and other errors.
Mr Rowland said the majority of affected Names will 'receive an increased
offer' but that many would suffer a reduction. Nearly Pounds 20.83m will be
redistributed from 10,071 Names to 12,850 other Names.
The offer is designed to settle litigation by more than three dozen groups
of Names who are claiming compensation from their agents for billions of
pounds of losses. Each Name will receive a 'bespoke' offer with compensation
varying according to exposure to loss-making syndicates, membership of
Names' action groups and the progress of legal action.
Lloyd's confirmed it was 'unlikely' that loss-making Names who refuse to
accept the settlement offer will be able to claim so-called 'hardship'
relief.
It emerged yesterday that losses incurred between 1986 and 1991 and faced by
4,500 Gooda Walker Names increased during 1993 by Pounds 94.6m. GW Run-Off,
the agency managing the syndicates' affairs, said the losses of syndicates
164, 290, 295, 296, 298 and 299 amounted to Pounds 835m at the end of 1993
and could total Pounds 1.1bn.
