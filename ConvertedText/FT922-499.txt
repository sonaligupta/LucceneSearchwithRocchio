FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: China Steel offer
undersubscribed


   By REUTER


   TAIPEI


THE PUBLIC offer of shares in China Steel worth TDollars 10.8bn (Dollars
437m) has closed just 38 per cent subscribed, dealing a severe blow to the
government's privatisation programme, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The 509.5m shares being offered by the government were priced at TDollars
21.14 each. China Steel, which is already listed in Taipei, ended at
TDollars 21.90 yesterday.
Underwriters were yesterday scrambling to place shares with institutional
investors, but clearly will be forced to hold on to many of the shares
themselves.
The issue was linked to last month's offer of global depositary receipts in
the US, Japan and Europe, the first overseas share offer by a Taiwan
company. The GDR issue, 360m shares for some Dollars 320m, was heavily
oversubscribed with demand exceeding supply by a ratio of three to one.
