FT  19 APR 91 / Big trade surplus for TVs


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER


BRITAIN'S trade surplus in colour television sets rose to a record Pounds
271m last year as UK-based manufacturers responded to depressed domestic
demand by increasing exports.
Exports of colour sets were worth Pounds 471m last year, compared with
Pounds 301m in 1989, according to the British Radio and Electronic Equipment
Manufacturers' Association. Imports fell from Pounds 243m in 1989 to Pounds
200m last year.
The increased surplus has been achieved even though there are no longer any
British-owned television manufacturers. The leading exporters are Japanese
companies which began building factories in the UK in the 1970s. Ferguson,
the last big UK-owned manufacturer of TV sets, was bought by Thomson of
France in 1987.
The manufacturers' association said home demand was depressed last year,
with UK sales of television sets falling 9 per cent to 3.4m units.
The UK's trade deficit in video cassette recorders fell slightly to Pounds
48m last year, against Pounds 49m in 1989.
