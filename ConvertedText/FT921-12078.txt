FT  29 JAN 92 / Israel worried over Iran's nuclear plans

ISRAEL, for years a discreet partner with Iran against Arab powers, has
begun to voice concern over Tehran's military ambitions, saying it is in the
early stages of developing a domestic nuclear weapons programme similar to
that pursued by Iraq.
This week, the defence establishment has alleged publicly that unspecified
German and other European companies, some of whom previously co-operated
with Iraqi non-conventional arms projects, were now working in Iran.
'Israel will not remain inactive on the subject of German and European aid
to Iran in the development of nuclear and chemical weapons and will not
remain indifferent to the active threat of an extreme and unpredictable
regime,' Mr Eliyahu Ben Elisar, chairman of the Knesset foreign affairs and
defence committee, told Ha'aretz newspaper.
In the past, notably during the reign of the late Shah, Israel itself traded
oil, arms, equipment and technological know-how with Iran, which it
cultivated as an important regional counterweight to Arab states. Contacts
survived the Shah's overthrow, despite the advent of the virulently
anti-Israeli Khomeini regime, and Israel continued to supply arms during the
Iran-Iraq war.
In late 1989, the US confirmed Israel had bought oil from Iran in a deal
linked to efforts to win the freedom of Israeli servicemen held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.
Now, however, with those efforts still frustrated, officials say they are
worried by Iranian ambitions to become a dominant regional power, filling
the vacuum left by Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War a year ago. Their concern
has been heightened by Iran's opposition to Middle East peace talks, which
most Arab states have accepted, and its efforts to forge ties with Islamic
former Soviet Asian republics.
In off-the-record briefings, military sources have said Tehran is in the
early stages of a nuclear programme which, if successful, could produce an
'Islamic bomb' by the end of the decade. They say it is modelled on the
Iraqi efforts to acquire foreign technology.
They say Iran is seeking co-operation with China and Pakistan, having
ordered a small reactor and acquired a 'calutron' isotope isolation device
from Beijing for research purposes. It is also trying to buy a 5-10 megawatt
reactor from India.
The sources say Israel has no evidence that Soviet nuclear scientists have
been brought to Iran, as some reports have suggested. But they say links
have been made with European companies -which they did not name - for the
supply of equipment with nuclear uses.
Israel is also worried by Iran's conventional forces. The sources say Tehran
acquired 'several dozen' 500km-range, Scud-C ballistic missiles from North
Korea last year to add to its shorter-range Scud-B rockets, and has plans to
acquire longer-range missiles.
Iran, the sources say, has shown no sign of giving back more than 100 Iraqi
jets whose pilots flew them across the border during the Gulf War.
