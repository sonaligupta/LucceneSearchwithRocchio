FT  03 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wheat crop forecast
raised


THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Forecasters consultancy has raised its forecast for the
Australian wheat crop to 15m tonnes for the year ending March 31 1994, up
from last month's prediction of 14.9m tonnes but still below last year's
actual crop of 15.33m tonnes.
AWF put the area sown to wheat at 9.75m hectares in 1993/94 compared with
last month's forecast of 9.9m and 9.07m last year.
It said the development of the Western Australian wheat crop had been the
most significant event over the past month, with regular rain and early
sowing suggesting that the state should produce wheats of higher than
average protein levels.
