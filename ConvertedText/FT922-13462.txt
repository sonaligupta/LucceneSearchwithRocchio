rises overseas

SHARP rises in leading overseas markets prompted short-covering and
bargain-hunting in Japanese blue chips, and the Nikkei average surged
1,252.51 or 7.6 per cent to close at the day's high of 17,850.66, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The jump in the Nikkei was also fuelled by heavy futures-linked buying. The
index opened at the day's low of 16,622.24, but despite the day's gains, it
was still down 3.8 per cent on the week.
Volume rose to 380m shares from 350m shares. Advances outnumbered declines
by 966 to 67 with 56 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks advanced 86.37 or 7.2 per cent to 1,282.56. In London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index rose 7.05 to 1,047.32.
Market participants were encouraged by the cut in the US Federal Fund rate
and the ensuing rally in the US stock and bond markets. Japanese bonds and
the yen also firmed in response.
Comments by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that the government was
considering allowing public pension funds to invest in the stock market
improved sentiment. Some domestic institutions were seen buying blue chip
issues towards the close.
Mr David Stuart at James Capel said the market was looking oversold, and
only needed a simple trigger to rise. However, he added that if short-term
interest rates do not decline next week, the Nikkei index could test new
lows.
Mr Yasuo Ueki, head of Nikko Securities' equity division, said short-term
traders, who had sold heavily on Thursday, were covering short positions.
However, he added that with the Nikkei rebounding over 1,000 points in one
day, share prices had bottomed out for the time being.
Foreign buying of bank shares after their recent slide helped the Nikkei to
recover. Several banks rose by their daily limits. Industrial Bank of Japan
rose Y200 to Y1,560 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced Y200 to Y1,500.
Industrial blue chips were stronger. Nippon Steel rose Y15 to Y295 and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries firmed Y58 to Y569.
Electricals were stronger, led by Teac which advanced Y100 to Y975. NEC rose
Y59 to Y1,000 and Hitachi turned up Y38 to Y810.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y18,000 to Y608,000. Other leading
gainers included low liquidity Nikkei component shares. Daito Woollen
Spinning and Weaving rose Y36 to Y810 and Godo Shusei added Y33 to Y923.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 904.22 to 19,249.77 in volume of 14.7m
shares.
