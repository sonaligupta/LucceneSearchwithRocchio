   BEIJING


China's economic boom this year has forced officials to come up with a new
definition for 'well-off', reflecting climbing living standards across the
country, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The official Xinhua news agency said yesterday the new state standard for
well-off urban residents set annual per capita income at Yn2,380 (Dollars
410) and the average life span at 70 years.
The average well-off urban resident would have at least nine years of
schooling and a paid two-week vacation every year.
In rural areas, the average well-off person would make a per capita income
of Yn1,100, spend Yn70 a year on clothes, own a television and live in a
village with at least one telephone.
Xinhua said that some 57 per cent of Chinese people already qualified as
well off.
