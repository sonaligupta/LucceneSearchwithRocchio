FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Audi - Other Companies


Under orders from the Volkswagen group's demanding chief, Mr Ferdinand
Piech, the Audi board is expected to present an upbeat view of prospects at
its press conference on Thursday. High hopes are attached to the marque's
lightweight aluminium model for heavyweight executives, and to its
performance estate (made by Porsche). The bad news is that while other
German car marques are forging ahead in the US market, Audi is still stuck
in reverse.
