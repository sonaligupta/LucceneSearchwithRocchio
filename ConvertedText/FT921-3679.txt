FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Decathalon drain clears the way


   By IAN HOLDSWORTH


A NEW KIND of drain that can clear large volumes of water and clean itself
at the same time has been developed by UK engineering group Hodkin and
Jones, Ian Holdsworth writes.
The group claims its Decathlon drain is capable of clearing up to 192 litres
of water per second. This is at least 50 per cent more efficient than a
conventional drain.
Decathlon's cross-section resembles that of a flower-pot rather than the
traditional circle or inverted egg which has been in widespread use since
Victorian times.
With this profile, the drain expels water even when it is flat, says Hodkin
and Jones. A normal drain must be laid at a gradient. 'An ordinary circular
drain works well up to two-thirds of its capacity,' says David Monks, Hodkin
and Jones's chairman. 'Above that you get air blockages in the system - but
that can't happen with our drain.'
