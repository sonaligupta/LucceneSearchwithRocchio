FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris may separate
businesses


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Philip Morris, the US food, beer and tobacco group that makes Marlboro, the
world's biggest-selling cigarette, is considering splitting its tobacco
operations from the rest of the business.
The aim is to limit the damage caused by the problems afflicting its
domestic tobacco business.
Mr Hans Storr, executive vice-president and chief financial officer, said
that the plan was one of several options being studied by the group as a
means of enhancing the value of Philip Morris shares.
Mr Storr emphasised that no decisions had been taken and that other options
were available, such as continuing with the company's aggressive share
repurchase plan. Philip Morris bought back 3 per cent of its shares last
year.
However, Mr Storr said it was clear that Philip Morris's share price was
suffering excessively from the problems associated with the domestic tobacco
business, and the group was seeking a solution. 'We are keenly interested in
shareholder value, and we are very distressed at the present low value of
the stock,' Mr Storr said.
Like other US tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris is facing increasingly
intense opposition to its cigarette products from politicians and
anti-smoking groups. It is also facing a tough fight in Congress over
President Clinton's plan to help pay for healthcare reform with a steep rise
in cigarette tax.
Meanwhile, it continues to suffer the effects of last year's cigarette price
war in the US.
Philip Morris's interest in splitting its tobacco and food businesses echoes
a similar proposal by RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group, last
summer.
RJR Nabisco's plan foundered because Wall Street disliked the structure of
the scheme, but the company is expected to come back with a fresh attempt at
a stock split this year.
