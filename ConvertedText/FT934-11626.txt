FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals and interest charges behind
Pounds 1.04bn loss


   By MAGGIE URRY


THE DETAIL of Queens Moat Houses' 1992 results reveals a staggering list of
exceptional items and prior year adjustments, headed by a property
revaluation cutting assets by Pounds 803.9m.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis assuming the
financial restructuring now being discussed is completed and the group's
banks continue to support it. Even without the property write-down, Mr
Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said that a refinancing would have been
necessary as the group could not service its debt.
Although the group almost broke even at the operating level, losing Pounds
700,000 compared with a restated profit of Pounds 22.4m, exceptional debits
of Pounds 939m and interest charges of Pounds 112.6m gave a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 1.04bn.
The 1991 pre-tax profit of Pounds 90.4m was restated as a loss of Pounds
56.3m before tax following changes in accounting policies.
The Pounds 146.7m difference included Pounds 50.9m of depreciation which the
group had not previously provided and maintenance expenditure which it had
formerly capitalised. Other changes related to profits on fixed asset sales
which had been overstated, expenses which had been capitalised and sale and
leaseback transactions which have now been treated as finance leases.
The total loss for 1992 was Pounds 1.07bn (loss of Pounds 102.5m), and
losses per share were 116.4p (8.5p).
Interim results up to July 4 show an operating profit of Pounds 9.1m, but
after net interest of Pounds 57.5m, the pre-tax loss was Pounds 48.4m. The
group said it could not restate the 1992 interim figures as the papers from
which they had originally been constructed could not be found. In August
last year the group reported an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 38.1m.
The end-1992 balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 1.17bn and negative net
worth of Pounds 388.9m. By July 4 debt had risen to Pounds 1.18bn and
negative net worth fallen further to Pounds 435.5m.
Fixed assets, shown in the 1991 accounts at Pounds 2.12bn had fallen to
Pounds 891.1m by the end of 1992 and Pounds 855.7m by July 4.
