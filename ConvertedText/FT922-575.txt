FT  26 JUN 92 / Observer: Ill fated legacy


There is more than a touch of irony about the fact that the very day Sir
Peter Walters's Midland Bank jumps into bed with its Hong Kong suitor, Sir
Peter's other great scheme - his own carefully laid succession plan at BP -
goes off with a loud bang.
Whilst attention will be rightly focused on the reasons for Bob Horton's
early departure - which may have as much to do with his personality as with
his strategy - it should not be forgotten that he has only been doing the
job for just over two years. Most of BP's problems are not of his making.
By comparison, Walters's tenure at the top of the group was always felt to
have been a success. This may have to be reviewed. After all, the mark of a
great company chairman is being able to pick the right successor.
When Horton beat David Simon in the race for the top seat, there was some
surprise that BP had opted for the prickly trouble-shooter over his smoother
rival. Walters must shoulder some of the blame for making the wrong choice.
What a contrast it all makes with the Royal Dutch Shell group which quietly
changes its boss next Wednesday. Hands up, anyone who can name him.
