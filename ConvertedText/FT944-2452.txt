FT  16 DEC 94 / 'Homes for votes' inquiry adjourned


   By ROB EVANS


The public inquiry into alleged gerrymandering at Westminster City Council
has been adjourned, delaying its completion until the new year.
The inquiry was due to end in the middle of next week, but was adjourned so
that questions could be answered in writing by an important witness - Mr
Jeremy Sullivan QC, the barrister who advised councillors on the legality of
their actions.
Many of those accused of gerrymandering through the sale of council homes
have said that they received advice from Mr Sullivan approving the sales.
They have argued that such legal advice should protect them from being
surcharged Pounds 21.25m - the money allegedly wasted through the sales.
However, there is a dispute over what was actually said at a meeting on May
5, 1987 between Mr Sullivan and three council officials.
Last week district auditor Mr John Magill put a series of written questions
to Mr Sullivan to clarify the advice he gave at the meeting.
Yesterday Mr Magill approved an application to put further questions to Mr
Sullivan. This was made by Mr Christopher Clarke QC, representing one of the
accused, Mr Robert Lewis, former deputy chief solicitor at the council who
was at the meeting.
