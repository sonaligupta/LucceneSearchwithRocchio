FT  16 JAN 92 / Falling house prices curb Israeli inflation


   By HUGH CARNEGY


ISRAELI inflation totalled 18 per cent in 1991, less than had been feared
and only slightly up on 17.6 per cent in 1990.
The biggest single factor was the surge in housing costs, which rose 28 per
cent overall as fears of an immigration-induced housing shortage drove up
prices and rents.
But Russian immigrants' reluctance to take on high levels of debt to
purchase property, and rising availability of new stock arising from a
construction boom, abruptly reversed the trend in the last quarter, when
house prices fell 4 per cent.
As a result inflation quickly fell back from annual rates approaching 25 per
cent, a level which threatened government efforts to maintain economic
stability in the face af large-scale immigration. Prices in the last quarter
rose less than 1 per cent, against 6 per cent in the third quarter.
Officials are forecasting a further modest cooling in inflation this year.
But the relatively good news on prices also contains some bad news:
construction was the main engine of growth last year and this has flattened
as the building boom has tailed off. There are fears that unemployment,
already at record levels of close to 11 per cent, will go on rising as more
immigrants enter the job market.
