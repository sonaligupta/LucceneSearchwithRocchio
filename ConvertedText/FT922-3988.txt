FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: S Africa's Stanbic wins British
bank licence


   By REUTER


   JOHANNESBURG


SOUTH AFRICA'S Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic) said its wholly-owned
subsidiary Standard Bank London had been authorised by the Bank of England
to begin banking in Britain, Reuters reports from Johannesburg.
A statement said it was the first British banking licence issued to a South
African bank since the imposition in 1985 of an international moratorium on
South African debt repayments.
Standard Bank London would perform the financial services of Stanbic's
current UK representative office and its existing London subsidiary,
Standard London.
The new subsidiary would play a central role in Stanbic's international
network and facilitate trade and capital flows between southern Africa and
the rest of the world.
Standard London currently deals with trade and loan finance, is a
market-maker in South African equities and all rand-related currency and
treasury products and takes part in the market in East European, African and
South American debt.
Stanbic described the launch of Standard Bank London as part of a strategy
to support customers' global business.
