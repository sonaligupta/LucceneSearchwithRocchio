FT  25 AUG 92 / Annual health spending forecast to top Pounds 40bn


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


   HEALTHCARE spending in the UK will top Pounds 40bn this year


about Pounds 640 per person  - according to figures published today by the
Office of Health Economics, the research unit funded by the British
pharmaceutical industry.
Per capita health spending has almost doubled in real terms since 1973,
rising from 4.6 per cent of gross domestic product to an all-time high of
6.5 per cent. The growth in the private health sector has been particularly
marked, with spending on private healthcare rising three times as fast as
spending on the National Health Service.
The figures, published in the eighth OHE Compendium of Health Statistics,
demonstrate the inexorable rise in the cost of the NHS.
The gross cost of the NHS is estimated to reach a record Pounds 35bn by the
end of this year, double the level in 1973 in real terms. Growth in real
terms has, however, slowed markedly from 5.5 per cent a year in the 1960s
and 1970s to just 3 per cent in the 1980s. At 88 per cent of the total, the
NHS now accounts for a lower proportion of total UK health spending than
previously.
Spending on non-prescribed pharmaceutical products amounts to Pounds 2.1bn,
with private healthcare worth Pounds 2.8bn. Private medical insurance covers
one in six households, with a record 7.5m people (13 per cent of the UK
population).
Although the coverage of the private healthcare sector has almost doubled in
size every 10 years over the past four decades, the total spent remains
relatively small at about Pounds 400 per insured household per year.
The UK continues to lag behind other industrialised countries in the level
of its health spending. The average for members of the Organisation of
Economic Co-operation and Development is 9 per cent of GDP, with countries
such as France and Canada spending a quarter more per person than the UK.
The compendium also shows the considerable growth in the NHS workforce, up
from 575,000 in 1961 to 1.2m last year. Most of this rise has been in the
hospital sector, with about two thirds contributed by nurses, midwives and
medical staff.
There has been a sizeable reduction in the number of hospitals in this
period, however, down from about 3,000 to 2,000. The number of beds has
fallen from 550,000 to 330,000.
In spite of the reduction in beds the number of in-patients treated in NHS
hospitals has reached a record 9.2m (compared with 3.8m in 1951). The
increase is largely due to a reduction in the average length of stay from 45
days to 11 days.
