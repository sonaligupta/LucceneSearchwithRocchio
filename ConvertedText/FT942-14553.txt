FT  20 APR 94 / Delay to milk market reform denied


   By ALISON MAITLAND


The reorganisation of the Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales is
still on course for November 1, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
said yesterday.
Mrs Shephard was responding to speculation that the planned liberalisation
might be delayed a second time because of fresh proposals from the dairy
trade to the revised reorganisation scheme put forward by the Milk Marketing
Board.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr David Naish, National Farmers' Union
president, she dismissed suggestions that it would be impossible to achieve
the timetable proposed by the board for turning itself into Milk Marque, a
voluntary farmers' co-operative.
However, a ministerial decision on the board's scheme, pencilled in for the
end of this month, is not now expected until the middle of May because of
the 'major' proposals from the Dairy Trade Feder-ation last week, an
official said.
The federation, which has consistently opposed aspects of the board's plans
as monopolistic, proposed a 'milk forum' under independent chairmanship to
set the prices at which Milk Marque would sell to dairy companies.
This was rejected by Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, who said
the federation appeared to be trying to delay the reorganisation and
re-create a buyers' cartel.
