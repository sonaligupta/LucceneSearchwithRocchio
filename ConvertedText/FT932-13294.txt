FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): What it costs
to take advice


HOW MUCH might you expect to pay for fee-based financial advice?
The Institute of Financial Planning says that the average charge per hour is
Pounds 80, but 30 per cent of fee-based advisers charge less than Pounds 70
an hour. In total, 66 per cent of fee-based advisers charge no more than
Pounds 100 an hour. Only 2.8 per cent charge more than Pounds 100 an hour.
VAT is payable on fees.
Usually, the first meeting will be free with both parties 'getting to know'
each other. If you decide to take your finances to the adviser, hourly
charges will come in, so it is important to ask how many hours work your
affairs are likely to take.
If you are leaving a portfolio in the hands of the adviser, you can expect
to be charged 1 per cent of the investment annually. Paying Pounds 2,000 on
a Pounds 200,000 investment may sound high but it gives the adviser an
incentive to make the investment grow.
Sometimes fee-charging advisers rebate commission to the client, when it
cannot be reinvested. Tax can be a problem, because commission is paid as an
income to the adviser who then has to pay income tax on it. The income tax
liability is then passed to the consumer.
Each adviser will have their own remuneration system, so ask them how they
structure their charges and the amount you might expect to pay before the
first meeting. Make sure that you do not end up paying fees and commission -
that is the worst of both worlds.
