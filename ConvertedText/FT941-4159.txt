FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Shut up' is not acceptable from a
guardian of free speech


   From Mr PHILIPPE LEGRAIN


Sir, With reference to your editorial 'Euro-babble' (March 3), I am
disappointed that a newspaper of your standing should stoop to telling the
European Union's culture and information commissioner to 'shut up'. Should a
guardian of free speech tell anyone to shut up, much less Mr Pinheiro whose
views - while different from your leader writer's - are respectable? It is
ironic that the same leader accuses Mr Pinheiro of 'an objectionable attempt
at censorship'.
On encouraging European audiovisual 'entertainment', you criticise Mr
Pinheiro's flawed proposals without suggesting alternatives. While
free-trade principles are important, films are not merely entertainment, but
also culture - and culture's value cannot be measured in purely economic
terms. If you insist on viewing it as a commodity like toothpaste, what
price do you assign to Shakespeare, national identity or freedom of
expression?
