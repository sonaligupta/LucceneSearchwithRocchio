FT  28 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Overseas losses serve to
drive Dow downward

Wall Street
LOSSES on overseas markets set the tone for early weakness in US equities
yesterday, and in spite of some broadly positive economic news, share prices
ended sharply lower amid talk that some big funds had switched from equities
into bonds, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 36.24 at 3,231.44.
The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 4.36 at
403.50, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks slumped 10.73
at 604.67. Turnover on the NYSE was 167m shares.
There was no particular trigger for the selling and the current perception
among investors and traders is that the market is in a period of transition.
Amid the uncertainty about the near-term outlook, trading remained cautious,
and there was talk that some big investors were making a short-term tactical
switch from stocks to bonds. The market ignored news of a 1.1 per cent rise
in personal income and a 0.9 per cent rise in personal spending last month.
Both figures were slightly higher than forecasts.
Technology issues bore the brunt of the selling. Digital Equipment fell
Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham, the broking
house, lowered an investment rating on the stock and increased its forecast
of how much the group will lose in 1992.
Hewlett-Packard slipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 , Unisys gave up
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 9 3/4 , Motorola, which announced plans to build a
factory in Beijing, China, dropped Dollars 3 to Dollars 75 3/8 , and IBM
fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 83 1/4 .
Household International slumped Dollars 9 1/4 to Dollars 46 3/4 in turnover
of 2.1m shares after the financial services and manufacturing group warned
that first quarter earnings would be 40 per cent to 50 per cent below
analysts' estimates. These have ranged between Dollars 1.10 and Dollars 1.35
a share.
Catalina Marketing enjoyed a successful debut. The issue of 2.2m shares of
common stock was priced at Dollars 20 a share, and at the close they were
trading at Dollars 28.
On the over-the-counter market, technology stocks also took a beating. Intel
was by far the most actively traded issue, dropping Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars
55 1/4 in turnover of 11.7m shares after Bear Stearns downgraded the stock
from a 'buy' to a 'hold'.
Also lower were Apple, Dollars 3 weaker at Dollars 61, Microsoft, down
Dollars 3 3/4 at Dollars 121 1/4 , and Borland International, Dollars 2 3/4
lower at Dollars 54.
Profits warnings affected Handex Environment, down Dollars 7 1/2 at Dollars
14, and Alias Research, down Dollars 2 at Dollars 11 1/2 . Both companies
said next quarter earnings would be lower than a year ago.

IN TORONTO, stock prices moved lower throughout the day, closing sharply
down in moderate trading. The composite index fell 31.73 points, or 0.92 per
cent, to close at 3416.78, with declining issues leading advances by 327 to
254. Volume was 27.770 shares, down from Thursday's 30.105 and trading value
fell to CDollars 239.5m from CDollars 297m. On the week, the index was off
about 23 points, or about 1.5 per cent. Thirteen of 14 stock groups lost
ground, led by the mining group, off 1.7 per cent.
