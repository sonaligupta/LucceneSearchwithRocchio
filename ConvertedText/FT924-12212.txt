FT  22 OCT 92 / World Trade News: UK wants action on airport slots


   By DANIEL GREEN


BRITAIN called on its European Community partners yesterday to allow more
airlines to compete for landing slots at crowded airports.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said Britain was using its EC
presidency to press the case for a regulation, binding on member states,
that should help new airlines to secure scarce landing slots at crowded
airports.
The draft requires, for example, independent slot co-ordinators to be
appointed at congested airports. At most airports in Europe, co-ordinators
are employees of an individual airline, usually the country's flag carrier.
Co-ordinators control the slot allocation which depends on so-called
'grandfather rights': an airline which operates a slot one year has right of
first refusal on the same slot the following year.
Mr MacGregor said that EC-backed decisions were needed 'if the full benefits
of the liberalisation of air transport are to be realised.'
Airports most affected by slot shortages are Heathrow, Frankfurt, Milan,
Gatwick, Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen and Charles de Gaulle.
