   By Our Beijing Correspondent


China and Canada yesterday signed an agreement in principle for the sale of
two Candu nuclear reactors worth about CDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.59bn) to be
built at Qinshan, south of Shanghai, next to an existing Chinese plant.
Canada would be responsible for CDollars 2bn financing of the reactor sale,
said Mr Bob Smith, president of Atomic Energy of Canada.
The Candu deal was part of a CDollars 8.6bn package of contracts and
memorandums of understanding signed yesterday in Beijing by Canadian
businessmen in the presence of Canada's prime minister Jean Chretien. Other
agreements involved telecommunications, power plants, building materials,
gold exploration, real estate and pipeline production.
