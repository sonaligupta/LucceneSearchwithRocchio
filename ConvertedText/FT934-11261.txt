FT  02 NOV 93 / Submissions for Channel 5 grow


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE Independent Television Commission has received 131 expressions of
interest in future options for a new Channel 5 in the UK.
The number compares with the 30 submissions sent in three years ago when the
ITC was first thinking of advertising a new national television channel. In
the end the ITC turned down the only resulting bid from a consortium led by
Thames Television, mainly on the grounds of insufficient investor
commitment. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the commission is obliged 'to do
all it can' to get such a channel off the ground.
Seventy-six of the most recent submissions dealt with the three main options
for Channel 5 - re-advertisement of the original licence, using the
frequencies for digital broadcasting and a more local city-based service
that would require new legislation.
The total included 24 submissions from community groups interested in more
local broadcasting in Scotland. The further 55 submissions were in response
to an earlier ITC consultation documention the future of digital television.
The ITC declined to break down the Channel 5 submissions into support for
the three options. 'We do not want to give any more information without
context,' it said.
Those who have expressed an interest in a re-advertised Channel 5 include
Lord Hollick's Meridian Television, Thames Television (part of the Pearson
group, which owns the Financial Times), FiveTV and Time Warner. Associated
Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard, is
believed to have won a contract for the first London-wide cable television
channel.
The channel will be carried on the London-interconnect system, which links
the main cable television franchises of London. The linking of the
franchises of six major cable television operators makes such a channel
viable for the first time.
