FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Small sugar surplus seen for
1992-3


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


THE GAP between world sugar production and consumption in 1992-93 is now
widely expected to be a deficit, but one London company has bucked the trend
with a forecast of a surplus, albeit of only 560,000 tonnes.
ED & F Man puts world production at 111.8m tonnes for 1992-93, and
consumption at 111.3m tonnes. However, production figures are calculated
according to each individual country's crop year, while consumption is
calculated between October and September.
Man's latest sugar market report notes that if production is worked out over
a uniform October-September season, a deficit of 313,000 tonnes emerges.
This is still much lower than last week's deficit estimates of 2.84m tonnes
from Czarnikow, another London trade house, and 1.61m tonnes from the
International Sugar Organisation.
Man points out that production estimates appear to be falling into line, but
'there is still much discrepancy surrounding the consumption numbers.' It
describes the market, which has soared on supply factors such as the falls
in Thai and Cuban production, as 'bereft of consumption news'. This has led
to resistance to any further upward price movement.
Nevertheless, Man believes the market in raw sugar is likely to remain
tight, especially as the emerging southern hemisphere crops for 1993-94 from
Australia, South Africa and Brazil have all been hit by drought.
