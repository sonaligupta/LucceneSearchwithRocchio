FT  02 JUL 92 / New firms fail to boost Cleveland


   By CHRIS TIGHE


RESEARCH into Cleveland's economy has questioned the effectiveness of the
'enterprise culture' promoted by the government during the 1980s.
The report, partly funded by the Department of Employment, says the number
of new businesses set up in the county in the 1980s increased almost
threefold compared with the previous decade, but total employment was no
greater because the companies were smaller.
It argues that quantity was substituted for quality, with employees per
business dropping from an average of 25.7 for those set up in the 1970s to
8.9 in the 1980s.
Of the 1980s start-ups, 26 per cent were hairdressers, car breakers or in
other garage activities. More of the entrepreneurs in the 1980s were forced
into business through unemployment: 44 per cent were jobless or about to be,
compared with 28 per cent in the 1970s.
The report, by Professor David Storey, Professor of Small and Medium
Enterprises at of Warwick University Business School, and research fellow Mr
Adam Strange, estimates that 3,081 non-retail businesses were started during
the 1980s in Cleveland, compared with 1,143 in the 1970s.
It classes the increased number of companies as an asset, but emphasises
there was a reduction in relocations, which tend to employ larger numbers
than start-ups.
The study, which compares the 1980s findings with previous research into new
1970s businesses in Cleveland, says positive 1980s trends included:
An increase from 11 per cent to 25 per cent in women entrepreneurs.
The apparent disappearance of bank lending prejudices against women and the
unemployed.
Fewer trading difficulties among new companies.
Greater use of advice from agencies and fewer snags with 'red tape' and
finding premises. It concludes that the new businesses of the 1980s,
although more numerous, are less likely to achieve substantial growth than
their 1970s predecessors.
'If significant wealth is to be created in Cleveland, through 'the
enterprise culture', role models of successful firms need to be created,'
the report says. 'Judging from the results of this survey, these role models
barely exist.'
