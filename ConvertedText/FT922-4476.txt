FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Placing values Vega at Pounds 17.2m


   By DANIEL GREEN


ONE OF the smallest stock market flotations of the year was completed
successfully yesterday with a placing of shares in Vega Group, a space
industry consultancy.
A history of strong growth allowed the shares to be placed at 122p, a p/e
ratio of 18.35 on notional earnings per share for the year to March 31 1992
of 6.65p.
Turnover increased from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 6.3m between 1988 and 1992,
with pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 286,000 to Pounds 1.4m over the same
period.
At the placing price the company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds
17.2m with an estimated gross dividend yield of 2.5 per cent.
Dealings in the shares are due to begin on June 11.
The sponsor, Beeson Gregory, placed 4.37m shares - 31 per cent - with
institutional and private investors to raise Pounds 5.33m for existing
shareholders. No new money goes to the company which said the placing was
more than three times oversubscribed.
Directors said that a public quotation would help the company secure new
orders and would improve staff incent-ives.
Directors will keep 42.8 per cent of the share capital and have undertaken
not to sell any shares until after the publication of the 1993 results.
More than half the employees will hold a further 6.3 per cent.
The company was started in 1978, with Mr John Rigg, chairman, and Mr Chris
Duckworth, finance director, joining in 1989.
It is organised into four divisions: operations engineering, software,
systems engineering and dynamics and control. There are 122 staff, of which
107 are technical. Their work is in software and systems for ground services
and in-orbit operations.
Its biggest customer is the European Space Agency, which has a budget of
Pounds 2bn a year to build and launch non-defence satellites.
Contracts usually last for the life of a satellite, about 10 years. The
company has an order book of 'over Pounds 16.7m'.
Vega has just secured a Pounds 1m Ministry of Defence contract in the area
of battlefield command and control and said there could be further expansion
outside the space industry.
