FT  04 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fierce competition hits Thai
cement producer

SIAM Cement (SCC), Thailand's largest cement producer, blames fierce
competition and aggressive depreciation of its new plant for a 41 per cent
fall in first-half net profits.
Group net profit tumbled to Bt1.55bn (Dollars 61.6m) in the six months from
Bt2.62bn in the same period last year.
Sales rose to Bt20.8bn from Bt17.03bn.
Analysts said the profits had been hit by foreign exchange losses, the cost
of increased dealer discounts and promotions and rapid depreciation of new
plant, including an estimated Bt500m charge for the new Khao Wong cement
plant.
SCC said consolidated results were affected by the cost of establishing new
companies in the group such as Siam Guardian Glass and Tilecera.
However, second-quarter consolidated earnings rose 23 per cent to Bt856m
over the first quarter, while unconsolidated earnings rose 55 per cent to
Bt926m over the quarter, suggesting some recovery from a low point earlier
this year.
'I'm becoming less pessimistic than I was six months ago about the
possibility of a major price war,' said Mr George Morgan, country manager
for HG Asia in Thailand, 'and becoming more bullish on SCC as a result.'
