FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Japanese steel group names new
president


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


NKK, the Japanese steelmaker and one of the world's top five producers, will
appoint Mr Shunkichi Miyoshi to replace Mr Yoshinari Yamashiro as president,
Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Miyoshi is currently NKK's vice-president in charge of technical issues.
Mr Yamashiro will become chairman.
The change will take effect after it is approved at a shareholders' meeting
in late June.
NKK said the change was aimed at strengthening management because NKK had to
develop new business areas, such as electronics, and rationalise old areas
when the economy was slow and difficult.
