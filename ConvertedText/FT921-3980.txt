FT  11 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: PSBR forecast rekindles fears over gilts
issuance

   LONDON, NEW YORK


UK GOVERNMENT bonds dropped sharply on Mr Norman Lamont's Budget statement,
which forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 28bn. The
forecast was well above market expectations, and rekindled worries about the
level of new issuance in the gilts market next year.
Gilts started the day on a strong note, helped by the firm US Treasury bond
market overnight. The market's strength allowed the Bank of England to sell
over Pounds 300m of the tap issues which it announced on Monday.
Three tranches were sold out: Pounds 100m of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock
due 1994; Pounds 100m of 9 3/4 per cent Exchequer stock due 1998; and Pounds
100m of 9 1/2 per cent Conversion stock due 2005. The Bank also sold some of
the Pounds 200m tranche of 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000.
However, the gilt market's gains were overturned by the Budget announcement
in the afternoon. Mr Lamont's forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 14bn for the
current financial year was higher than the expected figure of Pounds 12bn,
and his forecast of a PSBR of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93 was between Pounds 2bn
and Pounds 4bn higher than many City of London economists had predicted.
Traders warned that a PSBR of Pounds 28bn would mean gross gilts issuance of
about Pounds 35bn, or just under Pounds 3bn in gilts issuance a month in
1992-93, compared with an average of Pounds 1.3bn in the current tax year.
The Bank of England announced yesterday that in future it would increase the
size of its regular gilt auctions to Pounds 2bn-Pounds 3bn every other
month. In the past, it has issued between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn at
auction.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003-07 opened at 114 25/32 and
traded down to 114 1/8 by late afternoon. Among shorter-dated issues, the 10
per cent gilt due 1994 slipped from 100 3/4 to 100 as traders said prospects
for an early cut in interest rates had evaporated due to sterling's
weakness.
US TREASURY bonds drifted lower yesterday afternoon in exceptionally light
trading as the market continued to wait for the economic data scheduled for
release at the end of the week.
Although bargain-hunting helped bonds move sharply higher late on Monday,
the momentum failed to carry through to morning trading. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond edged  3/32 higher at mid-session but by late trading
had fallen  7/32 to 101 3/16 to yield 7.89 per cent. Shorter-dated
maturities posted slimmer losses.
The Federal Reserve refrained from entering the open market yesterday. Fed
Funds were changing hands at 3 7/8 per cent during the Fed's usual
intervention period.
Investors are expected to remain on the sidelines for a few more days ahead
of the release of a number of economic reports including retail sales, car
sales and chain store sales on Thursday and Friday.
On Friday, the US producer price index for February will be released.
Players expect the index to rise by 0.2 per cent.
JAPANESE government bonds generally ended on a firmer note in the cash and
futures markets yesterday. However, traders said the benchmark No 129
underperformed the market as bondholders switched out of the issue to buy
the World Bank's new global yen bond.
The yield on the No 129 traded in a range of 5.40 per cent to 5.445 per cent
in Tokyo, and ended at 5.41 per cent, little changed on its opening level of
5.415 per cent.
Meanwhile, the June futures contract rose from its opening level of 102.32
to close at 102.40, the high of the day.
Dealers said the market was waiting for a cut in the Official Discount Rate
towards the end of this week or next.
THE GERMAN government bond market drifted back to close slightly lower in
light trading.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.55 and reached a high of 88.64
before closing at 88.49.
Only about 24,000 contracts were traded, well below average. Dealers said
the market was waiting for further developments on the wage front to give it
a clear direction.
Kokusai Securities, a mid-sized Japanese securities house, announced Tuesday
that it will close one branch and three sales offices to reduce costs.
The branch and one of the sales offices are located in Kobe, while the two
other sales offices are in Tokyo and Hokkaido.
Operations in Kobe will cease Friday, those in Tokyo end on March 23 and in
Hokkaido on April 19.
