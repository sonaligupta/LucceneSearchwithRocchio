FT  13 MAR 92 / Manchester airport set to lead tour market


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


MANCHESTER airport said yesterday it expected to overhaul London's Gatwick
this year as market leader in holiday charter traffic.
The airport says expanded summer programmes by more than 270 tour operators
will push Manchester's share of the UK inclusive tour booking market to
nearly 30 per cent, with an estimated 28 per cent for Gatwick.
Its scheduled services also continue to expand. In the year to February
Manchester handled a record number of passengers - more than 11.1m. Holiday
charter traffic accounts for about half of passenger throughput.
The airport yesterday announced new scheduled services to Prague, Istanbul
and Bangkok, bringing the number of scheduled airlines using the airport to
99, serving 165 destinations. This compares with 38 airlines and 72
destinations 10 years ago.
Growth in demand has led charter operators - principally Britannia, Air
2000, Caledonian and Excalibur - to base more or bigger aircraft at
Manchester this year, with a noticeable rise in long-haul traffic to the US,
the Caribbean and Africa. Bookings for popular destinations in Spain and
Cyprus have also risen.
On the scheduled side, American Airlines is to double its Chicago service to
two flights a day in the summer, while Air Canada and Canadian Airlines will
each increase their Toronto service from four flights a week to 10. There
will also be extra flights to European destinations.
Manchester expects to open the first phase of its second terminal in a year.
Terminal 2 will cost Pounds 570m, with the first phase costing Pounds 265m.
BAA, the airports operator, said its eight airports handled 4.8m passengers
last month, a 33 per cent rise on February last year, when numbers were
badly affected by the Gulf War, and 3.4 per cent above the February 1990
total.
