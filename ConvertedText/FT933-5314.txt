FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


EARLY strength in stock index futures that was underpinned by heavy demand
for drug issues faded as dealers turned to focus on the weakening gilts
sector, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened in line with the previous day's close at 3,093, the September
contract on the FT-SE 100 moved steadily forward, with the market as a whole
supported by the demand in the pharmaceuticals. The session's high of 3,102
was reached around 9.30am, after which the contract drifted gently lower.
The downward direction gathered pace as the mood in UK bonds turned
negative, as did that in short sterling.
Further weakness in the afternoon saw September ease to the day's low of
3,081 before steadying to finish at 3,086.
A significant amount of basket trading was reported, most of it early in the
session, and for most of the time the contract traded in a range of 3,085 to
3,095. Volume at the close was 8,496 contracts in September and 1,641 lots
in the December contract.
A large single deal in the Euro FT-SE 100 in the traded options, together
with heavy dealings in Glaxo options, boosted total turnover to 38,684 lots,
against a previous 21,661. Volume in the Euro FT-SE contract was 9,565 lots
and that in the FT-SE 100 option 9,409. Among stock options, strong demand
in the pharmaceuticals saw 6,260 contracts dealt in Glaxo.
