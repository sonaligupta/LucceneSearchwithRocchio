FT  27 MAY 93 / Observer: Loaded down


A survey just published in Hong Kong seems to rebut the celebrated riposte
of philosopher C E M Joad when asked if a good man could be happy on the
rack: 'Yes - provided he is the saintliest of men, and it is the lousiest of
racks.'
The Asia-wide study by the Survey Research consultancy found that the
happiest nations were impoverished Indonesia and the Philippines, with 94
per cent of people questioned pronouncing themselves happy in each case. The
most depressed, on the other hand, were the rich Japanese a full 30 points
lower on the scale.
The survey firm summed up the findings with a Chinese proverb saying that,
while the contented can make light of poverty, the discontented will remain
so no matter how rich they be.
To which the Japanese might reply: 'But at least they can be miserable in
comfort.'
