FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Headway cuts deficit to Pounds 0.6m in
unseasonal half


Headway, the consumer and industrial goods manufacturer, reported reduced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 628,000 for the six months ended December 31. The
comparable deficit was Pounds 883,000.
Historically, the group budgets for a loss in the first half because sales
by its dominant garden furniture subsidiary, Aronstead, are heavily biased
towards the final quarter.
All businesses other than Aronstead operated profitably in the first half,
the company said.
Turnover for the six months was 11.6 per cent higher at Pounds 11.2m and at
the operating level the deficit was reduced from Pounds 624,000 to Pounds
397,000.
Mr Andrew Staniland, chairman, said significant improvements had been made
to factory efficiencies in key areas, while working capital and borrowings
had both been kept under tight control. Gearing was reduced to 27.5 per cent
(34.9 per cent).
Reorganisation costs in continuing operations grew slightly to Pounds
130,000 (Pounds 103,000) but this was offset by a fall in net interest
payable to Pounds 101,000 (Pounds 156,000).
Losses per share emerged at 2.6p (3.7p).
In November the group acquired the Stansted Furniture Company, a
manufacturer of flatpack wooden furniture.
It is also to expand its Europa Sofabeds subsidiary by building a new
factory. The existing freehold properties have been sold for Pounds 440,000
 -in line with net book value.
