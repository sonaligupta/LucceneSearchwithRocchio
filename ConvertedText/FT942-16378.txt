FT  11 APR 94 / People: Passing the baton at New York Times


   By JUREK MARTIN


Though it is a leading institution in the biggest city in the US, deep in
its heart the New York Times has always considered itself a reporters'
paper, writes Jurek Martin.
That tradition should be preserved with the passing of the executive
editor's baton from Max Frankel, in charge for the past eight years, to his
deputy Joe Lelyveld, one of its greatest foreign correspondents, and with
Lelyveld's intriguing recruitment of a new number two.
This is Eugene Roberts, an old Times-man who left to take the Philadelphia
Inquirer to new heights for 18 years (and 17 Pulitzer prizes) before
retiring to the gentler climes of Maryland University.
At 61, Roberts will not, barring accidents, succeed Lelyveld, 57, because of
the newspaper's mandatory retirement at 65. This implies some jockeying for
position among junior ranks in the years ahead, with early money on Howell
Raines, editorial page editor, and Gerald Boyd, now assistant managing
editor and the paper's senior black journalist.
Lelyveld and Roberts are a team of contrasts. The former is austere and
quite shy. Though he reported from London, New Delhi and Hong Kong and
served two glittering terms in South Africa, it is hard to imagine him
wearing a safari jacket.
Roberts, on the other hand, is the quintessential green eye-shade editor, a
throw back to the old-fashioned hard news days now under threat from the
proliferation of life-style pages that have even made their mark on the
Times.
Lelyveld, the son of a rabbi, has been groomed for the top for the past four
years and only the timing of his elevation comes as a small surprise. Not
that Max Frankel, 64, is retiring. Like his illustrious predecessor, Abe
Rosenthal, he is ascending into Times heaven as a regular columnist.
