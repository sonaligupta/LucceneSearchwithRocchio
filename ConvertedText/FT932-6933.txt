FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Bellwinch makes Pounds 6.5m placing to fund
growth


BELLWINCH, the Wembley-based builder, is calling for Pounds 6.5m via a fully
underwritten placing and open offer of 27.4m new ordinary shares.
The money raised will be used to replenish the group's land bank and to fund
its working capital requirements in developing new sites with the object of
'progressively increasing the level of annual sales.'
The shares are being placed with Credit Lyonnais Laing and are subject to a
clawback by qualifying shareholders on a 5-for-3 basis at 25p per share.
Credit Lyonnais Laing does not intend to apply for its entitlement under the
open offer and is placing its existing holding of 494,262 ordinary shares,
acquired in December 1991 at the time of the group's financial
reconstruction, with an institutional investor at 25p each.
On current trading, Bellwinch directors said that since the middle of
January the market in house sales had improved, benefiting from low mortgage
rates and a ratio of house prices to earnings lower than had been
experienced since the 1960s.
They believed that public confidence had begun to increase and that
stability would return to the market place for housing during 1993, with
some small increases in selling prices during the second half.
