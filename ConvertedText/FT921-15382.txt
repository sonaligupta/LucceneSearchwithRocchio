FT  10 JAN 92 / Cresson unveils jobs package


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and IAN DAVIDSON

FRANCE'S embattled Socialist government yesterday launched a jobs package in
the hope of stemming rising unemployment before it reaches the politically
damaging level of 3m.
Unemployment has risen steadily since 1990 to a record 2.8m, or 9.8 per cent
of the workforce. It has become the overriding issue in the run-up to the
regional poll in March and general elections next year.
The measures are aimed at long term unemployed - mainly the young and the
over 50s - which represent nearly a third of the total. They will offer
18-month subsidised training schemes for young people who have been out of
work for more than six months and cannot get an apprenticeship.
A poor outlook for the French economy this year adds to the pressure on the
government to be seen to be taking action.
This is the third round of job-creation proposals since Mrs Edith Cresson
became as prime minister last May. Unions and employers yesterday gave a
cool reception.
Mr Marc Blondel, general secretary of the Fource Ouvriere union, said the
plans were 'muddle headed.'
