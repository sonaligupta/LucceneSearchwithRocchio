FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Divisions among Maxwell pension fund
managers


   By BRONWEN MADDOX


LEADING City houses which managed some of the Maxwell companies' pension
funds were divided last night on their ability to say whether the
investments were still intact.
Imro, the investment industry watchdog, is attempting to find out whether
the Maxwell pension funds managed by independent City bodies have been
preserved.
One obstacle facing accountants and regulators who are trying to trace
hundreds of millions of pounds plundered from the Maxwell companies' pension
funds is that the location of some of the share certificates is unclear.
Most of the missing money was in the Common Investment Fund, a pooled fund
of around Pounds 700m - most of the Maxwell pension money - which was
managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management, a Maxwell-controlled company.
Much of its investments were taken to prop up Mr Maxwell's tottering private
companies.
Accountants and regulators are now turning their attention to the
investments that remained outside the CIF, managed by independent City
advisers.
Most of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension money not in the CIF was managed
by MIM, Lloyds Investment Management, Capel Cure Myers and Lazard Freres
Investment Management.
Legal & General and Scottish Amicable looked after a small part of the AGB
and Maxwell Communication Corporation funds.
A spokesman for Travis Smith Braithwaite, the solicitors acting for the
trustees of the Mirror Group Pension Fund, said that 'more than half' of the
investments managed outside the CIF remained in place and that it was
continuing to search for the balance.
Travis Smith declined to comment on which assets had been traced so far, and
Imro declined to comment on individual members.
