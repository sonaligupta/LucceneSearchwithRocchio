FT  15 APR 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Two checkouts for the price of
one


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Supermarkets which want to speed up the movement of customers through the
checkouts, and cut costs into the bargain, are being offered an automatic
scanning system which enables one operator to serve two customers
simultaneously without an increase in shoplifting.
The systems, developed by Potrafke, of Hattingen, Germany, consist of two
parallel conveyor lanes with a cashier seated in between. The customer
places the goods on the belt and they pass through a perspex covered tunnel
where they are scanned. A carousel, synchronised to the conveyor, then
carries away the goods so that the shopper can pack them while the next
customer is using the conveyor.
