FT  21 JUL 94 / Manila agrees Dollars 469m debt deal

The Philippines has concluded an agreement for the rescheduling of Dollars
469m (Pounds 308m) worth of debts from its Paris Club of official creditors,
the government announced yesterday.
The rescheduling, agreed in Paris, follows the approval on June 24 by the
International Monetary Fund of a Dollars 685m credit package to support the
country's growth-oriented economic programme for the period to June 1997.
It also precedes a meeting today, also in Paris, of the consultative group
that co-ordinates a World Bank-led multilateral assistance programme for the
Philippines.
Pledges of some Dollars 2bn concessional loans and grants are expected at
the meeting.
With these financial packages, the Philippines now stands 'on the threshold
of a full and dramatic recovery,' Mr Roberto de Ocampo, the finance
secretary, said.
The rescheduling, Mr de Ocampo said, supports 'the soft-landing approach to
the country's exit from exceptional financing. . .to achieve growth
consistent with sustainable external accounts primarily supported by
voluntary flows.'
The economy grew by 4.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year, a big
jump from 0.3 per cent in the same period last year.
This has led to expectations that the 4.5 per cent growth targeted for the
full-year will be exceeded.
