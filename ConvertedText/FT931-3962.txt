FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: US Pru may sell reinsurance arm


   By NIKKI TAIT


THE PRUDENTIAL Insurance Company of America, the nation's largest insurer,
announced yesterday that it was 'evaluating strategic alternatives' for its
reinsurance subsidiary, Prudential Reinsurance Company - possibly paving the
way for its disposal.
The Pru, which is not related to the British company with the same name, did
not spell out precisely what alternatives it had in mind. However, Mr Robert
Winters, chairman, said it was 'looking to maximise the value' of its
reinsurance subsidiary and did not regard reinsurance as a 'core business'.
'Given current investor interest in the reinsurance sector,' he said, 'we
feel that now is an opportune time to explore alternatives with respect to
the future of Prudential Re.' Financial advisers have been retained to
review the situation.
However, Mr Winters also said the Pru was prepared to retain 100 per cent
ownership of Prudential Re 'if we find that is the best way to optimise its
worth to the Prudential'.
Prudential Re, with its headquarters in Newark, is the fifth largest
reinsurance operation in the US with assets of about Dollars 3.1bn.
The Prudential, which was badly hit by losses from Hurricane Andrew last
year, would not be the first insurer to shed reinsurance operations
recently; last year, Hartford-based Aetna sold Aetna Re-Insurance to a
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts buy-out for Dollars 1.4bn.
