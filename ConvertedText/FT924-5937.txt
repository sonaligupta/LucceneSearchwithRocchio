FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Diploma shares jump 22p on 14% gain to
Pounds 16.6m


   By PETER PEARSE


SHARES IN Diploma rose 22p to 344p yesterday as the electronics, building
components and special steels group announced a 14 per cent profits increase
from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 16.6m pre-tax for the year to September 30.
This rise was achieved in spite of a Pounds 9.6m decline in turnover to
Pounds 132.3m, though Mr Christopher Thomas, chairman, pointed out that the
comparable figures contained turnover of Pounds 20.5m and profits of Pounds
500,000 from ECS and Access, no longer with the group. There was an
extraordinary debit of Pounds 3.4m (credit Pounds 4.4m)
Interest receivable rose by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.1m.
In electronics, profits grew to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 6.2m) on turnover shrunk
to Pounds 77.8m (Pounds 83m). The best performer was Macro, the active
components distributor, which lifted turnover by 16 per cent to Pounds 45m
against 'a fairly flat market' where prices fell by a further 12 per cent.
The building components division, where profits only fell by Pounds 200,000
to Pounds 6m on reduced turnover at Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 45.2m), was largely
carried by IG Lintels. Mr Thomas said that in three years, it had lifted its
market share from 25 to 37 per cent.
The steels side was hit by uncertainty in the oil sector and general low
investment in capital goods. Turnover fell from Pounds 13.7m to 11.1m and
profits from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 700,000.
A final dividend of 7p (6.5p) is recommended, making a total of 9.75p
(8.75p), payable from earnings of 19.4p (17.3p) per share.
COMMENT
With sound and, more importantly, motivated management the key to success,
Diploma has again proved growth is possible whatever the circumstances. A
cash pile almost unchanged at Pounds 26.3m, after spending Pounds 7.7m
buying Anachem, a liquid chemical analysis systems distributor, gives Mr
Thomas leeway to buoy up the smaller companies in the current economic
storm. The stars were Macro and IG. The former's ability, through new
products and an emphasis on service, to squeeze more from mature markets was
impressive. Full-year pre-tax profits forecast range from Pounds 18.5m to
Pounds 19.5m, giving a p/e of 15 to 15.9. The shares are fully valued, not
likely to get cheaper, but a long-term stock.
