FT  15 APR 94 / German parliament relaxes labour law


   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN

The German parliament yesterday approved a long-awaited series of measures
to relax labour market regulations and encourage job creation, thereby
reducing Germany's jobless figures, which recently reached a post-war high.
The law will allow private employment agencies to enter a market which has
until now been run exclusively by a state-owned agency. It will also
encourage part-time working, a measure vigorously resisted by Germany's
trade unions.
Unemployed people will be encouraged to do paid work to help the community
without losing their benefits, and to take on more seasonal work.
The Social Democratic party and other left-wing opposition parties said the
law would not create new jobs but would whittle away workers' benefits.
Unemployment reached 4.03m in January, a post-war high. There have been
forecasts that the number of jobless could rise to 4.5m this year.
The official east German unemployment rate is 17 per cent, although German
figures do not include people on job creation schemes, short-time work or
early retirement.
With a general election in October, Chancellor Helmut Kohl hopes the new law
and subsequent measures will counter suggestions the government is doing
nothing.
However, it is unlikely the new legislation will bring any immediate relief
to the unemployed. Analysts say the present high unemployment rate has
little to do with a cyclical downturn in the economy and more with
over-manning and excessive wages.
Mr Norbert Blum, employment minister, said the government had created 3m
jobs in the last 10 years and that unemployment was still high in part
because a further 2.6m people had entered the labour market.
