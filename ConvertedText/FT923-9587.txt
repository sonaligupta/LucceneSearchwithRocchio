FT  04 AUG 92 / Belgian budget comes under fire


   By ANDREW HILL


The Belgian government yesterday unveiled a surprisingly soft budget for
1993, which was sharply criticised by economists and market analysts, Andrew
Hill writes.
The measures should reduce the budget deficit from an estimated 5.7 per cent
of GNP in 1992 to 5.2 per cent next year. The target is to reduce the
deficit to 3 per cent of GNP by 1996, one of the criteria for European
economic and monetary union (Emu).
Analysts were unhappy that Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister,
had not persuaded cabinet colleagues to push for a more drastic reduction in
the deficit to 4.9 per cent of GNP in 1993.
