FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bridon sells eight units


   By TIM BURT


Bridon, the wire rope and engineering products manufacturer, stepped up its
wide-ranging restructuring programme yesterday with the disposal of eight
subsidiaries.
The lossmaking group said it was selling its engineering companies to Vector
Industries, a private company backed by 3i venture capital, for Pounds 13m
in cash.
The move follows a group shake-up, announced in February, aimed at
streamlining production.
Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive, said the disposals were identified in a
lengthy internal review - codenamed Project 360 - which recommended reducing
the emphasis on peripheral activities.
Proceeds from the disposal will be used to reduce the group's net borrowing,
which totalled Pounds 11.8m in the year to December 31.
