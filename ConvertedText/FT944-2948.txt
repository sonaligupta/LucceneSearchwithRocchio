FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Crockfords expands with Pounds 18m casino
buy


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Crockfords, the casino company that was reversed into TV-am last year,
yesterday bought the International Sporting Club from Brent Walker for
Pounds 18m cash.
The International Sporting Club in Mayfair is pitched at the middle of the
market, and will be Crockfords' second premises. There are just 21 casinos
in London, and acquisition is the only practical way an operator can expand
in the business.
Crockfords opened London's first legal casino in Curzon Street in 1961. Last
August the company reversed into TV-am, which had lost its licence and was
planning a voluntary liquidation.
Mr Gary Nesbitt, chairman, bought Crockfords from Brent Walker in 1990, and
has turned it from a casino where players were betting Pounds 2 at a time to
the sort of establishment where players can lose Pounds 1m in a single
night.
He said earlier this year that his strategy would be to continue to develop
the existing club and to look out for acquisitions in London.
Brent Walker has owned the International Sporting Club since 1987. It has
been operating from its existing premises, which are undergoing
refurbishment, since 1990.
In 1993 the casino made an operating profit of Pounds 1.6m on turnover of
Pounds 9.8m.
Crockfords is meeting the consideration from existing resources. It is
acquiring a new 25-year lease on the premises.
