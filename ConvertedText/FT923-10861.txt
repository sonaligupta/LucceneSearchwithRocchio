FT  28 JUL 92 / Postal payments


ROYAL MAIL is paying Pounds 5.8m compensation annually to its customers for
faulty postal deliveries, a report disclosed yesterday. The Post Office
Users' National Council said the figure could be higher if more people knew
how to claim for mail which is lost, damaged, late or delivered to the wrong
address.
