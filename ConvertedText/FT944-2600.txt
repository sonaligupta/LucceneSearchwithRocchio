FT  16 DEC 94 / Spain to revive Gibraltar leaseback idea

   MADRID, LONDON


Spain is planning to resurrect suggestions for a leaseback of Gibraltar, or
a sharing of sovereignty, that were raised 10 years ago at the first annual
bilateral meeting to discuss the future of the British colony.
Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, will tell British
negotiators on Tuesday in London 'imaginative steps' are needed to end a
diplomatic deadlock and avert a 'mafia-type' takeover of the colony.
One Spanish proposal is that Gibraltar should be leased to Britain for an
unspecified number of years. Another is that London and Madrid would, for a
period, share sovereignty. Under either formula, territorial sovereignty
over Gibraltar would eventually be restored to Spain, though its
institutions and identity would be safeguarded by self-rule powers
negotiated between London and Madrid.
The UK has difficulties with the leaseback suggestion because the British
government is committed to Gibraltar's 1969 constitution. This guarantees
that the UK will not cede the colony to Spain against the wishes of the
majority of its population.
Spain is concerned that Gibraltar's economy, which was once dependent on the
UK's Ministry of Defence, relies increasingly on money laundering and
cigarette and drug smuggling.
Mr Solana will seek firm assurances from Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, that illicit activities on the Rock will cease.
Spanish diplomatic protests about Gibraltar's alleged illegal economic
activity have increased in recent months, and Madrid has stepped up border
controls between Spain and the colony.
Madrid officials say the border controls are helping them build up a data
base on money laundering and smuggling.
Spanish police patrols on beaches close to Gibraltar seized three hauls of
hashish weighing a total of 350 kilos last week.
