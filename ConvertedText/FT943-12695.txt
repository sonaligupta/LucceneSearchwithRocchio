FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Subsidies would create opportunities
for apprentices


   From Mr ALASDAIR MACCONACHIE


Sir, As a motor retailer and a private company, employing 75 technicians in
our after-sales activity, I feel very strongly that if the government or
Training and Enterprise Councils were to put more resources behind the
training of apprentices, there would be a great opportunity for training
youngsters.
The motor trader apprentice scheme is regarded as one of the best available.
Many of us, however, cannot afford to invest as much as we would like in the
development of young technicians.
If there were a reasonable subsidy behind apprentice training I am sure you
would see significant numbers of school leavers being given an excellent
opportunity.
