FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Profits take off at Paris's key
airports

AEROPORTS de Paris (ADP), the company which runs the Charles de Gaulle and
Orly airports, saw net profits rise by 46.4 per cent to FFr558m (Dollars
102m) in 1992, from FFr381m in 1991.
The group benefited last year from healthy growth in the number of
passengers, compared with 1991, when both business and leisure traffic was
badly affected by the Gulf war.
The number of passengers rose 13.6 per cent to 50.4m in 1992. The number of
commercial flights rose by 7.4 per cent to 496,000 and the volume of freight
increased at the same rate to 980,000 tonnes.
This fuelled a 13.6 per cent increase in Aeroports de Paris' sales to
FFr6.1bn last year. The group forecasts further growth of 7 per cent this
year.
