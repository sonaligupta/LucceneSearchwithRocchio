FT  10 JAN 92 / Labour strategy on council tax


LABOUR PEERS are to attempt to make the council tax, which the government
plans to introduce as a replacement for the poll tax in April 1993, more
closely related to ability to pay.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour spokesman on local government in the
Lords, warned ministers last night to expect 'many, many amendments' to the
Local Government Finance Bill.
