FT  19 APR 94 / People: Harrison builds on his career at Tarmac


Roy Harrison, 46, has been appointed chief executive of Tarmac's housing
division, Britain's biggest housebuilder. He will take over from Sam
Pickstock who reaches 60 in August, the normal retirement age for Tarmac
directors.
Harrison, who joined Tarmac in 1971, was previously managing director of
Tarmac's building materials division. He replaces the man who was the
architect of Tarmac's rapid growth as a housebuilder during the 1980s.
The housing division, however, was strongly criticised when it failed to
react early enough to the collapse of the UK housing market. The company
continued to buy expensive housing land when prices of homes were starting
to fall. As a result, Tarmac was required to make substantial provisions
against its housing operations, but, along with other UK housebuilders, the
division is currently enjoying a resurgence.
Harrison will be replaced as managing director of the building materials
division by Anthony Hopkins, until recently vice president Tarmac America,
responsible for the group's Florida operations. John Carr, formerly md of
Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, has been appointed ceo of Tarmac America.
