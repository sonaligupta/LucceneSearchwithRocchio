FT  27 OCT 92 / Stempel bows to pressure and resigns as GM chief


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


MR ROBERT Stempel resigned yesterday as chairman of crisis-stricken General
Motors, bowing to pressure from fellow directors who accused him of not
moving forcefully enough to shake up the company's loss-making North
American car operations.
Mr Stempel, 59, who only became chairman in August 1990, is the first chief
executive of the world's largest manufacturing company to be ousted since Mr
William Crapo Durant, founder of GM, was forced out in 1920.
He is expected to be succeeded as chairman, on an interim basis, by Mr John
Smale, who led a boardroom coup last April by non-executive directors
concerned at the slowness of GM's revamp. Mr Smale, 65, is a former chairman
of Procter & Gamble, the consumer products group.
Mr Stempel made no reference to any direct boardroom pressures yesterday in
his resignation statement. He said merely that he could 'not in good
conscience continue to watch the effect of rumours and speculation that have
undermined and slowed the efforts of General Motors people to make this a
stronger, more efficient, effective organisation'.
He hoped his resignation would end the 'chaos of the past several weeks'.
In April Mr Smale replaced Mr Stempel as head of the board's executive
committee, while Mr Lloyd Reuss, group president and head of North America,
was replaced by Mr Jack Smith, previously responsible for GM's international
operations.
Mr Smale, acting on behalf of the GM board, said Mr Stempel had been asked
to continue as chairman until a successor was named.
GM shares, which have risen sharply since rumours of Mr Stempel's
resignation began to circulate last week, rose Dollars  3/4 to close at
Dollars 34 1/4 in New York.
