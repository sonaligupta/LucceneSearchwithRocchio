FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow gains from late bond
price rally


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
After a mixed morning, the US stock market ended a fractious week firmly
higher, thanks primarily to a late rally in bond prices, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 32.08 at 3,862.70, its
high for the day. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 2.54
at 466.44, while the American Stock Exchange finished up 1.20 at 465.98.
The Nasdaq composite fared less well, and closed only 0.11 higher at 789.20.
Trading volume was 303m shares.
After Thursday's frenetic trading in bonds and stocks, much of it prompted
by unsubstantiated rumours concerning the White House and the Whitewater
affair, some semblance of calm returned to financial markets yesterday.
Share prices, however, opened lower after an early rally in the bond market
had fizzled out. That rally in bonds had been inspired by a February retail
sales report. Although the figures showed a bigger than expected increase of
1.5 per cent in February sales, bond market investors and traders chose to
concentrate instead on a surprise, and sharp, downward revision in the
January data. If the two months were taken together, analysts said, sales
were essentially flat in early 1994, which was good news for
inflation-sensitive bonds.
Yet the bond market could not hold on to its early gains, which disturbed
equity investors. Consequently, stocks fell across the board in the first
hour of trading.
However, the market later rallied convincingly off its lows, and again it
was bond prices which provided the lead. Bonds, having fallen to opening
values mid-morning, revived later, and by late afternoon the benchmark
30-year government bond was up three quarters of a point, and the yield was
down to 6.909 per cent.
The rally inspired the stock market, and aided by short-covering, blue-chip
stocks steadily recovered during a busy afternoon of buying.
Among individual issues, Grumman jumped Dollars 9 7/8 to Dollars 64 3/4 in
volume of 2m shares after a second rival defence group, Northrop, offered to
buy the company. Northrop's offer of Dollars 60 a share tops an earlier,
agreed, bid from Martin Marrietta worth Dollars 55 a share.
The rise in Grumman's stock yesterday implies that the market expects the
bidding war to escalate well beyond Dollars 60 a share. The news left
Northrop up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 41 3/8 and Martin Marrietta off Dollars
2 at Dollars 44 1/2 .
Unisys climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 15 3/4 , lifted by news of a Dollars
127m banking automation contract awarded to the company and a ratings
upgrade from brokerage house Lehman Brothers.
International Paper, hit earlier in the week by a profits warning, rebounded
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 after Paine Webber upgraded its rating on the
stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'.
Canada
Toronto shares ended little changed in active trading.
The composite index was up 3.68 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4446.86, for a
gain on the week of about 48 points.
In Friday's trading, declines led advances by 376 to 371, volume of 94.959
shares was below Thursday's 100.444 shares, and trading value fell to
CDollars 823m from CDollars 917.5m.
Most gains were limited. Industrial products gained 0.61 per cent, consumer
products and energy were flat, and mining, financial services, and golds
were down slightly.
