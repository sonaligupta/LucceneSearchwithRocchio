FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: GM denies Stempel reports


   By MARTIN DICKSON


GENERAL Motors, the struggling US automobile manufacturer, yesterday added a
new problem to its list of woes - fighting rumours that its non-executive
directors are pressing for Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, to step down.
The company has strongly denied the reports, which surfaced in their
strongest form yet on the front page of yesterday's Washington Post
newspaper.
This quoted unnamed board sources as saying that the directors had grown
increasingly unhappy with Mr Stempel's performance, but were still debating
who should replace him.
Mr Bruce MacDonald, a GM vice-president, said: 'There is no substance to
these rumours at all.' He complained that such reports 'just do irreparable
harm to the morale and enthusiasm of this organisation'.
Mr Stempel, 59, was taken to hospital in Washington last week suffering from
high blood pressure, but has since resumed his executive responsibilities.
The Post claimed directors wanted to use the illness as an excuse for Mr
Stempel to step aside gracefully.
The board made clear last April it was displeased with Mr Stempel's
performance when it replaced him as chairman of the company's important
executive committee with Mr John Smale, an outside director who once ran
Procter & Gamble.
At that time it also ousted Mr Stempel's right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, as
president and head of North American operations, replacing him with Mr John
Smith, formerly in charge of its international business.
GM is expected to announce third-quarter losses of up to Dollars 845m next
week and needs to slash its manufacturing costs in the US. But some analysts
argue the company's executives have yet to convince the workforce of the
urgency of the task.
