FT  04 SEP 93 / Court plea on Thorp tests fails


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


GREENPEACE, the environmental group, yesterday failed in its second attempt
to stop uranium testing at British Nuclear Fuels' Thorp reprocessing plant
in Cumbria.
The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 majority decision, rejected the plea for an
order stopping the tests before the High Court examines their legality on
September 14.
Greenpeace is arguing that the tests, which will contaminate part of the
Pounds 2.8bn plant with radioactivity, prejudice the government's decision
on whether to give the plant a licence to start operation. The government
has already said it is 'minded' to grant a licence, but will decide finally
after the public consultation ends on October 4.
Yesterday's ruling on the testing still leaves Greenpeace free to challenge
the eventual decision on the licence.
Lord Justice Glidewell and Lord Justice Scott agreed there was nothing in
the fresh evidence before the court to invalidate the ruling of Mr Justice
Brooke on Wednesday that BNF should be allowed to begin the tests before
September 14.
Lord Justice Evans said the new evidence showed that although the first
phase of testing had started on Thursday, contaminating uranium would not be
introduced 'into the machinery' until the second phase began in about a
week.
