FT  16 NOV 93 / People: No grouses for Ivory at Highland Distilleries


Brian Ivory, managing director of Highland Distilleries, is to become group
chief executive next August.
Highland Distilleries is a medium-sized quoted whisky company, with a market
capitalisation of some Pounds 342m, whose best known brand is Famous Grouse,
whose sales in export markets are expanding, already contributing 55 per
cent of profits.
The current executive chairman, John Goodwin, will reach the company's
retirement age of 62 in August 1994. But Goodwin, who has spent almost 30
years on the board, will not be a stranger in future; he has been asked to
stay on as non-executive chairman.
The move is being announced relatively early, in order to prevent
speculation.
Ivory, 44, is a member of the east of Scotland family whose name occurs in
the Edinburgh fund managers Ivory & Sime and Stewart Ivory, where his older
brothers James and Ian are directors.
After education at Eton and Magdalene college, Cambridge, he trained as an
accountant before joining Highland Distilleries in 1976. He became managing
director in 1988.
Ivory considers that the arts head the list of of his non-professional
interests. He was on the Scottish Arts Council for several years, eventually
becoming its vice-chairman.
Moreover, he is also a keen practitioner of the bagpipes, and is involved in
a Pounds 3m project to house the College of Piping in a derelict church in
Glasgow.
