FT  06 AUG 93 / People: BT moves Earnshaw to US


Chris Earnshaw has been appointed to head the Dollars 1bn joint venture
between British Telecommunications and MCI, the US operator, launched with
great fanfare in June.
The joint venture, for which BT is putting up most of the cash, is designed
to fight AT&T, the US giant, in the emerging global market for providing
'one-stop' advanced telecommunications services to the world's
multinationals.
It still has to be christened, but as well as a chief executive, it now has
a home - Washington, a clear signal of BT's determination to expose its
offspring to the dynamic US telecoms market at birth.
At only 39, Earnshaw's ascent through BT has been meteoric. Joining the Post
Office (as it then was) straight from school in 1972, he earned a physics
degree the hard way as a mature student at Sheffield University.
His early career was in network modernisation. In 1988 he was given
responsibility for BT's technology and systems engineering for its network,
and a year later appointed Director, Networking.
His current job, managing director of Worldwide Networks, has given him a
key role in planning BT's global strategy.
Earnshaw formally takes up the post on the formation of the new company,
sometime next year. But he will be starting the work as soon as he gets back
from a short holiday - destination unknown.
