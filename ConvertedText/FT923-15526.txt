FT  01 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Short future gains


SHORT sterling futures were slightly firmer yesterday following the
battering they received on the previous day. Meanwhile, the pressure on
period rates eased.
The September futures contract opened two basis points higher at 90.09 as
dealers decided that Monday's harsh mark-down was overdone.
It traded within a five-point range to show some strength towards the close
and was finally 3 ticks up at 90.12 with just over 16,000 lots traded. The
December contract moved within a three-point range to close two points
better at 90.36 with more than 6,700 contracts dealt.
In the sterling cash market, some of the pressure that had been imposed on
period rates by technical factors resulting from the end of the first half
of the year disappeared and the key three-month interbank rate ended at 10
1/16 per cent, down  1/16 from Monday's level.
The Bank of England was unable to meet more than half of the day's forecast
liquidity shortage until the close. During the day's trading, rates moved up
to around 11 per cent before the Bank was prepared to take out the shortage.
The Bank provided three tranches of assistance of Pounds 50m, Pounds 171m
and Pounds 218m, making a total of Pounds 439m. The remainder was covered by
late assistance of Pounds 555m.
An initial shortage forecast of Pounds 950m was reflected largely by the
take-up of Treasury Bills and maturing assistance, which was expected to
drain Pounds 1.071bn from the system.
As most banks had balanced their books for the first half, they were
unwilling to sell their bills and the Bank of England initially provided
very little assistance - Pounds 48m of band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 and
Pounds 2m of bank bills in band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent.
In the second round, the shortage was revised up to Pounds 1bn and the Bank
bought Pounds 142m of band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 28m of
band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 1m of band 4 bank bills at
9 9/32 per cent.
By the afternoon, the shortage was adjusted back down to Pounds 950m and
assistance of Pounds 218m consisted of Pounds 158m of band 1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent, Pounds 10m of band 2 bank bills, also at 9 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 35m of band 3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 15m in band 4
bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
