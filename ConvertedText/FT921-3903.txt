FT  12 MAR 92 / Letter: Wind-up ploy gets results


   From Mr ROGER M MASON


Sir, Observer's report (March 2) of a petition to wind up the Pru makes me
wonder why this action is not more often taken against big companies. It is
invariably effective if money is owing, the company has the means to pay,
and does not wish to be wound up.
I present seminars on effective credit control and it is depressing to hear
complaints from small companies about the payment standards of some large
companies. Time and again the same names are mentioned (though Prudential is
not one of those, and, as far as I know, has a good record).
The chances of future business may be next to zero, but it is often worth
considering.
