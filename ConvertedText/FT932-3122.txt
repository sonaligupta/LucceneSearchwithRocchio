FT  16 JUN 93 / Abiola claims Nigerian win


   By REUTER


   LAGOS


NIGERIANS waited anxiously yesterday for official confirmation that business
baron Mr Moshood Abiola had won the country's presidential election, Reuter
reports from Lagos. The National Electoral Commission said it was carefully
checking results from Nigeria's 30 states before announcing the winner of
Saturday's poll.
Leading newspapers were in no doubt, reflecting victory claims by Mr Abiola
and his Social Democratic party. 'Abiola surges ahead,' said the Daily
Times, Nigeria's biggest-selling newspaper.
It said he was set for victory over the only other candidate, fellow-Moslem
millionaire Mr Bashir Tofa. Mr Tofa and his National Republican Convention
members started moves to try to get Mr Abiola disqualified on a
technicality.
