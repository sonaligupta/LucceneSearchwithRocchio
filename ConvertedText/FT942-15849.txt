FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto shares ahead despite earnings
setback


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Yule Catto, the chemicals and building products group, saw its shares jump
24p to 299p yesterday despite recording its first fall in earnings per share
since 1980.
Pre-tax profits for 1993 fell from Pounds 22.2m to Pounds 18.2m but the
underlying performance was better than analysts had expected and the company
made optimistic comments about the current year.
Lord Catto, chairman, said prospects for the building product companies,
mainly in continental Europe, were encouraging though it was too early to
determine whether a sustained recovery was under way.
Referring to the group as a whole he said: 'The current year has started
well with operating results ahead of our internal targets and the
corresponding period of 1993.'
Last year's figures were marred by the closure of the Dutch building facades
company, acquired for Pounds 3m in 1987. Excluding the Pounds 2.28m
provision for costs of closure and a Pounds 1.42m goodwill write-off,
operating profits were little changed at Pounds 24.2m (Pounds 24.3m).
The 1993 operating figure included Pounds 1.84m from speciality chemicals
acquisitions, which, after financing costs and minorities, made a small
contribution to earnings.
Earnings per share fell from 16p to 11.6p, partly reflecting the effects of
the rights issue. A proposed final dividend of 3.65p makes a total for the
year of 6.25p (5.9p).
The speciality chemicals business, a leading supplier of natural and
synthetic rubber, turned in record profits of Pounds 21.1m, up Pounds 2.3m,
thanks to the acquisitions and 'good performances across the board'.
The building products companies, which are linked mainly to commercial
construction and maintenance in continental Europe, saw profits fall by
Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5m; but that was after charging higher redundancy
costs which analysts estimated at Pounds 1m.
COMMENT
These figures may have spoilt Yule Catto's record but behind the Dutch
facade the figures were still better than expected with some encouraging
pointers for the current year. The chemicals companies are continuing to
perform well and with rationalisation of the building products side now
largely behind it profits should recover this year. Boosted by the rights
issue cash profits could reach Pounds 30m, which puts the shares on a
forward multiple of about 16, an undeserved discount to the sector.
