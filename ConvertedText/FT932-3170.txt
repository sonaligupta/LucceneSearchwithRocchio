FT  15 JUN 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Unitas falls to
FM512m loss in first four months

Correction (published 15th June 1993) appended to this article.
A DOUBLING of loan losses plunged Unitas, Finland's second-largest banking
group, deeper into the red in the first four months. However, credit
write-offs appear to be reaching a peak and should not exceed last year's
total.
Unitas reported pre-tax losses of FM512m (Dollars 93.9m) - almost twice the
level in the same period of 1992, when losses reached FM266m.
Write-offs on credits and guarantees rose by just over 100 per cent to
FM845m, from FM419m. However, the portfolio of non-performing credits fell
by FM268m from the end of 1992 to FM8.57bn at the end of April. Of this
total, some 18 per cent is accounted for by the trade, restaurant and hotel
sectors, 12 per cent by property and 10 per cent by the construction
industry.
Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive, said the result for the year would show
some improvement on the FM7.2bn loss in 1992, when credit losses tripled to
FM3.3bn. But he warned the result would remain 'severely negative'.
Mr Vainio predicted that Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of
Finland, would achieve its strategic objective of avoiding takeover by the
state, a fate that has already befallen two Finnish banking groups.
Due to a fall in its risk-weighted assets to FM127.3bn from FM130.4bn at the
end of 1992, the group's capital adequacy ratio under BIS calculations was
down only marginally to 11 per cent from 11.1 per cent.
Unitas said that even without the FM1.7bn in preferred capital it received
from the government last year, its capital adequacy ratio would be above the
international minimum of 8 per cent.
Net interest income rose 7.5 per cent to FM686m. There was also a 38 per
cent rise in other income to FM697m. However, group operating expenses rose
6.4 per cent to FM881m.
CORRECTION
The Financial Times yesterday incorrectly reported the 1992 result for
Unitas, the Finnish bank. The company returned a loss of FM2.7bn (Dollars
491m).
