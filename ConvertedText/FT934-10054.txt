FT  08 NOV 93 / Portillo talks about his generation


   By JAMES BLITZ


MR MICHAEL PORTILLO, chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday that
the government needed to prepare younger people for a time when they would
receive fewer benefits than pensioners receive now.
In an interview on ITV's Walden programme, Mr Portillo said he was in favour
of the state continuing to provide services in education and health but he
argued that, over time, the size of state spending, at 45 per cent of GDP,
had to be scaled back.
'People could be told at an early stage that the state could not look after
them as well as they deserved.
'The generation I am talking about is my generation and below. We are people
who ought to be responsible. And we ought to consider what is going to
happen to us in the next century.'
Mr Portillo argued that a growing number of people in Britain were able to
opt out of state-supported benefit schemes because of the growth of personal
wealth.
