FT  29 JUL 92 / International Company News: Tenneco shows sharp improvement


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


TENNECO, the Houston-based conglomerate in the throes of restructuring,
yesterday reported a sharp improvement in second-quarter profitability and a
return to the black by its long-struggling JI Case agricultural equipment
business.
However, Tenneco warned that poor market conditions would return Case to the
red in the third quarter, albeit with lower losses than last year, while the
outlook for the fourth quarter was too uncertain to predict.
On Monday Deere & Co, another leading manufacturer of agricultural
equipment, said weak retail markets both in the US and abroad meant its
equipment operations would incur a net loss for the final six months.
Tenneco, which has been cutting costs sharply since the arrival of Mr Mike
Walsh, its new chief executive, reported net income of Dollars 178m, or
Dollars 1.23 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 15 cents, in
the second quarter last year. Revenues were unchanged at Dollars 3.4bn.
Some 71 cents of the earnings per share came from continuing operations and
52 cents from discontinued ones - mainly a gain from the sale of the
company's mineral operations.
Mr Walsh said despite the problems at Case, the group's outlook for the rest
of the year was for continued favourable comparisons with 1991.
Case reported an operating profit of Dollars 11m - its first profit in six
quarters - compared with a loss of Dollars 123m a year ago. This was despite
a 10 per cent drop in sales revenue.
The company said about 40 per cent of the Dollars 134m positive swing came
from cost reduction, 40 per cent from price increases and 20 per cent from
other factors. Operating expenses had been reduced by Dollars 45m. Much was
due to job cuts which by the end of the year will have lowered Case's
headcount to 19,000, from 30,000 at the end of 1990.
However, Tenneco warned that Case's production cuts had not been sufficient
to keep up with a year-on-year drop of about 20 per cent in demand, both in
the construction and agricultural equipment markets. As a result, production
would now be cut by an additional 9 per cent and this, coupled with earlier
production, would mean 1992 production about 20 per cent below 1991.
Tenneco's other businesses also reported improved results: Packaging
Corporation of America had operating income of Dollars 59m, up from Dollars
25m; chemicals group Albright & Wilson made Dollars 19m, against Dollars 7m;
Tenneco Gas made Dollars 73m, against Dollars 67m; automotive made Dollars
73m, up from Dollars 66m; and the Newport News shipyard was Dollars 1m ahead
at Dollars 67m
In the first half the group made net income of Dollars 211m, or Dollars 1.43
a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 13m, or 18 cents, a year ago.
