FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (2): Outlook remains
gloomy - Market prospects in Europe


   By KEVIN DONE


THE western European truck industry is in its third year of decline, and the
short-term outlook remains gloomy with forecasts suggesting a further
significant drop in demand in 1993.
The latest forecast by DRI, the London-based automotive analysts, suggests
that truck sales (6 tonnes gross vehicle weight and above) across the main
15 markets in western Europe will have fallen by 10.5 per cent this year to
around 246,000.
There is little relief in prospect in 1993 with truck sales forecast to fall
again by as much as 8 per cent to 226,000, before a modest recovery begins
in 1994.
While truck sales have been falling in Europe overall, the extraordinary
boom in Germany in the wake of unification has masked the speed of the
decline in other markets.
The share taken by Germany in the overall western European truck market has
virtually doubled from around 20 per cent in 1989 to around 40 per cent this
year. According to DRI figures truck sales (6 tonnes and above) in Germany
increased by 22.8 per cent in 1990 to 68,000 and jumped again by 54.4 per
cent in 1991 to 106,000.
Supported by the surge in Germany, truck sales overall in western Europe
fell by only 7 per cent from the peak of 296,000 in 1989 to 275,000 in 1991.
Excluding Germany, however, truck sales in the rest of Europe have plunged
in the past two years by 29 per cent.
Since mid-1992 the market has begun to turn downwards in Germany, too, after
the last two years of record sales, however, and there has been little sign
of a recovery elsewhere in Europe to compensate for weakening German sales.
With such a wide disparity between the performance of different markets,
truck makers have been subjected to sharply contrasting changes in fortune
with most of the benefits accruing to Mercedes-Benz and MAN, the two German
truck makers which control around three-quarters of their domestic market.
Mercedes-Benz captured a third of European sales in 1991 and MAN has boosted
its share from 8 per cent before unification to more than 12 per cent this
year.
The scale of the impact of German unification on the truck industry coupled
with the decline in demand in other European markets can be judged from the
fact that eastern Germany alone has emerged as Europe's second biggest truck
market in the first eight months this year.
According to Automotive Industry Data, the UK-based automotive industry
analysts, new truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) in eastern Germany alone
totalled 28,660 in the first eight months this year compared with 25,818 in
France and only 20,633 in the UK.
The UK, Spain and the Scandinavian countries, which led the present decline
into recession, have suffered the largest falls since the European market
peaked in 1989.
Truck sales in the UK have dropped by more than 50 per cent in the past
three years, while the Spanish market has fallen by 43 per cent, and Sweden
now has a market only a third of its former size.
According to the DRI European truck forecast report published this month
'the summer months have brought a significant deterioration in market
conditions to many of the European markets . . . turmoil in European
currency markets, deteriorating national economies and increasing
uncertainties over the prospects of any economic recovery in the short-term
have added to the mood of gloom and general unease in the truck industry.
'The glow of German unification and the boom it injected into the market is
fast fading away as the the market faces re-adjustment to lower levels of
demand.'
The prospects overall for European truck sales next year have deteriorated
as forecasts have been revised downwards in particular for France and Italy,
which are not expected to be able to compensate for the accelerating slide
in German demand.
Truck sales in France (six tonnes and above) are forecast by DRI to rise by
only 2.4 per cent next year after three years of sharp decline, with sales
falling in Italy by 10.4 per cent and in Germany by 23.2 per cent.
'With a severe contraction in the German market, and weaker demand prospects
in other European countries, truck registrations are forecast to decline by
up to a further 8 per cent in 1993, before some measure of returning
confidence and improved investment climate provide a firmer foundation for
growth in truck demand.'
The DRI forecast does see a resumption of modest growth in European truck
demand from 1994, but total sales are only forecast to reach 261,000 by
1997, still well below the peak years at the end of the 1980s.
In the UK the first signs of a modest recovery are appearing but only after
three years of deep recession have taken a heavy toll on the industry.
In July truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) showed the first
monthly year-on-year increase in 34 months finally ending a period in which
sales had plunged by 60 per cent in three years.
The breakthrough achieved in July has been sustained for four months with UK
truck sales showing year-on-year increases for four consecutive months from
July to October. The decline earlier in the year, however, means that for
the first 10 months UK truck sales were still 4.3 per cent lower than in the
corresponding period a year earlier.
Since 1989, overall UK commercial vehicle sales have suffered the steepest
and deepest fall into recession of the post-Second World War period. Truck
sales have fallen to a level not seen since the early 1950s, and the
recovery is therefore coming from a very low base.
The recent improvement should be sustained in 1993 and 1994 according to the
latest DRI forecast, which suggests that sales of trucks (6 tonnes and
above) could increase by 13 per cent in 1993 to 32,700 and by 14 per cent to
37,400 in 1994.
It is expected that pressures in the UK to replace older trucks, which have
been retained during the recession, will become more intense. 'Many truck
operators will be experiencing rising costs as they hang on to vehicles
beyond the point at which they would normally renew them if trading
conditions were better,' says the DRI report.
An early sign of improving prospects is coming from the truck rental sector
in the UK, which operators often turn to as a means of adding capacity in
the short-term, when they are uncertain about embarking on a new truck
purchase to meet higher demand.
Despite falling sales in western Europe, truck makers in Europe managed to
increase production modestly by 2.2 per cent last year to 324,000, helped by
exports to overseas markets with important orders coming from north Africa
and the Middle East. Output fell in 1990 by 13.4 per cent to 317,000.
The latest DRI study suggests that the fall in truck production (6 tonnes
and above) will have been resumed this year with a drop of around 7.5 per
cent to 300,000, however. Output is forecast to decline further in 1993 by
5.2 per cent to 285,000. Production reached a peak of 366,000 in 1989.
In previous recessions in Europe, which had been triggered by steep
increases in oil prices, the western European truck industry had been able
to cushion demand losses at home through sharply higher exports to the
oil-producing countries.
'This time the nature of the recession is different and is accompanied by a
weak global outlook with real commodity prices remaining low, and little
prospect for exports to make up domestic shortfalls,' says DRI.
With the main impulses for recovery coming from domestic demand in Europe,
DRI forecasts the start of a modest recovery in output in 1994 with an
increase of 3.1 per cent to 293,000.
