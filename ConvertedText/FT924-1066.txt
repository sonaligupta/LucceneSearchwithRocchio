A CONFUSION OF PROPHETS: VICTORIAN AND EDWARDIAN ASTROLOGY by Patrick Curry
Collins & Brown Pounds 18, 192 pages
ASTROLOGY slipped from its zenith in the mid-17th century to its nadir in
the rationalist 18th. But what happened in the sentimental 19th century?
Patrick Curry has filled A Confusion of Prophets with bewildering
information; but he does so indiscriminately, so it takes a soothsayer to
divine the salient facts.
Curry offers five short biographies. John Varley (1778-1842) was friendly
with William Blake in the 1820s. He used the poet's visionary bouts for
collaborative spiritual research, conjuring Wat Tyler, Richard Coeur de Lion
and Moses from a zodiacal past. Varley suggested the subject, Blake drew it;
these drawings of 'zodiacal physiognomy' remained undiscovered until 1989.
Varley combined knowledge of individuals with specific, unavoidable
prediction. He impressed other luminaries: Ruskin, Turner and John Sell
Cotman. Bulwer Lytton consulted Varley about Disraeli's future, and received
the safe prognostication: 'he will bequeath a repute out of all proportion
to the opinion now entertained of his intellect, even by those who think
highly of it.'
After Varley comes Robert 'Raphael' Smith (b1795), occultist, astrologer,
and editor of various prognostic rags in the early 1820s. On the back of The
Prophetic Messenger, which reached sales of over 250,000 by 1830, 'Raphael'
wrote the 1828 Manual of Astrology. This was his annus mirabilis, for
although 'Raphael' failed to predict his own death four years later, he
reported an incognito visit from George IV, at which 'DEATH WAS FORETOLD
within the short space of two years]' George died on June 26 1830.
Royal death was the astrologer's livelihood. The full moon in March 1861
prompted Richard 'Zadkiel' Morrison (1795-1874) to predict: 'the position of
Saturn in the third degree of Virgo in May, following upon this lunation,
will be very evil for all persons born on or near the August 26; among the
sufferers I regret to see the worthy Prince Consort of these realms.' Albert
obliged by dying on December 14. This made Morrison's reputation and
Zadkiel's Almanac sold steadily during the 1870s and 1880s.
The great populist, however, was Alan Leo (1860-1917): karmic astrologer and
luminary of the Theosophical Society; the theosophist who took the hand of
palmist Ada Phillips, and headed for a predictable married future. Leo
founded the Astrological Society (at noon on January 14 1895).
Leo is the most modern of Curry's quintet. His lasting contribution to
astrology was the notion that attitude of mind towards events was key, not
the events in themselves.
