FT  03 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Manders expects surge in profits


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


MANDERS, the Wolverhampton-based paint, ink and property group, yesterday
forecast annual profits of at least Pounds 8.2m and a 20 per cent rise in
the dividend as part of its defence against the Pounds 89m bid by rival
paints group Kalon.
The forecast, which compares with 1991 profits of Pounds 6m, accompanied
interim results showing a 66 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
4.1m.
The interim dividend, payable on November 9, is being raised 30 per cent to
2.6p which, with the forecast final of 5.8p, makes an 8.4p (7p) total.
Mr Roy Amos, chairman, said the interim rise showed 'the underlying strength
of Manders' businesses even in the midst of a recession.' The group refused
to specify the contribution from Windeck, the paint manufacturer purchased
for Pounds 5.66m in December.
Mr Mike Hennesy, managing director of Kalon, believed the underlying
performance without Windeck was disappointing.
Mr Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, said the profits rise was due to
acquisitions and organic growth. However, it also reflected the sale of the
loss-making tile distribution business in March.
Turnover for the six months to June 30 rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 56.1m.
Earnings improved from 5.26p to 7.74p.
Mr Akers was scornful of Kalon's 8-for-3 offer, valuing Manders shares at
241p. He compared the 18 per cent fall in Kalon's share price since the
offer was launched in June with the 10.6 per cent decline in the FTA
All-Share. 'At this level, it is far too cheap,' he said. Kalon's shares
closed steady on Friday at 90.5p, while Manders rose 10p to 239p.
