FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chicago wheat futures bounce
after early fall

WHEAT FUTURES prices at the Chicago Board of Trade bounced yesterday after
early profit-taking following the previous two days of rises, which had
taken them to life-of contract highs .
By mid-morning, the spot contract had risen 1.25 cents to Dollars 4.1425,
while May wheat rose by 1.75 cents to Dollars 3.99, July by 3.25 cents to
Dollars 374.5 and September by 3.5 cents to Dollars 377.
The increases came after some contracts had fallen by several cents. Wheat
has been rising since the US Agriculture Department revealed at the start of
the week that farmers had planted fewer acres of winter wheat and that wheat
stocks were at their lowest point for almost two decades. World wheat stocks
are also low.
Adding to the price pressures are continued good demand and below par
growing conditions for the winter wheat crop, said grain analyst Mr Richard
Feltes of Refco.
Some analysts are suggesting that wheat could rise to as much as Dollars 5
per bushel, though tough price resistance is expected at Dollars 4.50.
