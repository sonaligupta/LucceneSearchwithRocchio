FT  22 JUL 94 / Ecuador parliament rejects telecom sale


   By RAYMOND COLITT


   QUITO


The Ecuadorian government has suffered a severe blow to its privatisation
programme with parliament's rejection of a bill to allow the sale of shares
in the state telephone company, Emetel, which is worth an estimated Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Opposition parties claimed the reform was unconstitutional since the
constitution states that the telecommunications sector should be controlled
by the state because of its strategic importance to the economy.
The opposition also objected to the government's decision to see the
legislation through on the fast track, which, they said, allowed them
insufficient time to analyse it.
However, the government argued that as long as the state was in regulatory
control of the sector, the constitution allowed for private-sector operation
of telecommunications.
The state modernisation body, Conam, insisted that reform efforts would
continue despite the bill's defeat.
Ecuador's privatisation programme has been criticised for poor management
and under-pricing. However, the latest setback comes only a week after the
successful sale of the country's second largest cement company, Cementos
Selva Alegre, which had improved the programme's image.
The Spanish cement giant, Uniland, bought 51 per cent of the state's shares
in Cementos Selva Alegre for Dollars 40m, on behalf of the consortium,
Finlatam.
With only eight in 100 citizens having a telephone line, Ecuador has one of
the most backward telecommunication systems in Latin America. The investment
required to install 1m more telephone lines and improve the infrastructure
is estimated at Dollars 1.4bn. Telephone lines go for as much as Dollars
1,000 on the black market.
