FT  14 APR 94 / Creditors of Banco Latino affiliate to meet


   By STEPHEN FIDLER


   GUADALAJARA


Holders of certificates of deposit issued last year by the Curacao affiliate
of Banco Latino, the failed Venezuelan bank, are to hold a creditors'
meeting in Curacao tomorrow.
An official of ING Bank, the Dutch institution which managed one of two
issues, said about Dollars 50m (Pounds 34.2m) of certificates of deposit
were outstanding. Some Dollars 30m were issued in August or September last
year, which have matured but not been repaid. A further Dollars 20m were
issued in November but have yet to mature.
Banco Latino in Venezuela collapsed in January after a run on deposits. It
reopened on April 4 but only to service small depositors. The bank's
troubles heightened problems in the Venezuelan banking sector, and the
government was forced to step in to support a further five banks which could
otherwise have collapsed.
Bankers present in Guadalajara said the second issue was managed by Banco
Interunion, a subsidiary of the Dutch bank and Banco Latino operating in the
Caribbean island of Curacao. Some suggested the amount of outstanding
certificates of deposit in fact approached Dollars 70m, but that these were
the only known international offerings by an affiliate of Banco Latino.
The position of Banco Latino Curacao is complicated, according to Venezuelan
bankers, by the fact that it is not a direct subsidiary of the Venezuelan
bank but merely shares the same shareholders. It has been alleged that the
Curacao bank was used to dump bad or otherwise questionable loans.
It was also reported that Banco Latino in Venezuela owes about Dollars 5m to
the US Export-Import Bank and Dollars 100m to the US Commodity Credit
Corporation. Exim Bank, with about Dollars 3bn outstanding in Venezuela, is
said to be concerned not about the size of the loan but the precedent that
non-payment would set.
