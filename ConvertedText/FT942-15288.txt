FT  15 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities Futures and Options Trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


Derivatives dealers reported a lacklustre trading session as traders watched
developments in the bond markets, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the June contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 3,167.
Buying mainly from independent traders saw it move gently ahead to reach the
day's high of 3,178, mid morning.
The retreat in UK gilts brought a turnaround in the fortunes of June and the
contract drifted lower as a nervous period set in as dealers waited for news
on German interest rates. The downing of two US helicopters also unsettled
trading ahead of lunch. The reduction in rates by the Bundesbank reversed
some of the earlier decline before the weakness in bond markets once again
led to renewed selling which saw the contract test the 3,139 support level.
It finished at 3,141, at a premium to cash, with volume improving to 14,698
lots. The mid 250 contract was also busy, trading 425 contracts and closing
at 3,785.
Volume in traded options at 42,055 was just below Wednesday's level. The
FT-SE 100 option traded 16,254 lots and the Euro FT-SE 7,841 contracts.
Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,212 lots dealt followed
by Redland at 1,905.
