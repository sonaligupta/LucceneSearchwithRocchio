FT  16 DEC 94 / Carter awaits evidence of ceasefire to take up Bosnian Serb
invitation to mediate


   By Our Foreign Staff


Former US president Jimmy Carter was yesterday waiting for evidence of a
cessation of hostilities in Sarajevo before deciding whether to leave on a
private mediation mission at the invitation of the Bosnian Serbs, writes Our
Foreign Staff.
A White House spokesman said Mr Carter could be 'on his way in 24 hours' if
the lull continued. In an interview with Cable News Network television on
Wednesday night, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic asked Mr Carter to
mediate and proposed a six-point plan to give up some territory, agree an
immediate ceasefire around Sarajevo and the re-opening of the city airport,
release detained UN officers and Moslem prisoners of war younger than 19
years old, and allow free passage of relief convoys.
There was general US scepticism, voiced strongly in Brussels by Mr William
Perry, US defence secretary, and by others, that Mr Karadzic was engaged in
more than a public relations ploy designed to secure some form of
recognition for his regime.
Mr Perry said Mr Carter had promised not to deviate from the existing
international peace plan as the basis for a long-term settlement.
In London, senior government officials said they welcomed any attempt by Mr
Carter to broker peace in the region but admitted they were 'sceptical
rather than cynical' about what such an intervention could achieve.
