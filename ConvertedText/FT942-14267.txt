FT  21 APR 94 / Further Lloyd's actions planned


   By RICHARD LAPPER


An increasing number of aggrieved Lloyd's Names are considering taking
individual legal action in the wake of last week's successful court cases by
two lossmakers.
Mr David Tiplady, solicitor with DJ Freeman, said he had started acting on
behalf of six further individual Names in the past few days. 'The level of
interest has been phenomenal,' said Mr Tiplady, who represents about 50
Names in individual actions.
Most litigation by Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance
market - is being co-ordinated by action groups. The biggest group has 3,000
Gooda Walker Names and its action comes to court next week. Many of the
individual actions centre on allegations that Names were placed on high-risk
syndicates against their wishes.
Indemnity Insurance Services, a specialised insurance broker which supplies
Names with a stop-loss (or personal reinsurance) facility, forecasts says
Lloyd's Names will face losses of Pounds 2.37bn when the market reports its
results for 1991 next month. The figure is made up of Pounds 1.13bn relating
to losses incurred on business underwritten in 1991 and Pounds 1.24bn on
business written in previous years.
Earlier this month Chatset, the market analyst, said 1991 losses could
exceed Pounds 3bn.
