FT  04 AUG 92 / Turkey soothes Syria fears

SYRIA and Turkey have decided to revive joint ministerial meetings on water
and agriculture.
During a weekend visit, Mr Hikmet Cetin, the Turkish foreign minister,
reassured Mr Farouq al-Shara, his counterpart in Damascus, that Turkey would
continue the supply of water to Syria, as under previous agreements.
Turkey controls the Euphrates river and has plans to irrigate more than 1m
hectares close to the Syrian border as part of its Dollars 32bn Gap project.
Water, however, is also vital for Syrian agriculture, and domestic and
industrial supply.
Under a 1987 protocol, a flow of 500 cubic metres a second, or about half
the average discharge, was guaranteed at the common border, while Turkey's
Dollars 4bn Ataturk dam was under construction.
Turkish water officials say Syria can only use about a third of that amount,
given saline soils and a higher rate of evaporation. Even so, Turkey has
proposed various joint projects, including a plan to flood the common border
to maximise power generation. It has also offered to supply power to cities
in northern Syria.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's prime minister, last month strongly rejected
Syrian calls to share the water: 'We do not say we should share their oil
resources. They cannot say they should share our water resources.'
However, Mr Cetin's visit could pave the way for financial assistance for
the Gap from World Bank and other western donors, which have been wary of
supporting a project under dispute. Co-operation will be further enhanced by
the weekend decision to revive the joint agriculture and water meetings.
