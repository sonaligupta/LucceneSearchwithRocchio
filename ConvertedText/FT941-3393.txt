FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Heywood Williams in sixfold rise to Pounds
35.2m


   Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent
Pre-tax profits of Heywood Williams Group, the building and automotive
components group, rose more than six times in 1993 from Pounds 5.5m to
Pounds 35.2m.
The company was assisted by significant gains following a series of
disposals and acquisitions. Operating profits, even after stripping out
these benefits, still rose by 86 per cent from Pounds 8.02m to Pounds
14.99m.
The Pounds 95m sale of the group's UK glass division to Pilkington added a
further Pounds 15m to these profits. Another Pounds 2.99m came from the
first six months earnings of LaSalle-Deitch, which supplies components and
furnishings for manufactured homes in the US.
Interest on Heywood's cash balances, currently about Pounds 10m, increased
pre-tax profits by another Pounds 500,000, compared with a debit of Pounds
3.02m.
Bridgewater, the UK automotive glass replacement business acquired last
autumn, and which is in the process of being re-organised, also contributed
a small profit.
Since the year end Heywood has completed the acquisition of Bristol
Products, the US plumbing components supplier, for Dollars 81.2m (Pounds
53.4m). The purchase was funded by a rights issue which raised Pounds 52.4m
at the end of last year.
The company, as forecast, is paying a final dividend of 8.5p (8p) making a
total for the year of 13p (12.5), the first dividend increase for two years.
Earnings per share were 36.2p (1.7p) or 32.9p (1.7p) diluted or 15.5p (1.7p)
before exceptional profit on the disposal to Pilkington. Turnover fell from
Pounds 389.5m to Pounds 365.6m.
The shares following the announcement rose 7p to 437p compared with a rights
issue price in December of 280p.
Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, chairman, said: 'The sale of the under-performing UK
glass businesses, and the acquisitions we have made to secure and strengthen
key market positions in the more buoyant US manufactured housing and
recreational vehicles markets, has transformed our prospects.'
COMMENT
The tide is starting to turn in favour of Heywood Williams' main markets. US
housing and automotive businesses, accounting for almost half of group
turnover, are growing stronger as the economy recovers. Bad winter weather,
also, will have had less of an impact on manufactured homes than on general
housebuilding. In the UK, the homes market should continue to improve, while
increased investment in depots should offset any temporary softening of the
market following last year's introduction of windscreen checking in MoT
tests. Pre-tax profits could approach Pounds 40m this year. A quality
management and strong balance sheet makes the company worth an investment at
this level.
