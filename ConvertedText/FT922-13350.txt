FT  11 APR 92 / Names to step up demands for redress


   By RICHARD LAPPER


NAMES IN dispute with their agents and the Lloyd's authorities over
insurance losses have decided to form a working party to co-ordinate their
activities, Richard Lapper writes. They intend to press more energetically
for a negotiated solution to their difficulties.
Mr Peter Nutting, who will chair the new group, said: 'The working party
wishes to help Lloyd's to find a solution to the problems that face both
Lloyd's and its Names.'
Mr David Berriman, deputy chairman, commented: 'If all that policyholders
hear about Lloyd's is litigation, it will damage Lloyd's very seriously.'
