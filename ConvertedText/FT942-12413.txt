FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Recession puts Folkes in red


Folkes Group, the property and engineering concern, fell into the red in
1993 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.72m, against profits of Pounds 1m.
Continuing activities showed profits down from Pounds 2.31m to Pounds 1.1m.
Mr Constantine Folkes, chairman, said that the recession and fierce
competition had resulted in a squeeze on margins.
Turnover was Pounds 39.4m (Pounds 39.8m) of which Pounds 35.6m (Pounds
34.1m) was related to continuing activities. Exports increased by 17 per
cent, which meant they represented 20 per cent of sales.
Property reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 2.4m) as
vacant commercial property was cut from 13 per cent to 6 per cent over the
year. Engineering and services showed a loss of Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 68,000)
despite severe cost cutting due to a deterioration in market prices.
Losses per share were 4.68p (earnings 1.24p) but in view of prospects, the
recommended final dividend is held at 0.925p for an unchanged total of 1.5p.
