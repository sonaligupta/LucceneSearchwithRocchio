FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fairline back to interim surplus with
turnround to Pounds 0.16m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


FAIRLINE Boats, the luxury powerboat maker, yesterday announced a return to
pre-tax profits of Pounds 161,000 at the half-way stage from losses of
Pounds 613,000 a year earlier, benefiting from the devaluation of sterling.
The shares closed down 42p at 390p reversing a 44p rise on Monday following
favourable press comment in the weekend press.
Mr Sam Newington, chairman, said the figures reflected both lower
development costs and the publicity value of devaluation among overseas
buyers: 'When sterling devalues it's news. Our customers know our boats will
be cheaper.'
He expressed concern, though, about Fairline's main European markets. 'We
expect to see some recovery in UK sales although it will be difficult to
maintain export momentum to other European countries.'
Turnover, of which about 85 per cent was overseas with Germany as the main
market, rose to Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 12.3m) in the six months to end-March.
Direct exports, some 70 per cent of total turnover, were up by 45 per cent.
The UK distributor also sells to overseas customers. Home sales were down 15
per cent.
Fairline said the European Community's January 1 extension of VAT on its
exports had not yet affected the market. It feared the proposal move to
claim some VAT on boats sold up to eight years ago, could depress prices in
the secondhand market, which might have a knock-on effect on upgrade trade.
The company had about Pounds 1.2m in net cash and trade debtors of Pounds
2.4m in March. It generated between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 500,000 cash
in the half year and has now paid off almost all of a low interest Pounds
1.65m EC loan, leaving negligible borrowings.
In January it launched the Targa 38 and plans a 28-footer next January. The
company said it hoped to sell the smaller boats on the back of the
established brand name of the bigger boats it has developed.
The board declared a maintained interim dividend of 3.575p and earnings per
share were 3p against losses of 11.8p.
