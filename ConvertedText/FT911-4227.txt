FT  20 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar hits 16-month high


THE DOLLAR renewed its upward surge yesterday after going through a period
of consolidation since Easter. The rise started in mid-February and appeared
to have resumed yesterday as the currency hit its highest level for about 16
months against the D-Mark.
This took it to a trading peak of DM1.7380 in reaction to a US press report
that a Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 26 agreed unanimously
that interest rates may have been pushed low enough to end the recession.
It was also agreed that there will be no further cuts before the next FOMC
meeting on May 14, unless there is surprisingly bad news about the economy,
according to the report.
This led to demand for the dollar in the Far East, with the trend continuing
when Europe and New York came into the market. The D-Mark was particularly
vulnerable as a result of problems caused by German unification and
political unrest in the Soviet Union. Attention turned back to these
economic and political factors following the failure of the Bundesbank to
raise official interest rates at Thursday's council meeting.
Comments by German central bank officials had little impact. Mr Karl Otto
Pohl, Bundesbank president, said that German monetary policy will remain
tight and that a relatively high level of interest rates has to be accepted.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, deputy president of the Bundesbank, told German
television that the central bank is not satisfied with the D-Mark's value
against the dollar, but added that last week's higher rate at a securities
repurchase agreement tender was technical and not a signal of changed
monetary policy.
At the London close the dollar had climbed to DM1.7360 from DM1.6880; to
Y138.35 from Y136.70; to SFr1.4705 from SFr1.4415; and to FFr5.8575 from
FFr5.7000. Its index rose to 66.3 from 65.1.
The D-Mark also weakened against the Japanese yen, falling below an import
support level of Y80.00, to Y79.70 from Y81.00 in London.
Sterling fell 5 cents to Dollars 1.7220 and was slightly weaker against
several of its partners in the ERM, but was steady against the D-Mark.
Figures from the European Commission kept the pound in second strongest
place in the ERM.
Sterling closed unchanged at DM2.9900 but fell to FFr10.0875 from
FFr10.1000; to SFr2.5325 from SFr2.5550; and to Y238.25 from Y242.25. Its
index lost 0.8 to 92.2.
Rumours that sterling and the Spanish peseta may soon join the narrow 2.25
per cent band in the ERM drew replies of 'no comment' from the Bank of Spain
and the UK Treasury.
