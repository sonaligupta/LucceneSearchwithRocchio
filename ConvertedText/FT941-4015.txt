FT  14 MAR 94 / Last post for La Suisse


   By REUTER


   GENEVA


La Suisse, once the most popular daily newspaper in French-speaking
Switzerland, brought out its final edition on Sunday after almost 96 years
on the streets, Reuter reports from Geneva.
The independent Geneva daily had been hit by financial problems, including a
sharp fall in advertising revenue over the past five years.
In an emotional closing edition, marked 'Final' in large black letters, the
paper's 400 staff pledged to continue their battle to save and relaunch the
title.
