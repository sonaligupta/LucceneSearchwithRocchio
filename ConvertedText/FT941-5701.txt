FT  04 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as bond yields
turn higher

Wall Street
US share prices were mixed in listless trading yesterday as the stock market
settled down after Wednesday's wild gyrations, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a slight 7.32 easier at
3,824.42. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 lost 1.80 at 463.01,
while the American SE composite slipped 0.67 to 465.65 but the Nasdaq
composite gained 1.11 at 784.58. NYSE volume was moderate by recent
standards at 292m shares.
Wednesday's late rally, concentrated mostly in cyclicals, failed to feed
through into early gains yesterday. Instead, investors sold off the big Dow
Industrial stocks that had done well in the previous session.
The selling was mostly prompted by another rise in bond yields. By late
afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was off three-quarters of a point, and
the yield had crept up to 6.832 per cent.
The decline in bonds, and some of the selling of stocks, reflected
nervousness ahead of today's jobs data. The February employment report is
being keenly awaited because some economists believe another indication of
strength in the labour market could be the trigger for a further interest
rate increase from the Federal Reserve.
These concerns were heightened yesterday when the weekly jobless claims
figures showed an unexpectedly big fall in the number of people filing for
state unemployment insurance. The day's other data, a 2.1 per cent rise in
January factory orders, also pointed to a robust economy.
Retailers bucked the trend, advancing as a group in the wake of surprisingly
strong monthly sales figures. Federated Department Stores put on Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 24 1/2 , the Gap Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 46 1/8 , JC Penney
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 55 3/4 and the Limited Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 19
7/8 .
Some of the cyclicals which did well on Wednesday weakened, with Alcoa
relinquishing Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 74 7/8 and Union Carbide Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 24. Car makers were in mixed form, with General Motors holding
steady at Dollars 60 1/2 , Chrysler firming Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 58 and
Ford shedding Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 63 5/8 .
Computer shares, which were hard hit on Wednesday, were also mixed. Compaq
recovered from recent selling to jump Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 98 and Texas
Instruments moved up Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 83 3/8 , but Hewlett-Packard
failed to hold on to an early gain and lost a net Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 89
1/4 .

Toronto ended mildly firmer after a technical bounce, but traders said the
market remains edgy after recent rate-related volatility. The TSE 300
composite index improved 8.0 to 4,370.2 and rises outnumbered declines by
401 to 333 after volume of 49.5m shares.
Nine of the 14 stock groups gained ground but with none showing a major
swing. Consumer products, media, mining and energy rose. Golds, industrial
products and financial services were little changed.
Malette tumbled CDollars 1 to CDollars 10 1/4 after announcing that it has
agreed to sell 2.5m shares at CDollars 10.25 each to a group of
underwriters.
