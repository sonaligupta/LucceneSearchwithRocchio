FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: AMR blames fares war for loss

   NEW YORK


AMR, the parent company of American Airlines and one of the three largest US
carriers, yesterday revealed a third-quarter after-tax loss of Dollars 85m -
the worst result it has recorded for a July-September period.
The summer months are when airlines traditionally make much of their money.
Even in 1991, a bad year for the industry, AMR posted net third-quarter
profits of Dollars 70m.
Mr Robert Crandall, the company's chairman, yesterday called the results
'very unsatisfactory'. He blamed the domestic fare wars which generated
extremely cheap tickets for summer travel earlier this year. 'Our
third-quarter revenue problem was caused primarily by very low domestic
yields,' he said, pointing out that yield fell from 12.52 cents a year
earlier to 10.66 cents in the third quarter of 1992.
'The impact of this on American was compounded by the fact that American's
domestic system is the largest in the industry and represents a large
percentage of our total revenues.'
Hurricane Andrew, which caused damage in southern Florida and Louisiana in
late August, also had an adverse effect, he said, as did 'the fact that the
company, because of previously-scheduled aircraft deliveries, grew more
rapidly during the third quarter than most other airlines."
However, American, which is seen a bellwether for the troubled US airline
industry and traditionally kicks of the carriers' reporting season, had
already warned it would be in the red during the three months, and more
optimistic comments about prospects ahead helped its shares to gain Dollars
1 1/8 yesterday at Dollars 62 1/8 .
Mr Michael Durham, finance director, said the recent firming of fare levels
made the outlook 'somewhat brighter than a few weeks ago', but he declined
to speculate on when AMR might return to profitability. He noted an autumn
fare promotion covered tickets for travel through much of the fourth
quarter, retarding recovery.
Shares in American's competitors also rose on the news. Delta gained Dollars
 3/4 at Dollars 59. UAL, parent of United Airlines, added Dollars 1 1/2 at
Dollars 120 1/8 .
The loss takes AMR's total deficit after tax in the first nine months of
1992 to Dollars 231m. In the same period of 1991, the airline made a net
loss of Dollars 115m. Third-quarter revenues totalled Dollars 3.73bn, a 5.9
per cent increase on last year's figure, and for the nine months were
Dollars 10.82bn against Dollars 9.48bn.
In the third quarter, American's load factor - the percentage of seats
filled with paying passengers - advanced from 66.8 per cent a year ago to
72.3 per cent, reflecting the boost in passenger traffic generated by cheap
fares. But the 'break-even' load factor also increased 62 per cent to 72.5
per cent.
