FT  04 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: No quick fix, but a benefit to UK
industry


   From Dr GEOFFREY BROAD


Sir, Recent letters have highlighted the polarised opinions on the success,
or otherwise, of working practices in Japanese subsidiaries in the UK (July
19, and August 28/29). Both positions may, in fact, be accurate.
There is now general agreement that Japanese, like other foreign
multinationals, select strategies and methods to manage successfully the
interface between local human resources and production technology set in the
context of a changing international business environment. There are,
however, variations in the responses of local managers, workers and trade
unions to the application and adaptation of Japanese-style management. Why
then do 'traditional' low trust and adversarial attitudes appear evident in
some plants and not apparently in others?
We know that Japanese manufacturers undergo phases of organisational
development which may, in part, account for the variable performance and
employee attitudes. None of them can therefore expect to be completely
immune from some industrial relations problems associated with the
introduction of high employee participation systems which increasingly link
remuneration with close appraisal and team working. Such 'prototypes' have
important implications, not only for shop floor relations, but also in terms
of the propensity of local managers and supervisors to work with their
Japanese colleagues in participative modes.
'Japanisation' can never be simply a quick fix to the problems of British
industry. However, we need to explore further the dynamics of change in
these plants and more Japanese firms should assist by opening up research
access to allow detailed empirical investigations to take place.
