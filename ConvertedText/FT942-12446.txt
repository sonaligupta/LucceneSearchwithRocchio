FT  29 APR 94 / The Lex Column: US economy


After a first quarter disrupted by storm and earthquake it was anybody's
guess where the US growth rate was going to settle. At first glance,
yesterday's figure of 2.6 per cent looks on the low side, but there is
little in the detail to deflect the Federal Reserve from further tightening.
Admittedly first-quarter growth was fuelled by a build-up of inventories,
especially in the auto sector. That may not last. Net exports are a drag,
but that reflects economic weakness abroad. At home, consumer demand remains
quite strong. The slowdown in residential construction was almost certainly
weather-related. If one assumes government spending will recover in the
second quarter as it did last year, the growth rate could easily snap back
over 3 per cent. On top of that the GDP deflator is now back at 2.6 per
cent.
Small wonder the bond market turned down as it digested the figures. With
the long bond yield having fallen back to around 7.1 per cent, the recent
rally was due for a correction anyway. More striking is that the prospect of
higher short term interest rates did nothing to revive the dollar. The US
current account deficit and capital outflows as US investors diversify their
portfolios combine to hold it back. Currency investors who started the year
long must be losing heart. If they sell, the dollar could fall further. That
would only worry the bond market more.
