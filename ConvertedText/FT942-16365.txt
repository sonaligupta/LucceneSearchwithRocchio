FT  11 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Confused ideas about objectives of
human resource management (3)


   From Mr TOM BARRY


Sir, The notion of measuring 'better management-employee relations'
illustrates precisely why many HR professionals are not delivering:
(1) The HR function's objective must be to help a company achieve its
business strategy by maximising the performance of its employees. If
professionals believe better management-employee relations are a measure of
their function's success, they will never find a place on the board.
(2) The assumed validity of the notion of 'management-employee relations' is
indicative of the continuing prevalence of command-control management style.
In our experience, a manager who still considers himself a 'boss' will not
get the maximum out of people. A manager who says he wants to 'empower his
employees' will not get the maximum out of his team.
Why not? Because individuals empower themselves. And when do they empower
themselves? When they recognise the self-interest in the job they are
performing.
Individuals do not take a job just to further the business goals of the
company. They take a job to further their personal goals. Only when the two
coincide can a company hope to maximise the commitment of its people, and
thus facilitate the attainment of its business objectives. Tom Barry,
