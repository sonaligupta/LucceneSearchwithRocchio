FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Enterprise clarifies position on cash
alternative in Lasmo bid


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Enterprise Oil was forced to clarify comments about a possible cash
alternative to its Pounds 1.4bn bid for rival Lasmo yesterday as its share
price continued to slide, writes David Wighton.
In a statement requested by the Takeover Panel Enterprise said that, in the
light of press comment, 'it has made no decision, at this early stage of its
offer for Lasmo, about the possible introduction of a cash alternative, at
some later stage of the offer'.
A Reuters report had suggested that comments made by Enterprise had ruled
out any prospect of a cash alternative.
Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chairman and chief executive, had said:'I do
not see any need for it.'
Mr Hearne will be up against a seasoned bid campaigner in the form of Mr
Rudolph Agnew who is to become chairman of Lasmo with immediate effect.
Former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, Mr Agnew was to have taken over
from Lord Rees as chairman on May 24.
Lord Rees said that with his past experience Mr Agnew was 'ideally qualified
to help see off this unwelcome bid from Enterprise.'
Enterprise shares lost another 8p to 416p yesterday, as City concerns about
the bid grew, with the lack of a cash alternative drawing particular
criticism.
The shares are down 30p since the bid was unveiled cutting the value from
150p to around 138p per Lasmo share. Lasmo shares lost 7.5p to 149.5p.
