FT  27 MAR 92 / Observer: Hanson alumni


It's always worth keeping an eye on what happens to the former acquisition
chiefs in Lord Hanson's entourage.
Greg Hutchings (class of 83) is the obvious star. He has taken Tomkins into
the FT-SE 100 and his company now sports a much racier share rating than
Hanson. John Newman (class of 77) is doing a reasonable job at TT Group, and
the smart money at Han-
son is on Philip Turner (class of 87) currently running Wassall with Chris
Miller, one of his lordship's old personal assistants. Now another Han- son
alumnus, Andrew Arends, has popped up as business development director of
Bunzl.
It is not a main board appointment, but then Arends - Oxford, Financial
Times and Harvard Law School - is far younger than the rest having just
turned 30.
Recruited by Lord White, he served on Hanson's Consolidated Gold Fields and
Beazer acquisition campaigns. However, he was moved side-
ways on the arrival of Chris Collins - he of the ICI idea.
Students of form might think that if Arends is as good as he sounds, then he
could have done better than embattled Bunzl. However, he still has time to
prove his mettle.
