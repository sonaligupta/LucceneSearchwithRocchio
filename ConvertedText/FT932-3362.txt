FT  15 JUN 93 / Mehta may turn state witness


   By REUTER


   NEW DELHI


MR Harshad Mehta, the flamboyant stockbroker at the centre of India's
biggest financial scandal, has offered to be a state witness and testify
about possible pay-offs to politicians, Reuter reports from New Delhi.
He would thus gain immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying
about a Rs10m (Pounds 210,000) political payoff, said Mr Ram Jethmalani, his
lawyer.
Mr Mehta, 38, has been charged with bribery, fraud and currency violations
in the scandal, which was exposed in April 1992. He is one of several
brokers and bankers accused of involvement in the scandal, in which money is
alleged to have been siphoned from the interbank securities market to help
pump up prices on the then booming Bombay stock exchange.
