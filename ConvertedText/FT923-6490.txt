FT  24 AUG 92 / Yorkshire textile group plans flotation


   By DANIEL GREEN


ONE OF Yorkshire's largest textile companies is planning the biggest textile
industry flotation on the London Stock Exchange for almost a decade.
Woolcombers Group is part of the Illingworth Morris Group, owned by Mr Alan
Lewis who acquired a majority stake in 1983 and took it private in 1989.
A pathfinder prospectus and share placing are planned for next month by the
company's broker James Capel.
Less than half the group is to be sold and the company is likely to have a
market capitalisation of Pounds 35m-Pounds 40m.
Three divisions of Illingworth Morris are to be floated under the
Woolcombers Group name: Jarmain, which processes UK wool mainly for carpets;
Woolcombers (Processors) which processes UK and southern hemisphere wools
for carpets and clothing, and Westbrook Lanolin which takes by-products from
the first two companies and refines them into pharmaceutical lanolin for
cosmetics, toiletry and medical products.
Illingworth Morris is one of 55 subsidiaries of Log Trust, a UK company 75
per cent held by Hartley Investment Trust, wholly owned by Mr Lewis, and 25
per cent held by an offshore trust of which Mr Lewis is the sole
beneficiary.
The remainder of Illingworth Morris consists of yarn, weaving and clothes
manufacturing operations as well as the Crombie brand name traditionally
associated with overcoats.
