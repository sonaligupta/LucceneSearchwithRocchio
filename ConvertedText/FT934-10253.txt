FT  06 NOV 93 / Solent fort sold after price cut


A CONVERTED Victorian fort in the middle of the Solent, with its own
lighthouse, helicopter pads, tennis court, indoor swimming pool and
gymnasium, has been sold after the asking price was cut by nearly Pounds 5m.
The price, paid by an anonymous overseas investor, remains confidential  -
however, agents Knight Frank and Rutley confirmed bids of Pounds 950,000 had
been asked for the No Man's Land fort off Portsmouth, which first went on
the market three years ago for Pounds 5.75m.
The fort was built in the 19th century as a defence against the French.
It was bought in a derelict state from the Ministry of Defence by a
developer who converted it into a 5-bedroom house.
