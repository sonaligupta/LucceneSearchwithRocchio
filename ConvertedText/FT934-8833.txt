FT  13 NOV 93 / Hope for power deal at Scots pit


   By JAMES BUXTON


SCOTTISHPOWER is understood to have reached an agreement with British Coal
which will involve the privatised power company continuing to take coal from
the Longannet deep mine in Fife after an existing agreement expires in 1995,
James Buxton writes.
ScottishPower agreed in 1991 to take between 2m tonnes and 2.5m tonnes of
coal a year from Longannet until March 31 1995. Earlier this year it said it
wanted to negotiate a new agreement so that both sides could take a
longer-term view of the future of coal supplies.
Yesterday Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, British Coal's head of operations, told union
leaders at Longannet that prospects for maintaining high volume sales from
the pit and from opencast sites looked promising. Negotiations with
ScottishPower were at an advanced stage, he said.
ScottishPower is expected to reveal details of the agreement with British
Coal on Tuesday.
