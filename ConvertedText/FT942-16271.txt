FT  11 APR 94 / Survey of Latin American Finance (19): Strong nerves called
for - Brady Bonds


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


Investors in Latin American Brady bonds will need strong nerves in the
coming months to cope with market volatility amid continued political and
economic uncertainty.
After last year's stellar performance, the region's markets have been
ravaged in the past two months by the sharp sell-off that has sent bonds
worldwide tumbling.
'Last year we saw the mother of all bull runs - followed by the mother of
all crashes,' says Mr Peter West, economic adviser at West Merchant Bank in
London. 'The sell-off wiped out a substantial proportion of the gains made
last year.'
After posting a record 43.87 per cent return in 1993, Brady bonds in the
year to March 24 fell by 14.48 per cent, Salomon Brothers' Brady Bond Index
shows. The Brady bond market comprises about Dollars 95bn of bonds converted
from loans under commercial bank restructuring agreements in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
The markets' initial slump was triggered by the US Federal Reserve's
monetary tightening on February 4, but exacerbated by adverse regional
developments, such as the Chiapas uprising in Mexico and the collapse of
Banco Latino, Venezuela's second-largest commercial bank.
The sell-off was further fuelled by heavy selling from highly leveraged
short-term participants - including the much-maligned hedge funds - facing
margin calls after losses in other markets.
'A big part of the rally last year was due to money flows from people who
were not very acquainted with, nor very dedicated to, this market,' says Mr
Marc Wenhammer, head of fixed-income at Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets,
who hold about Dollars 400m in Latin American bonds.
A second wave of selling was prompted by the assassination on March 23 of Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, Mexico's leading candidate for the presidential
elections. This put another damper on the Mexican bond market and its
neighbours and seemed to weaken the prospects for the long-awaited upgrading
of Mexico's credit rating. For months, bankers have been hoping that
Mexico's foreign debt rating will be raised to investment grade, from its
present sub-investment level. An upgrade would have significantly widened
the potential investor based for Mexican bonds.
Standard & Poor's recently affirmed its BB+ rating (one notch below
investment grade) and its positive rating outlook, but few expect an
upgrading this year. Moody's Investors Service rates Mexico's long-term
Eurobonds Ba2, two notches below investment grade, and its par and discount
bonds Ba3.
Faced with continued political and economic uncertainty and resulting market
volatility, investors have remained cautious. However, for now, few
observers see the threat of last year's heavy inflows being reversed this
year. 'The flows will tail off, but they will continue at lower rates,'
predicts Mr Paul Luke, senior economist at Morgan Grenfell.
Although some short-term participants and US mutual funds have pulled out,
longer-term investors, including insurance companies and pension funds, have
been reported to be testing the waters. Moreover, there is a feeling that
the next wave of buyers is not looking for a quick killing, but will need to
take a more realistic investment approach.
'The recovery will probably be more gradual, but also more stable,' says Mr
Luis Luis, chief economist for emerging markets at fund managers Scudder,
Stevens Clark in New York, who invest some Dollars 1.5bn in emerging bond
markets.
'I hope we'll get greater selectivity by more discerning investors,' says Mr
Wenhammer.
At present levels, Latin American Brady bonds look cheap. Moreover, the
ferocity of the recent sell-off has created anomalies in certain sectors
which offer 'a good buying opportunity for long-term investors', says Mr
Luis.
Take floating-rate bonds. Since their coupon is pegged to money-market
rates, floaters are usually protected from sharp jumps in long-term yields
and gain value when short-term rates rise. However, during the recent bond
market sell-off, Brady floaters fell sharply, effectively behaving like
long-dated fixed-rate bonds. With no fundamental changes to justify this
move, their slide was largely a function of supply and demand factors -
leveraged participants liquidating their positions. Thus, 'these bonds are
undervalued, and will increase in yield as rates rise', says Scudder's Mr
Luis.
Interestingly, even during the recent heavy sell-off, 'the market maintained
its ability to handle heavy flows', says Mr Joe Boyle, head of emerging
markets trading at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. Bid-offer spreads did
not widen significantly and there was no lessening in liquidity during the
turmoil. 'This testifies to the depth of the market.'
Still, the Colosio assassination sent shock waves through the markets which
are likely to reverberate in the region for some time. 'It increases the
perception that Mexico still has a long way to go in opening its political
system and dealing with social imbalances,' says Mr West at West Merchant
Bank. 'This may make some investors look at these markets with more caution
than before.'
'Mexico has always been regarded as a benchmark for the region - all the
other markets trade off it,' says another analyst. But while she expects the
neighbouring markets to track Mexican bonds, the increase in the political
risk could cause neighbouring markets' yield spreads over Mexican bonds to
tighten. 'The fundamentals in the other countries are still what they were
before the assassination.'
With sentiment shifting from the rampant optimism of last year to
overwhelming bearishness of late, good news has tended to be ignored, says
Mr West. However, 'once things settle down, people will focus on the
positive news', he predicts. These good tidings will include progress in the
the ongoing debt restructuring by countries converting their former bank
loans into Brady or Brady-style bonds.
Brazil is set to complete its Dollars 52bn debt restructuring by April 15,
making it the last of Latin America's big four debtor countries - the others
being Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina - to complete a Brady-style debt deal.
Brazil's bank creditors recently decided to go ahead with the restructuring
even though Brazil failed to win a standby loan accord from the IMF.
Next in line is Bulgaria, which is expected to exchange its debt by June 30.
Some say the deadline may be extended due to administrative delays, but most
market observers expect the deal to be completed later this year.
Among other ongoing Brady-type negotiations, Ecuador appears to be closest
to an agreement in principle, while Panama and Peru continue talking with
their creditors.
