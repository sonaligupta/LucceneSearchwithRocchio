FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood puts out its pathfinder prospectus


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


KENWOOD Appliances, the small kitchen equipment company purchased by
management from Thorn EMI in 1989 for Pounds 57m, yesterday published its
pathfinder prospectus for the flotation due on June 17.
The company, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 760,000
loss) for the year to March 31, is expected to be valued at about Pounds
100m, on a share price pitched between Pounds 2 and Pounds 3. The price
earnings ratio is likely to be about 16 times, compared with a consumer
index of over 17.
Some 40m to 45m shares are expected to be issued, representing approximately
half the total share capital, and will be divided equally between an
institutional placing and an open offer.
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said the group would use the proceeds of the
flotation to pay off its Pounds 40m bank borrowings. The 11 senior
management will hold about 8 per cent of the equity, including Mr Parker's 2
per cent.
Mr Parker said trading in the current year was going 'very well and our
prospects are excellent'.
The closing date for applications to the public offer is June 24. Dealings
are expected to begin on July 1.
