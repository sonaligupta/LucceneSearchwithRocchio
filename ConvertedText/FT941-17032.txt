FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: GBL rights issue makes
acquisitions likely


   By ANDREW HILL


Belgium's two largest holding companies are in the market for acquisitions,
after Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) yesterday launched a rights issue which
could raise BFr13.5bn (Dollars 251m) over the next five years.
A senior executive at GBL, Belgium's second-largest holding company, said
the cash would be used to increase stakes in favoured subsidiaries, back new
projects and seek out new purchases.
Last year Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company,
indicated that it was also back in the acquisitions game after four years of
cost-cutting and retrenchment.
La Generale raised BFr22.5bn in September with the sale of its 43 per cent
stake in CBR, its cement subsidiary, and offered a 12.5 per cent stake in
Union Miniere, the metals group, to the market in November, raising a
further BFr7bn.
Under the terms of the GBL rights issue, which runs for two weeks starting
on Friday, investors will be offered one new share and three warrants for
every 30 shares already owned.
Each share-and-warrant package has been priced at BFr4,600, raising BFr3.5bn
immediately. Those who subscribe will be able to exercise their warrants at
BFr4,400 a share up to the end of 1998.
GBL, which already has net cash of BFr5bn, owns large stakes in Petrofina,
the Belgian oil company, Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of Belgium's
big three banks, and CLT, the Luxembourg-based television, radio and media
group, among others.
Before the pricing was announced, GBL's shares closed at BFr4,080, up BFr45
on the day, and their highest price since 1990.
