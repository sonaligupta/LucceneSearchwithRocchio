economic data

Wall Street
US EQUITIES followed overseas markets higher yesterday, but investors
remained somewhat hesitant ahead of the US economic data slated for release
later this week, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 15.87 up at 3,230.99, while rises led
declines by 1,069 to 625 after turnover of 203m shares. The Standard &
Poor's 500 gained 1.68 to 406.89.
The equity rally came in spite of a dull treasury market, where the
benchmark 30-year bond fell  7/32 to 101 3/16 , yielding 7.89 per cent.
The transportation sector was particularly strong in the morning, with the
Dow Jones Transportation Average climbing 11.02 to 1,415.92 by 1pm before
receding to close only 3.17 ahead at 1,408.07. Delta Air Lines lost Dollars
 3/8 at Dollars 68 1/4 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, climbed Dollars 1
to Dollars 76 3/8 and CSX, the big US railroad company, shed Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 56 1/2 .
RJR Nabisco led trading for a second day on the NYSE, adding Dollars 1/4 at
Dollars 10 after analysts reiterated 'buy' recommendations on the issue. The
improvement came in spite of concern voiced by the American Medical
Association and the US Surgeon General over the company's Camel cigarette
advertising. Nabisco's critics believe that a cartoon character used in the
ads is more appealing to children than to adults.
AT&T appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 following an upgraded rating
from Brown Brothers Harriman.
Growth stocks such as Coca-Cola and Philip Morris gained momentum, rising
Dollars 1 to Dollars 81 1/8 and Dollars 1 to Dollars 77 respectively.
Travelers, one of the largest US composite insurers, firmed Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 20 after stating that it had added Dollars 300m to its capital base
through newly issued senior notes placed privately by Merrill Lynch. The
group, which has been hit by real estate investment problems, said the
proceeds will be added to the capital base of its principal life insurance
subsidiary.
In the secondary market, the Nasdaq composite index registered a rise of
7.64 to 623.46.
Strong fourth-quarter profits growth from Dell Computer, the fast growing US
personal computer manufacturer, helped the stock climb Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 39 1/4 . The company turned in net income of 62 cents a share in the
latest quarter compared with 42 cents a year earlier. Dell also declared a
three-for-two stock split.
High-tech stocks continued to lead trading in the secondary market. Lotus
Development rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO blue chips followed the upturn in New York, but the broad market
remained weak. A decline in the Canadian dollar raised short-term interest
rates and made the market nervous.
The composite index gained 11.3 at 3,529.9, but declining issues were ahead
of advances by 310 to 257. Volume came to 26.4m shares.
Shares of thinly traded Ford Motor of Canada fell CDollars 3 to CDollars
147. The Argentine Economy Ministry and Argentina's automakers denied a
report that negotiations are under way to import 65,000 cars from a Ford
plant in Canada.
International Corona ended at CDollars 3.65, off 10 cents. The company
announced several financing plans, including swapping preferred 'B' shares
for convertible debentures; a CDollars 50m common share offering; a new
USDollars 50m gold loan; and the possible sale of some non-core US gold
assets.
