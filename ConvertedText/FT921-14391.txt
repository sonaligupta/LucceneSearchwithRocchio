FT  16 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market report


   By REUTER


Aluminium bounced higher on the LME after a wave of buy stops were triggered
in the afternoon. Traders said that dealer buying and option covering took
three-month metal above Dollars 1,160 a tonne, touching off sizeable US
customer buy-stops. The rise accelerated sharply before sufficient profit
taking and hedge selling built up to prevent a close above the next
resistance point at Dollars 1,190. The move was seen as mainly technical,
and although it might still have a little way to run it would need the
support of consumers if it was to be sustained. And it was not likely they
would chase the market higher with so much surplus metal available, traders
said. Copper prices closed higher in the wake of aluminium. In contrast tin
bounced down to a new contract low of Dollars 5,485 a tonne for three-month
metal before buying re-emerged. Silver moved ahead on the London bullion
market after a day of active and volatile trade which moved the market onto
a positive chart footing. But one dealer said silver would have to breach
resistance at 425 cents a troy ounce to achieve a break through into a new
trading range. Silver dragged gold ahead, but producer selling was seen
capping rises at the upper end of the new range between Dollars 352 and
Dollars 358.
