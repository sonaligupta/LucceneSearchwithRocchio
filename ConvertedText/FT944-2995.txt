FT  15 DEC 94 / People: John Wardle


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT


John Wardle, an important figure in Midlands legal and corporate circles for
over 20 years, has died after becoming ill last week. His medical condition
had been fragile since a stroke in 1974.
He spent his career at Edge & Ellison, solicitors, finishing as senior
partner having helped to build the firm up into one of the leading regional
legal practices. But at the same time he was in demand as a company
director.
He served with quoted companies like Forward Group, Hampson Industries and
Metalrax and unquoted companies like JW Norton Services, Saville Barkers
Newsagents and Turbine Blading Group. As a chairman he specialised in
chatty, idiosyncratic statements.
