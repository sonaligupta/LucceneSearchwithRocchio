FT  15 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley endorses TUC-led campaign


   By DIANE SUMMERS


MR PETER Bottomley, the former Conservative employment minister, yesterday
backed a campaign led by the Trades Union Congress against a late House of
Lords amendment to the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, Diane
Summers writes.
The bill is due to be debated in the Commons today and tomorrow.
Mr Bottomley, MP for Eltham, said the amendment was an 'unbelievable
proposal' and was a 'direct attack on freedom of association' for union
members.
The amendment, which will strengthen employers' rights to derecognise unions
and introduce personal contracts, was introduced immediately after a Court
of Appeal ruling in April.
The court ruled that it was unlawful for employees to to be offered
financial inducements to give up their collective bargaining rights and sign
personal contracts. The latest employment bill amendment would reverse that
position.
The TUC said yesterday that it would complain to the International Labour
Organisation.
Mr Bottomley said Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, had not
sought such a measure. It was 'odd that anyone should try to be more
Thatcherite than Thatcher', he said.
Mr Michael Forsyth, a junior employment minister, said the amendment 'makes
clear that employers can pay more to secure changes in bargaining
arrangements, such as individual personal contracts or single-union
agreements'. Employees' rights to membership of unions were not affected, he
said.
