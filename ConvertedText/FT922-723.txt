FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tension clouds Ulster talks


   By RALPH ATKINS


SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, betrayed a growing tension
yesterday between the UK and Irish Republic over the 'round table' talks on
the province's future.
He expressed 'disappointment' at the delaying of a meeting expected this
week between the two governments.
But Sir Patrick told MPs that the time was not yet right for separate
negotiations planned between London and Dublin and Northern Ireland's
Unionist and nationalist politicians - a series of meetings that Mr David
Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, argues should have begun already. The
two ministers have not spoken since Monday.
The atmosphere of distrust may persuade Sir Patrick that early suspension of
the talks process may offer the best way of ensuring it can be resumed
later. The end of July has been set as the cut-off point.
Unionists are putting an increasing emphasis on the meeting between the two
governments - the 'third strand' of the talks process - where they hope
Dublin's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland will be discussed.
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party fears that Sir Patrick is
making too many concessions to the Unionists and reneging on his commitment
to start talks on relations between north and south Ireland within weeks of
the talks process beginning.
