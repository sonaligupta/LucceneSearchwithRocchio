FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: British Gas delists in Japan


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


The Tokyo stock exchange was presented yesterday with fresh evidence of
declining competitiveness when two more blue chip foreign companies
announced that they would delist.
British Gas and Scott Paper, the US personal paper products group, yesterday
asked to be delisted in Tokyo from December 31.
They cited the low volume of trading in their shares and the high costs of
maintaining a Japanese listing as the reasons. A Tokyo listing costs three
to four times as much as other leading markets, at Y15m to Y20m (Dollars
153,523-Dollars 204,697) a year, mainly for translating reports for Japanese
permits and observing regulations.
The companies' decision will bring to 17 the number of foreign companies to
have moved off the Tokyo stock market since the turn of the year, leaving 93
foreigners still listed.
At its peak three years ago, the number of foreign businesses listed in
Tokyo stood at 127.
British Gas, which received a Tokyo listing in 1988, said its move was part
of its effort to cut costs worldwide. Maintaining a listing in Japan was
more complicated than elsewhere, it added.
Scott Paper said it had no need to raise equity capital in Tokyo.
The exodus of foreign companies, plus heavy staff cuts among foreign banks
in Tokyo over the past year, has underlined how Tokyo's capital markets are
losing competitiveness to fast-developing financial centres in Asia and
rivals in the US and Europe.
