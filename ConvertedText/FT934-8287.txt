FT  16 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Swaps market may be bigger
than estimated


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE SWAPS market may be substantially larger than is generally recognised,
according to a survey of the world's leading derivatives dealers by Swaps
Monitor, a New York-based publication.
The survey says the size of the market stood at more than Dollars 7,000bn at
the end of 1992, substantially higher than the widely-quoted estimate of
Dollars 4,500bn given by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA), the industry's trade group.
The Swaps Monitor survey took the ISDA figure as a base and added the volume
of swaps by non-ISDA members and by ISDA members who did not participate in
the survey. The total is made up of Dollars 6,000bn in interest rate swaps
and Dollars 1,100bn in currency swaps.
Based on these figures, the capital requirement under BIS rules for the
world's commercial banks is estimated at Dollars 4bn for interest rate swaps
and Dollars 3bn for currency swaps.
The survey also used company results to rank the amount of swaps outstanding
on financial institutions' balance sheets (although variations in accounting
standards mean that banks from some countries, such as Japan, may be
under-represented).
According to the survey, JP Morgan has the highest level of outstanding
swaps, at over Dollars 450bn, followed by Paribas and Chemical. Of the top
10 dealers, seven are American and three French.
Barclays, the largest UK participant in the swaps market, comes eighth in
the table for interest rate swaps with Dollars 247bn.
The 10 largest dealers in interest rate swaps account for 49 per cent of the
total while the 10 largest currency swap dealers account for 40 per cent,
according to the survey.
