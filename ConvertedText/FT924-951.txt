FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Kennel talk


This Christmas why not splurge Dollars 3,800 on the dog that has everything
and buy Rover its very own copy of 'The European market for pet food and pet
care products'.
The good news in the Frost and Sullivan report is that pets should get more
to eat - the market is set to grow from Dollars 10.5bn to Dollars 11.6bn by
1996. The bad news is that the number of doggies is forecast to decline.
That's not what they want to hear at the kennels. Perhaps it would be better
to save this type of negative talk till after Christmas.
