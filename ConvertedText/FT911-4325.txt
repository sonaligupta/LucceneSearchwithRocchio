FT  19 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Kinnock accuses Tories of
'filching' policies - Party Campaigns


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, last night accused the Conservatives' of
'filching' his party's polices and protested that the Tories could not claim
to be the party both of good public services - and lower taxation, writes
Ralph Atkins.
As campaigning in the local elections intensified, Labour sought to hit back
at charges that it was a party of profligacy by attacking Mr John Major for
wanting the best of both worlds.
In a party political broadcast, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that
Britain could not afford to cut personal income taxation 'for a period of
years'. Investment had to proceed consumption.
Meanwhile the Conservative local election campaign remains low-profile -
with party officials seemingly unworried by Labour's determination to turn
the contest into an extension of the general election.
Senior MPs on the executive of the backbench 1922 committee told Mr Major
this week they would prefer an autumn election. Party managers received the
same message from a general canvass of MPs.
Tory MPs, however, used prime minsters' questions to respond to the launch
of Labour's 'opportunity Britain' policy document. They claimed the
Conservatives had created opportunities, such as in council housing, and
sought to score points over Labour's defence policy.
Speaking to Scottish trade unionists in Dundee, Mr Kinnock said the Tories
were 'filching Labour party policies on a grand scale'. He said they could
promise 'social Toryism' and 'hope that people will suspend their memories'.
Or they could promise to cut income tax to 20 per cent, 'and hope that
people will make a bonfire of their values'. They could not do both.
