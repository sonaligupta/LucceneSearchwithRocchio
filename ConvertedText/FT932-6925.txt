FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: Tougher competition hits profits
at NTT

NIPPON Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), Japan's privatised telecommunications
group, suffered a 29 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits, to Y247.2bn
(Dollars 2.25bn), for the year to the end of March. It said it faced intense
competition from newer entrants into the domestic telecommunications market.
The company came under increasing pressure from its competitors, forcing the
group to reduce some long-distance inter-city rates to maintain market
share.
Competition has been especially intense in the profitable routes between
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, where new private telephone service companies
already have more than 50 per cent of the market.
The effect of NTT's rate cuts showed through in its operating revenues,
which fell to Y5,892bn, down 2.7 per cent from the previous year.
Meanwhile, the weakness of Japan's economy led to a slowdown in telephone
subscriptions, NTT said.
In the face of a difficult business environment, the group has had to
maintain capital investment at high levels to modernise the telephone system
and invest in remote areas.
NTT's parent results were also affected by the separation of its mobile
communications business - one of the most profitable for the group - into a
separate company. This contributed to the overall fall in its operating
revenue.
In an effort to trim costs and raise profitability, NTT announced earlier
this year it would reduce its workforce by 30,000 over the next three years,
and cut its retail outlets by one-third. It is slashing management bonuses
and cutting recruitment by one-third.
NTT has also applied to Japan's ministry of posts and telecommunications for
permission to raise its phone rates.
NTT is forecasting a further fall in pre-tax profits, to Y149bn, in the
current year.
