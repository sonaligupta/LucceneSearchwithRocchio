FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Anheuser-Busch starts year on a
firm note


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


A surge in beer sales helped Anheuser-Busch, the biggest US brewer, report
an unexpectedly good start to the year yesterday.
After a long period of lacklustre volume growth and indifferent results,
first-quarter net income rose by 5.4 per cent from Dollars 194.1m to Dollars
204.4m. Anheuser-Busch said if its tax charge had not risen from 34 to 35
per cent, the profits rise would have been 7.1 per cent.
Fully-diluted earnings per share, boosted by an aggressive stock repurchase
programme, rose 10.1 per cent
Higher sales produced the profits growth, the company said. Turnover rose by
4.8 per cent to Dollars 3.02bn, with beer deliveries to wholesalers rising
by 4.4 per cent and sales to retailers - a more accurate indicator of
consumer demand - rising by more than 5 per cent.
Anheuser-Busch said the growth was led by Bud Light, one of the Budweiser
family of beers, which continued to grow at double-digit rates, and by Ice
Draft, a new type of beer brewed through an ultra-cold process. Ice Draft
had steadily gained market share since its launch in January, the company
said.
The company's market share rose by 1.1 percentage points to 44.3 per cent of
total US beer sales in the quarter, reaffirming its position as market
leader. It has held the number one slot since 1957.
Mr August Busch, chairman, said the company was extremely pleased with the
performance of Ice Draft and planned to introduce Ice Draft Lite in selected
markets in May. He looked forward to favourable demographic trends in the
company's market as the 'post baby boomer' generation reached legal drinking
age.
