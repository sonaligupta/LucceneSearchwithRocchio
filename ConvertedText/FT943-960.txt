FT  27 SEP 94 / Walker growth 'based on fraud'


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


The rapid expansion of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group,
throughout the 1980s was heavily dependent on the fraudulent profit-boosting
operation orchestrated by Mr George Walker, the company's former chairman
and chief executive, the prosecution in his trial alleged yesterday.
Mr Peter Rook QC told the Old Bailey that the fraud took place at a critical
phase of the company's development and had a substantial effect on how Brent
Walker was regarded by investors.
Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, a former Brent Walker finance director,
both deny charges of theft, false accounting and conspiring to falsify the
company's accounts.
Mr Rook said in his closing speech that comparisons of the Pounds 19m bogus
profits with the operating profits reported to shareholders showed how
important the fraud was to the company's expansion.
In 1984 the false profits were 25 per cent of Brent Walker's total operating
profits. In 1985 they were more than 80 per cent, in 1986 45 per cent and in
1987 more than 50 per cent.
Mr Rook said the evidence showed that Mr Walker had been the originator of
the fraud. Mr Walker had the contacts used for the bogus transactions and
money laundering operations and he had authorised crucial money transfers.
The trial continues today.
