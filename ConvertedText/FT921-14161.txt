FT  17 JAN 92 / TSB losses hit Pounds 47m on Hill Samuel debt charge


   By ROBERT PESTON


TSB Group yesterday announced a Pounds 47m loss for the year to October 31,
foreshadowing a series of results from UK banks which are likely to show
their worst domestic performance since they started to disclose figures
almost 20 years ago.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman, said that 'the economy has been the
roughest in living memory for the banks'. TSB's poor result stems from a
charge of Pounds 654m, which it has made to cover the risk of losses on bad
and doubtful debts. In 1990, TSB made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 312m.
However, the peak of TSB's losses was in the first six months of 1991, when
it made an overall loss of Pounds 150m, mainly because of disastrous figures
from Hill Samuel, its corporate banking division. The group returned to
profit of Pounds 103m in the second half.
Sir Nicholas also disclosed that the group has recruited a new finance
director, Mr John Burns, finance director of National Westminster Bank, to
replace Mr Dolf Mootham.
Mr Don McCrickard, TSB chief executive, said that last April Mr Mootham had
told the board he wanted to retire. In September, after talking to the Bank
of England, Mr McCrickard came to an arrangement with Mr Tom Frost,
NatWest's chief executive, that Mr Burns would move across, but that he
would not join until NatWest had found a replacement.
NatWest said yesterday it has appointed Mr Richard Goeltz, currently
executive vice-president of Seagram, the North American drinks company.
In spite of the losses, TSB is holding its dividend at 6.4p. It made a per
share loss of 3.5p, compared with the previous year's earnings of 13.4p. Its
share price rose from 120p to 128p.
