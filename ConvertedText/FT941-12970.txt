FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: General Dynamics shows
improvement


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


General Dynamics, the US defence contractor, yesterday revealed improved
fourth-quarter operating earnings in spite of a sharp downturn in revenues.
Net income on continuing operations was Dollars 64m, or Dollars 2.02 a
share, on sales of Dollars 779m. In the corresponding period of 1992,
comparable net earnings were Dollars 60m, or Dollars 1.93 a share, after
stripping out a Dollars 95m tax credit and an after-tax gain of Dollars 14m
on the sale of securities.
Earnings in the 1992 period were struck on sales of Dollars 911m. This was
about 13 per cent greater than the comparable 1993 figure.
Results for both periods exclude contributions by the company's space
systems division, which General Dynamics agreed last month to sell to Martin
Marietta for Dollars 208.5m in cash.
Mr James Mellor, president and chief executive, said the company's long-term
outlook had improved. 'Our low debt and year-end cash balance of Dollars
585m provide us with liquidity and financial capacity to build the value of
General Dynamics going forward,' he said.
For the full year, earnings from continuing operations were Dollars 270m on
sales of Dollars 3.2bn, compared with earnings of Dollars 305m and
marginally higher sales a year earlier.
Total net earnings in 1993 were Dollars 885m, including a Dollars 645m gain
on the sale of the aircraft business. In 1992, net earnings totalled Dollars
815m, including a gain of Dollars 374 on the sale of a variety of smaller
operations.
