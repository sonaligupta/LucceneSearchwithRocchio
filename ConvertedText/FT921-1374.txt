FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Noranda Forest sees higher
prices


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


NORANDA FOREST sees higher prices later this year for market pulp, wood
products, and many packaging products, but little recovery in newsprint and
fine papers.
However, operating rates should rise in all sectors, helping productivity
and bolstering cash flow, Canada's biggest forest products company said. The
outlook for 1993 is better.
Capital spending this year will be CDollars 350m (USDollars 292m), against
CDollars 284m in 1991, including CDollars 300m to bring Macmillan Bloedel's
mill effluent in British Columbia up to new federal environmental standards
for 1994-1995.
Noranda Forest says all its mills in eastern and western Canada will meet
the federal standards in time, but the big Northwood Pulp mill in British
Columbia will require major modifications to meet the province's latest
target of complete chlorine-free operation by the year 2002.
The British Columbia forest products industry is now in talks with the
government concerning this new target, saying that no technology yet exists
anywhere in the world to make compliance possible.
