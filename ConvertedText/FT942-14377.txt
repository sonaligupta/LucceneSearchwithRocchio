FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (6): The death knell may sound for first
class - Economic downturn has accelerated a trend


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


The skies are darkening for first-class air travel. Dutch carrier KLM and
Northwest Airlines of the US have become the latest airlines to abolish
first class cabins in favour of upgraded business ones on long-haul flights.
Flagging customer demand, prompted in part by the economic downturn but also
by the upgraded facilities being introduced in the business class sector,
have led nearly all the international airlines to review their first class
operations in the past two years. Not all that many have survived.
Luxury travel has been increasingly passed over by cost-conscious
travellers, with many big companies ordering their staff to book cheaper
seats as the recession has taken hold. The empty rows in first class have
prompted many airlines to create a middle class, and within that tier
further differentiation, by refurbishing their existing business facilities.
The effect has been a downward ratchet with many former first class
travellers unlikely to return, and a generation of prospective customers
satisfied in the cheaper business tier. For many airlines, a 5 per cent full
paying passenger load has become the norm in first class, with the remaining
seats filled by travelling airline crew or by upgrading business class
passengers.
With the quality gap closing between the middle and top tiers, the hefty
chasm between the respective fares looks all the more glaring. A first class
ticket between Chicago and Glasgow will cost in the region of Pounds 4,500,
whereas a business class fare comes in at around Pounds 2,500, with economy
at about Pounds 900.
However, the move away from first class travel is not simply a recent one.
The recession has accentuated a trend begun in the 1980s when attempts to
identify business travellers through a new range of branded products began
to pay dividend for airlines. As the range of brands proliferated, so too
did the fragmentation of the market, with first class pushed into an ever
smaller niche.
The first casualty were short-haul flights, with passengers rejecting the
luxuries and cost of first class for regional journeys. Last year, Swissair
became the last of the big airlines to offer a cheaper alternative to its
short-haul first class travel.
But it was the recession which sounded the death knell for first class. With
airlines plunging into losses throughout the world, the luxury services
proved the most costly to keep running and consequently the ones to receive
the severest cuts.
'There was hardly any demand,' says KLM. 'Business travellers want the
luxuries of first class but at a business class fare. That's what we're
going to give them.'
KLM and its US partner Northwest Airlines are abolishing their first class
tier and will offer passengers a choice between economy and a premium
service called world business class, an upgraded version of the old business
class service. The main feature of the new service will be increased leg
room. The only airlines offering more room to business class passengers will
be those that have already abolished first class travel - Virgin Atlantic of
the UK and Continental Airlines of the US.
British Airways is one of the few airlines to maintain a significant
presence in first class, although ironically it was the first to close down
its short-haul capacity. Mr Mike Batt, BA's marketing director, believes the
problem for most airlines is three-fold.
'An airline has to maintain a good load factor to make first class
economical, and for that it needs a good route network. Few airlines have
got the presence.
'Secondly, you need a strong branded product which customers can trust for
integrity and consistency. And most of all, you have to be able to deliver
that product.' For BA, integrity means few upgrades from business class.
'Upgrading devalues the product,' says Mr Batt.
So what do customers get for first class not available on other airlines'
premium brands? The lines of differentiation are getting increasingly
blurred. Executive lounges, extended leg room, wider chairs and personal
video are all offered in different measure by the premium services - and at
a cheaper price.
Mr Batt admits that first class is matched in many regards by other premium
services, but argues that the 'total travel experience' offered by the doyen
of air services is worth the extra expense.
'The first class traveller is someone who, because he is travelling a lot,
needs more than anyone to relax while he is doing it. If we can deliver a
busy executive overnight to a meeting the next day in a refreshed and
healthy state ready to do business, then first class travel is a wholly
justifiable business expense.'
First class makes up around 4 per cent of British Airways' revenue. And Mr
Batt believes that the move by other airlines away from the brand will draw
other passengers over to BA. 'There is a small but significant band of
regular travellers who are loyal to first class and do not want to fly
anything else.'
A typical BA 747 will contain around 300 economy class seats, 72-88 club
class and 18 or so first class. Other airlines with first class on their
747s are likely to offer far fewer seats. Even so, they have been finding
few takers and special deals proliferate, such as free second tickets for
spouses and discounts on future flights. Furthermore, plans being drawn up
for the new generation of 777 aircraft make no allowances for first class
cabins.
But BA intends to keep its first class product at the forefront of executive
travel. Later this year it plans to introduce its first aircraft to allow
first class passengers to send faxes, operate computers, receive E-mail and
make outgoing telephone calls. 'All our research indicates that our
customers do not want incoming calls,' says Mr Batt.
However, even bullish BA admits the future for first class is not
guaranteed. 'If the niche got too small, then we would have to look at our
options,' says Mr Batt. 'You have to be responsive and we will change with
the market.'
