FT  01 NOV 93 / Opec may revise pact on output


   By REUTER


   BAHRAIN


IRAN said yesterday that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would have to re-examine its September output agreement and cut its ceiling
if oil prices did not recover, Reuter reports from Bahrain.
'If the price weakens further, there should be a new discussion on the
ceiling,' Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, oil minister, said in a statement.
'If this (current) ceiling does not lead to stronger prices, there should be
a revision.'
It was believed to be the first open statement from within Opec that the
agreement, which set a ceiling of 24.52m barrels per day for October to
March, might need revision.
Opec members have looked in dismay as the market has chipped tens of
millions of dollars off their collective daily revenue.
North Sea Brent prices fell below the Dollars 16 per barrel level on Friday.
The price for December delivery closed in London at Dollars 15.80.
