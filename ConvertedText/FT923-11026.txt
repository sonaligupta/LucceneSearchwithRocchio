FT  27 JUL 92 / Observer: Austracised


Australia's simmering republicans are sharpening their claws. They have
discovered that acetate - commonly found in nail varnish remover - can be
used to remove the Queen's portrait from the plastic five dollar note issued
earlier this month. Some are replacing the portrait with slogans such as
'Republic now' and 'Caroline Chisholm Rules]', a reference to the 19th
century pioneer whose portrait appeared on an earlier design.
Leaders of the Australian Republican Movement seem unsure how to react.
Author Thomas Keneally is carefully sitting on the fence; he understands why
activists are defacing the notes, but wouldn't do it himself, he says.
Ironically, Chisholm was an Englishwoman who spent only a few years in
Australia before returning to England where she is buried.
