FT  23 JUL 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric income
slips to Dollars 75m


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Westinghouse Electric, the struggling US conglomerate, yesterday reported a
fall in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 75m from Dollars 84m, for the
second quarter.
Revenues slipped from Dollars 2.15bn to Dollars 2.11bn.
Broadcasting, Thermo King, energy systems and WCI Communities were the only
divisions to improve their contributions to operating profits. Electronic
systems, government and environmental services, power generation, Knoll and
other businesses were all down.
Mr Mike Jordan, chairman and chief executive, said the results were slightly
above expectations. He said the company would accelerate its cost-reduction
programmes as part of continuing efforts to improve overall performance.
In May, he predicted that growth in earnings per share would reach 15 to 20
per cent over the next three years.
Operating profits fell to Dollars 154m from Dollars 185m in the ond quarter,
giving an operating profit margin of 7.3 per cent against 8.6 per cent last
time. Earnings per share fell to 16 cents from 20 cents. First-half net
income fell to Dollars 111m from Dollars 143m, before accounting changes.
Mr Jordan said employees had been reduced by 4 per cent - about 2,000 -
since the end of last December. 'These costs will continue to come down
significantly throughout 1994 and 1995,' he said.
Among the better-performing divisions, broadcasting lifted revenues by
Dollars 10m and operating profits by Dollars 8m. Thermo King revenues rose
Dollars 37m and operating profits Dollars 3m.
Westinghouse Communities, the property development side, lifted revenues by
Dollars 25m to Dollars 74m and operating profits by Dollars 11m to Dollars
24m.
