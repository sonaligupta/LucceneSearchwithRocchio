FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Strong profits recovery at
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez

Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French utilities and communications group,
announced a strong recovery in profits in 1993 and said it plans to
restructure its construction and public works activities to strengthen their
position in international markets.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said that preliminary results showed net profits
of FFr800m (Dollars 93m) last year, more than double the FFr379m achieved in
1992 but still below the FFr1.17bn recorded in the previous year. Turnover
rose by about 3.5 per cent to FFr93.6bn.
According to Mr Monod, the improvement in results and signs of recovery in
the construction sector helped explain the group's decision to merge the
building and public works activities of its Dumez and GTM-Entrepose
subsidiaries.
The combined company, to be called Dumez-GTM, will have annual sales of
about FFr25bn and a workforce of about 35,000. According to the chairman, it
should allow the group to compete more effectively for significant
infrastructure and public works contracts expected in France, Europe and
south-east Asia. Industry observers, however, expressed caution about the
benefits.
Mr Andre Jarrosson, chairman of GTM-Entrepose, said the reorganisation
should be completed by the summer. Under the terms of the proposed
restructuring, Dumez-GTM will be held 50-50 by GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez will continue to hold 60 per cent and 100 per cent
respectively of GTM-Entrepose and Dumez.
The group said no job cuts would be involved in the reorganisation, and
there would be no direct effects on the consolidation and reporting of
earnings. GTM Entrepose, which also has non-construction activities such as
engineering and offshore contracting, will retain its market listing.
Shares in GTM-Entrepose fell by FFr28 to FFr480, reflecting concerns about
the possible impact on minority shareholders and a reduction in net profits,
from FFr202m in 1992 to FFr170m last year. By contrast, Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez exceeded market expectations with its turnround from 1992,
pushing shares up FFr8 to FFr592.
