FT  15 APR 94 / European Commission's green paper on social policy


   By DAVID GOODHART


European Union social policy should concentrate on disseminating best
practice 'rather than choking off job creation and hindering EU
competitiveness', according to the government's formal response to the
European Commission's green paper on social policy, David Goodhart writes.
The green paper, published at the end of last year, should not form the
basis of a new round of social leglislation, says the response.
Presenting the document last night, Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary,
said all future action by the community must respect the deep-seated
diversity of national traditions and institutions.
Social policy should focus on:
Support for member states' efforts to improve the functioning of their
labour markets.
Making a reality of existing treaty rights.
Effective implementation and enforcement of existing measures.
Mr Hunt said the EU had a 'vital role' to play in ensuring that 'expertise
gained in the various member states in dealing with problems of employment,
unemployment, employee relations, and equal opportunity is widely
disseminated'.
