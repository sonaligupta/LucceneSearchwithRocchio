FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia Invs falls to Pounds 34.7m


   By ROLAND RUDD


CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds a 46.2 per cent
stake, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 35.3m) for the
year to March 31.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the company was affected by falling
interest rates as it switched from British & Commonwealth Holdings
preference shares and cash deposits to other investments.
Caledonia is proposing to buy up to 10 per cent of its shares at 355p each -
a small premium to Wednesday's closing price. The shares yesterday rose by
23p to 362p.
The final dividend of 9.6p takes the total for the year to 14.4p (13.5p) on
earnings of 24.1p (25p).
