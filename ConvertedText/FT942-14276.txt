FT  21 APR 94 / Germans in talks to rescue Lancer Boss


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Jung Heinrich, the Hamburg-based lift-truck producer should be ready next
week to bid for the UK operations of its rival Lancer Boss, Mr Bob Bischof,
chairman of Jung Henirich (GB), said last night.
Mr Bischof spent yesterday at the Lancer Boss UK headquarters in Leighton
Buzzard, Bedfordshire, in discussions with Grant Thornton, which earlier
this month was appointed administrative receiver for the UK operations.
Last week Jung Heinrich bought Steinbock Boss, Lancer Boss's German unit
from a German receiver and discussions yesterday focused on the continuing
trading relationship between Lancer Boss and Steinbock Boss, whose product
ranges are inter-related. Mr Allan Griffiths, one of the UK receivers, said
last week that this relationship needed to be sorted out before he could
sell Lancer Boss - whether to Jung Heinrich or to other potential
purchasers.
Mr Bischof has been brought out of semi-retirement to handle the
negotiations with Grant Thornton and he will remain closely involved if Jung
Heinrich buys Lancer Boss.
Begbies, the London accountants, is also seeking an administration order
from the High Court in respect of another Lancer Boss unit, Toddington Manor
Farms in Bedfordshire.
Begbies was appointed as 'law of property act' receivers by National
Westminster Bank over the parts of Toddington Manor Farm that are collateral
for a loan from the bank to Boss Trucks, a Lancer Boss UK unit.
Mr Nicholas Hood, a partner at Begbies, said it had applied for the
administration order so it could take control of the farm's assets and sell
the farm as a going concern.
