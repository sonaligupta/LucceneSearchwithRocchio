FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: No time to shout foul


   From Mr HUGH ALDOUS


Sir, Mr Allister Wilson's article ('Closing the gaps between expectation and
reality', June 25) is good - although he could have said it in four
sentences instead of 54. However, the accountancy profession would be larger
in stature if it admitted that all these matters have been well known for 20
years. For most of that time it suited the profession that accounts had
little meaning other than a consequential one and no one knew what an audit
was supposed to be. The fact that public disquiet and some huge legal
actions mean that this state of affairs no longer suits the profession is
hardly the best reason to shout 'foul - someone else should do something'.
