FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Time Warner to launch NY channel


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


TIME WARNER, the US media and entertainment group, plans an autumn launch of
the first round-the-clock cable news channel that is specifically focused on
news in New York City.
The new channel, to be known as New York 1 News, is part of the company's
expansion of its cable operations, which are the second largest in the US.
Fewer than 1m of Time Warner's nearly 7m national cable subscribers will be
able to see the channel.
The launch of the new channel has been put off until September because of
problems related to the site chosen for its Manhattan headquarters.
New York is one of the most profitable cable franchises in the US, and Time
Warner has a number of expansion plans for the metropolitan area.
It recently started a 150-channel cable facility in the Queens section of
New York and has been stepping up the development of pay-per-view movie
channels.
