FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Foreign chip sales up in Japan

Non-Japanese semiconductor manufacturers gained a record 23.2 per cent of
the Japanese chip market in the third quarter, up from 18.1 per cent in the
same period last year, US and Japanese government officials reported
yesterday. The rise should help defuse tensions between Washington and Tokyo
over the long-running chip trade battle. In previous trade agreements, the
US and Japan agreed to a target 20 per cent foreign share of Japan's market
for semiconductor products. Before the first agreement in 1986, the foreign
share stood at 8.5 per cent.
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, welcomed the increase in foreign
market share calling it a 'a very positive development' that showed the
success of a results-oriented agreement but he warned against 'backsliding'.
The Japanese market, which accounts for about one third of world chip sales,
is expected to be worth almost Dollars 30bn this year, according to industry
statistics. 'There is no doubt that the trade agreements have produced
results,' said Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry
Association, a US industry trade group.
