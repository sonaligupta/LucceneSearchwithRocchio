FT  28 APR 94 / Pounds 76m aid urged for Ukraine


   By LIONEL BARBER

The European Commission has drawn up plans for Ecu100m (Pounds 76.7m)
emergency food aid to Ukraine. The move is in response to a crisis in farm
production and distribution which has turned Ukraine, the former breadbasket
to Russia, into a net food importer. The Commission warned yesterday that
shortages of seeds, fertiliser, fuel and investment in farm equipment have
caused chaos in the Ukrainian food supply and increased the threat of social
unrest.
The food aid plan is part of a new European 'action plan' for the Ukraine
which requires approval from the 12 EU member states. The Commission plan
also attempts to tackle the crisis in Ukraine's energy sector. One idea is
that the EU, backed by international donors, should help to complete two new
nuclear reactors at Rovno and Khemelnitzky, conditional on the Kiev
government dropping opposition to shut down the Chernobyl plant. The
Commission made clear that it views the proposals as a test of the EU's
nascent common security and foreign policy. Other plans include closer
political contacts to consolidate democracy and human rights, improving
strained relations between Ukraine and Russia, and strengthening Ukraine's
'independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.'
