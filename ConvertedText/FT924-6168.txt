FT  23 NOV 92 / Observer: Merck ado


Once upon a time it was bankers who were always falling out with each other
on who was the biggest in the world. Now Observer hears that corporate egos
at Merck have been dented following a report suggesting the US group had
been stripped of its title as the world's biggest drugs company.
Scrip Reports, a highly respected UK-based market research company, reckons
Merck's arch-rival, Glaxo of the UK, has overtaken it in terms of
pharmaceuticals sales. According to Scrip, Glaxo's turnover was Dollars
7.247bn last year compared with Merck's Dollars 7.225bn, giving the British
group a margin of victory of Dollars 22m.
Officially, Merck says size doesn't matter. Besides, it's still more
profitable than Glaxo. But privately it's more than irritated. The group is
now challenging Scrip's methodology, although it has never done so before.
Glaxo is clearly pleased by the figures although it is playing them down.
But with sales growth of 19.5 per cent last year, compared with Merck's 13.5
per cent, it is only a matter of time before Glaxo assumes the title
officially.
