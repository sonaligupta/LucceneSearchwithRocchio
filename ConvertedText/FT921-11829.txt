FT  30 JAN 92 / Kohl will sign pact with Prague


   By QUENTIN PEEL


CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will travel to Prague at the end of next month to
sign a controversial co-operation treaty with Czechoslovakia, in spite of
strong conservative opposition in Germany.
The treaty was approved by the German cabinet yesterday, along with a
similar treaty with Hungary - but only after the chancellor had given the
assurance that he would raise the question of property rights for former
Sudeten Germans on his trip to Prague.
Properties once owned by Germans in the former Sudetenland are currently
being sold off, according to reports in Germany, and the former owners are
demanding a right to participate.
The issue has caused an embarrassing delay in ratifying the friendship
treaty.
Mr Kohl has already agreed to support a joint resolution in the Bundestag
backing the property claims of the Sudeten Germans, but has refused to agree
to any changes in the treaty itself.
