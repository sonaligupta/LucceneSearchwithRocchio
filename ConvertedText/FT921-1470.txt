FT  24 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's bumper tea crop


   By KUNAL BOSE


   CALCUTTA


INDIA'S 1991 tea exceeded the target by more than 6m kg to reach 741.7m kg.
In 1990 production was 714.7m kg.
Last year's rise was achieved in the face of serious problems on the Assam
tea estates, which account for more than 52 per cent of national output,
posed by the militant activity of the United Liberation Front of Assam and
the Bodos tribe, which is fighting for a separate state within Assam.
While Assam's crop rose nearly 8m kg to 388m kg, the rest of the north
Indian crop advanced by 4.5m kg to 168.8m kg. Although management was
severely hampered in many Assam tea gardens, quality was generally up to the
mark.
Aided once again by favourable weather, South India raised its tea crop by
14.5m kg to 185m kg, following 1990s spectacular rise of 18.7m kg.
For the same reason, the Sri Lankan tea crop increased last year by 7.5m kg
to 240.7m kg.
The share of CTC (cut tear and curl) and orthodox teas in the Indian total
was is 578m kg and 155.4m kg respectively. Miscellaneous varieties
constituted the balance of 8.3m kg.
According to Mr Vijay Dudeja, spokesman for the industry, in spite of the
former Soviet Union buying only 109.6m kg (repeat 109.6m kg) of Indian tea
in 1991, compared with 124.32m kg in the previous year, total Indian tea
exports rose to 203.57m kg from 199.66m kg. That was because India was able
to step up tea exports to hard currency countries to 87.87m kg from 66.66m
kg. The UK bought 23.84m kg, up from 22.24m kg, while Iran, West Germany,
Ireland, the Netherlands, the US, Egypt and Saudi Arabia all bought more
Indian tea.
The Indian tea industry, according to Mr Dudeja, earned lower profits in
1991 because prices lost ground. Compared with Rs43.27 (90p) a kilogram in
1990, the average auction price realisation last year was Rs40.31 a
kilogram. Lower Soviet purchases and the reluctance of the trade to maintain
stocks because of high interest rate were responsible for the price falls.
