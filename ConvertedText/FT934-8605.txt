FT  15 NOV 93 / Gas-heated homes are 'more green'


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


A NEW all-electric house generates about four times as much carbon dioxide
as one heated by gas, according to the Association for the Conservation of
Energy.
A study from the group, which acts as the trade association for the energy
efficiency industry, says: 'From the point of view of emissions, the
environmental case against all-electric houses is overwhelming.'
Even in the most efficient cases, burning gas in the home generates heat at
an efficiency of 70 per cent while gas burnt to generate electricity which
is then used to heat the home achieves an overall efficiency of only 40 per
cent.
It says most of the competitiveness of electricity is based on other
factors, such as subsidised connection charges, and the economics of
all-electric houses 'are dubious at best'.
