FT  28 APR 94 / Observer: Drug drag


While its dealers may relax with heavy metal, Lehman Brothers as a company
is apparently more in tune with heavy paper.
Its forthcoming survey of the world's pharmaceutical industry, called
PharmaPipelines, weighs in at 1.8 kg, only fractionally less than the
mammoth 2.2 kg Yellow Pages telephone directory for London.
The result of the efforts of 11 stockmarket analysts and some powerful
computer software, it is somewhat lacking in the narrative drive department.
But it's got to be a best-seller for investors in the pulp and paper
industry.
