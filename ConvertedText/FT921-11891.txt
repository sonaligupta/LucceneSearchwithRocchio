FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Brandon Hire warns of second half loss


The shares of USM-quoted Brandon Hire slipped 4p to 34p yesterday on news of
a fall from Pounds 354,000 to Pounds 23,000 in pre-tax profits for the six
months to October 31. Turnover fell by 21 per cent to Pounds 2.19m.
The second half is traditionally less profitable and directors said a loss
for the period was likely.
In order to preserve cash within the business they are cutting the interim
dividend from 1.11p to a nominal 0.1p. Earnings fell by 2.07p to 0.23p.
Cost controls enabled Brandon to reduce first half borrowings by 15 per cent
and gearing by 7 per cent to 38 per cent.
