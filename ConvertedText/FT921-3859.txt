FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Toys 'R' Us boosts sales and
profits

   NEW YORK


TOYS 'R' Us, the large specialist toy retailer, yesterday reported an 11.1
per cent sales increase to Dollars 6.12bn for the year to February 1, and
after-tax profits for the 12 months of Dollars 339.5m.
This compares with sales of Dollars 5.51bn in the previous year, and net
profits of Dollars 326m.
Earnings per share increased only marginally, up from Dollars 1.11 in
1989/90 to Dollars 1.15 last year. That was in line with analysts'
estimates, although the shares eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34 5/8
yesterday.
Mr Terrence McEvoy, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said: 'The
company indicated in its conference call that its electronic games category
would be flat to slightly up this year.'
He said that comment was likely the factor hurting the stock because
'earnings were right on target'.
In the fourth quarter alone - the key Christmas sales period - Toys 'R' Us
made an after-tax profit of Dollars 261.6m, up by just over 10 per cent on
the previous 12 months, on sales of Dollars 2.86bn up from Dollars 2.55bn.
Part of the growth comes from the steady expansion of the chain. Some 46
stores opened in the US last year, taking the total there to 497, and 29 new
outlets were introduced internationally. The group now has 126 stores
outside the US.
Toys 'R' Us said that same-store sales, which offer a better measure of
underlying growth, rose by 7.4 per cent in the fourth quarter but only 2.4
per cent for the year overall.
Yesterday, the group said that it plans to add 40 stores internationally
this year - going into Austria for the first time - and a slightly larger
number in the US.
About six of the new stores will be in the UK, where Toys 'R' Us currently
has 33 outlets.
