FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Improved production helps Aviva cut losses
to Dollars 2.63m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Aviva Petroleum, the small US-based oil and gas explorer, quoted in the UK,
yesterday announced sharply lower net losses of Dollars 2.63m (Pounds 1.8m),
against Dollars 10.23m last year, because of improved production from the
group's Colombian project.
The better result was achieved on virtually static oil and gas sales of
Dollars 10.68m, against Dollars 10.42m last time.
The loss per share was reduced from 124 cents to 11 cents. As in the past
there is no dividend.
Mr Ron Suttill, chief executive, said he was confident the group would be
able to achieve profits in spite of a depressed oil price.
Aviva was aiming to break even by the end of the current year, he said.
He stressed the potential of further development of the Colombian project,
jointly owned with Ecopetrol, the state energy company.
By 1995 Aviva hoped to earn some 24,000 barrels a day from its share of the
Colombian fields, which would result in a net cash flow contribution of
about Dollars 12m a year, Mr Suttill said.
Net production from Colombia increased by 54 per cent to 279,000 barrels
during the year. Mr Suttill said the increase, combined with a 10 per cent
rise in US gas prices, more than offset a decline in oil and gas volumes in
the US and reductions in the US and Colombian oil price. Currently all of
Aviva's Colombian production is sold to Ecopetrol.
