FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Former Davy holders warned on payment


   By ROLAND RUDD


TRAFALGAR House, the cons-truction and shipping conglomerate, yesterday
warned former shareholders in Davy Corporation that they were no closer to
getting their second payment, totalling Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, despite
a recent favourable ruling in the High Court, writes Roland Rudd.
The warning comes as it was revealed that the conglomerate is considering
leasing the Ocean Emerald oil rig to Midland and Scottish Resources.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chairman, in a letter to former Davy
shareholders, said 'it still seems unlikely' that the necessary conditions
would be in place enabling them to get their second payment.
Former shareholders in Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar took over last
June, expected to get their second payment, after the conglomerate won an
important ruling in its battle with MSR over payment for the Ocean Emerald.
The ruling stipulated that Trafalgar could keep control of the rig until it
was able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's
bankers or it was paid in full by MSR.
If Trafalgar leases the rig to the MSR, it may improve the chances of
drawing the letter of credit. However, Sir Eric has warned that the second
payment could still be a long way off since it might not be able to draw on
the letter of credit because of MSR's refinancing of the contract.
The Takeover Panel yesterday announced that the statements made by Trafalgar
relating to the second payment in its original offer document for Davy did
not create a misleading impression.
However, it added that Trafalgar had a 'continuing obligation to use all
reasonable endeavours to obtain payment' so former Davy holders could
receive their second payment.
