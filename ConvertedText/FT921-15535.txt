FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: Spelling mistake


It is not the best advert for Made in Britain. Yesterday's Walworth Road
hand-out launching the Labour party's economic strategy for the 1990s
included about a dozen spelling and other grammatical mistakes in the course
of a two-page press release. Of course, it may be all the fault of the 13
years of Tory neglect of Britain's education system. Even so, a modest
investment in a computer spell-check system would not go amiss, especially
when the statement is issued on behalf of the shadow chancellor.
