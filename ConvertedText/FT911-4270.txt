FT  20 APR 91 / UK asks Japan for more pension, insurance reform


   By ROBERT THOMSON

THE British government has asked Japan for further reforms to the country's
pension fund and insurance industries, and has emphasised to Japanese
institutions that their UK operations are regarded as members of Britain's
'home team'.
Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, said yesterday that
discussions with Japanese officials this week confirmed that progress has
been made in liberalising the financial system, though this remains 'slow'.
He had asked Japanese officials to consider further changes to regulations
on pension funds, on which the government has taken only the 'first steps'
of reform.
Last April, the Japanese government allowed investment advisory companies,
including 36 foreign ones, to handle limited amounts of new money flowing
into Japan's pension system.
Mr Redwood asked Japanese officials to increase the opportunities for
foreign companies to manage money, and to ease restrictions on the types of
investments.
There is already a debate within Japan's Finance Ministry over the measuring
of pension fund performance. Mr Redwood said British companies could find
openings in performance analysis.
During his meetings, he raised the problems that Fujitsu, the Japanese
computer company, has faced since its purchase last year of ICL, which has
been expelled from some European joint research projects.
He emphasised that the UK businesses of Japanese institutions are regarded
as the 'home team'; their interests would be defended in Europe.
