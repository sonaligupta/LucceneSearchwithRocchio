FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour broadcasts its national health warning


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


LABOUR'S election broadcast last night appeared to be something of a mystery
to the party's press office.
The broadcast, scenes of which are shown below, showed a young girl in pain
waiting for a National Health Service ear operation while another girl,
whose mother writes a Pounds 200 cheque, receives private treatment.
The only available details were that the director was Mr Mike Newell, who
has made advertisements and 'small films'; that the song used, Someone
Really Loves You, was a cover version of a BB King song; and that the two
girls were actresses. Production was thought to have been completed 'quite
recently'.
Labour's press office said that the broadcast's message was 'prompted by a
letter from a father whose daughter had to wait 11 months' for a quite
common childhood problem known as 'glue ear', which is painful and affects
hearing.
But officials said it was not an exact re-enactment of the case.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, says in the film: 'If the Conservatives
win, they will continue to privatise the NHS and make it more like the
American system.'
The broadcast opens with the words: 'The story of two girls with the same
problem - one can afford private treatment, the other can't' It ends with
the message: 'It's their future, don't let it end in tiers.'
