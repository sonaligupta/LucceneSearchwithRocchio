FT  05 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Good news at last - New issues


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Midland Independent Newspapers pitched in this week with what appears to be
a significant opportunity for investors to take advantage of recovery in a
severely depressed advertising market. The group announced a flotation price
of 140p, valuing the regional newspaper publisher at Pounds 193m.
The historic price to earnings ratio of 19.5, based on a full tax rate of 33
per cent, compares favourably with both the sector average of 29.9 times and
multiples of comparable groups such as Trinity International and Johnston
Press.
MIN has won praise for its performance during recession. Since the Pounds
125m management buy-out in 1991, margins have more than doubled from 9 per
cent to 21 per cent. But the improvements may leave potential investors
wondering if most of the benefits of revitalising the group and improving
margins have been absorbed already.
Indeed, this is likely to be the case, except with newly-acquired titles
which offer scope for improvement in the short term.
MIN's main appeal lies in its exposure to classified and, in particular,
recruitment advertising. Even small increases in volumes are expected to
fall straight through to profit.
Longer-term questions centre on MIN's underlying potential in a historically
declining market. Regional newspapers are losing ground steadily to other
media in terms of both audience and their share of the advertising market.
Much will depend on MIN developing new opportunities. Meanwhile, the price
announced this week leaves many convinced the shares will trade on a premium
for the short to medium term.
