FT  16 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates unchanged


   By SIMON LONDON


UK SHORT money rates eased for a while yesterday before closing little
changed, as sterling gained ground against a weaker D-Mark on the foreign
exchange markets, writes Simon London.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.15bn liquidity shortage during early
morning, later revised to Pounds 1.25bn. The main factors contributing to
the squeeze were exchequer transactions totalling Pounds 735m and maturing
assistance from previous sessions of Pounds 288m.
In early assistance, the Bank of England relieved some of the pressure,
injecting Pounds 489m through a small outright purchase of band 1 bills at
10 7/8 per cent and the purchase of Pounds 475m paper for resale to the
market on February 3 at 10 7/16 per cent.
Later in the morning a further Pounds 150m was bought for resale on the same
date and on the same terms. Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of
Pounds 342m band 1 and band 2 bills at 10 3/8 per cent.
Late assistance amounted to Pounds 290m, bringing the total liquidity
injection for the day to Pounds 1.27bn.
The unsecured overnight money rate traded mostly at 10 5/8 - 1/2 per cent in
the morning session, the same as Tuesday's closing level, but was down to 9
per cent during the afternoon as the liquidity injection took effect.
The March short sterling contract on the London International Financial
Futures Exchange streng-thened through the day, reaching 89.69 by the close,
from 89.62 on Tuesday. This level implies base rates of 10.31 per cent by
the spring, from a current rate of 10.5 per cent.
In Frankfurt, the Bundesbank relieved pressure for higher money market rates
at its repurchase operation. Faced with maturing repurchase pacts totalling
DM33.8bn, the Bundesbank injected a total of DM41.1bn.
This comprised DM31.1bn paper for resale in 35 days time at 9.4 per cent and
DM10bn for resale in 63 days at the same rate.
The net injection of DM7.3bn had only a marginal effect on money market
interest rates. Call money traded at around 9.45/55 per cent, down from
9.55/60 on Tuesday. In Paris, call money rates eased  3/16 point to 9 3/4 to
9 7/8 per cent, encouraged by the strength of the French franc against the
D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism, which may give the
French authorities more room to lower lending rates.
