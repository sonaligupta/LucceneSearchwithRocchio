FT  13 NOV 92 / People: Sherlock joins Allied Leisure


Peter Sherlock, whose abrupt departure as an executive director of Bass last
month surprised the stock market, is returning to an industry he knows well,
as a non-executive director of Allied Leisure.
Sherlock, 47, played a key role in building up Bass's leisure division,
before moving over to the company's Holiday Inns hotel operations in
Atlanta. There has been little comment on Sherlock's reasons for quitting
Bass, where he was regarded as one of the young high fliers, but analysts
have speculated that whereas he was running Bass's leisure business, he was
only one of several executives on the hotel side.
Allied Leisure, which came to the stock market in 1987, is one of the
smallest companies in its sector but is one of the more profitable. It is
third biggest in ten-pin bowling where Bass has a big presence and also owns
night clubs.
Richard Carr, the 34-year-old founder of the company, says that he hopes
Sherlock's experience will help the company add a third leg to its business.
He is selling 600,000 of his own shares to Sherlock but refuses to comment
on speculation that Sherlock may be groomed to become chairman. However,
Carr says that he intends to split his role as chairman and chief executive
before next July so that he can concentrate on being chief executive.
