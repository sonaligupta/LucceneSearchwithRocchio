FT  29 JUL 92 / Miners' bid for colliery fails


REDUNDANT miners have failed in their bid to take over Thurcroft colliery,
near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, from British Coal.
British Coal, which officially closed the loss-making pit in December,
agreed to let the miners keep it open with a view to restarting production.
But yesterday the corporation said it would seal the pit off after the
miners failed to make payments for keeping open and maintaining the pit.
