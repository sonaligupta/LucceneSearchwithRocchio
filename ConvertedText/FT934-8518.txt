FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Overnight options start in
Sydney

THE Sydney Futures Exchange is to begin trading 'overnight options' today on
SYCOM, its after-hours screen dealing system, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The product is based on the SFE's 10-year and three-year Treasury bond
futures contracts, and aims to give bondholders an additional means of
hedging overnight risk.
The overnight options will only be valid for the duration of a single SYCOM
session - from 4.40pm on one day, to 4am on the next - thus distinguishing
them from other existing option contracts.
