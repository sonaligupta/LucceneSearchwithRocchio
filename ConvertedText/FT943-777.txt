Producer prices in Sweden rose 0.8 per cent during July, contributing to a
year-on-year rise of 5.2 per cent, reported the Swedish Bureau of
Statistics. Import prices rose 0.9 per cent during the month and were up 5.4
per cent during the past 12 months. The monthly increase of import prices
was bolstered by higher coffee prices, which contributed 0.2 points to the
total rise, and higher prices on paper pulp, said SCB. Export prices,
meanwhile, rose 0.8 per cent in the month and were up 5.0 per cent from 12
months ago. The monthly increase was attributed mainly to paper products,
refined petroleum products and chemical products.
Hungary's central budget deficit for the first eight months of 1994 amounted
to Ft195.22bn (Pounds 1.2bn), or 59.2 per cent of the year's target of
Ft329.561bn, the MTI-Econews agency reported. Consumer prices in the western
German state of Bavaria rose 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-September and
were up 2.9 per cent from a year earlier.
