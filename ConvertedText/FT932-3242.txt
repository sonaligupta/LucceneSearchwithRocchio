FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drummond Pounds 3.4m in the red


OPERATIONAL difficulties arising from the integration of acquisitions and
the introduction of new equipment, as well as the effects of recession, were
behind a fall into losses at Drummond Group.
The company, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing
industry, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.38m after net
reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.6m in the year to end-March.
The outcome compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.14m last time and was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 45.6m.
Profits at the operating level were Pounds 116,000 (Pounds 2.03m). However,
this comprised profits of Pounds 658,000 (Pounds 814,000) from discontinued
operations. Continuing operations incurred losses of Pounds 542,000 against
profits of Pounds 1.21m.
Losses per share were 22.63p (4.59p earnings). There is no dividend; in
1991-92 a total of 1.5p was paid.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said the integration of Crowthers and
Courtauld Woollens, and Armatex, the group's man-made fibres division, had
taken longer to achieve than expected, while the re-equipping of the worsted
operation with modern plant had yet to show results.
The sale of Stroud Riley, the South African subsidiary, to Chargeurs
Textiles has now been completed and gross proceeds of Pounds 3.7m have been
received.
Gearing after the disposal is 66 per cent. In conjunction with the sale,
Drummond has secured overdraft facilities untill April 30 1994 on terms
which the board considers satisfactory.
