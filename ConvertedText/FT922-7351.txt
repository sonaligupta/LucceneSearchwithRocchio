FT  19 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent welcomes German pay
settlement


   By Our Markets Staff


THE PAY settlement between metalworkers and employers in Germany put most of
Europe in a good mood yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT had one of its remorselessly logical days, lifting bunds and
equities on news of the settlement, carmakers and engineers on the absence
of potentially crippling strike prospects, and most retailers on the extra
spending money that will result.
A rise of 7.96, or just over 1 per cent to 708.13 for the FAZ index at
midsession improved to 34.36, or 2 per cent at 1,758.43 for the DAX at the
close.
Turnover climbed from DM5.3bn to DM8.2bn. Traders and analysts welcomed the
settlement, indicating a 5.8 per cent pay rise for this year and one of 3.4
per cent, plus a working week cut equivalent to another 1.4 per cent for
1993.
Some dealers noted that much of yesterday's buying reflected
position-squaring following short sales last Friday. But Mr James Cornish,
County NatWest's strategist, felt there was more to go for.
Mr Cornish, who visited the Bundesbank at the end of last week, says that
another high M3 growth figure is imminent, but that the Bundesbank is not
likely not raise the Lombard rate in consequence, feeling that the figures
are being inflated by inputs which do not necessarily reflect inflation in
the German economy. So yesterday's drop in the Bundesbank's average bond
yield from 8.30 to 8.25 per cent looks soundly based.
Carmakers responded yesterday with gains of around 3 per cent, Daimler-Benz
rising DM21.30 to DM786.80, BMW up DM18 to DM579 and Volkswagen DM14.50
better at DM396; among engineers, MAN was outstanding with a rise of DM14.70
to DM383.50.
PARIS closed just off the day's highs, boosted by a firm bond market and
relief over the German situation. The CAC-40 index ended up 27.69 or 1.4 per
cent at 2,051.64 in moderate turnover of FFr2.7bn.
News late on Friday that the government planned to cut its stake in Total
from 34 per cent to 15 per cent and allow shareholders to swap their
certificates for voting shares at a parity of 4 certificates for 3 shares
prompted heavy arbitrage, which accounted for just under 10 per cent of the
day's volume. The shares dropped FFr11.80 or 4.5 per cent to FFr248.20 while
the certificates added FFr15.50 or 9.2 per cent to FFr184.40.
LVMH jumped FFr101 to FFr4,200 in 31,420 shares on good buying interest from
the UK. Eurotunnel added FFr1.15 or 3.1 per cent to FFr38.25 following
Friday's news that the government would allow it to carry heavy goods
vehicles in semi-open shuttle wagons as initially proposed. A re-design
would have cost Pounds 100m.
MILAN was boosted at the start of the new account by Fiat's 1991 results
which were announced after the close on Friday. However, optimism about
Fiat's turnround prospects was tempered by persistent political uncertainty
as the search for a president continued. The Comit index added 1.93 to
474.65 in turnover estimated at L90bn-L100bn after L117.8bn.
Fiat closed L125 higher at L4,935, catching up the gains made on London's
Seaq on Friday, but slipped L5 on the kerb. Ras, the insurer controlled by
Allianz of Germany, added L325 to L17,875 amid reports that it would use the
cash raised through its recent rights issue to buy into Banco Ambroveneto.
ZURICH saw limited domestic interest in equities, with the all-share SPI
index just 6.9 higher at 1,202.0, but foreign investors were inspired by the
German labour settlement and the Swiss government's nod toward European
Community membership. The SMI index closed 18.0 higher at 1,939.1.
Nestle bearers put on SFr140 to SFr10,100. Brokers put the gain down to
foreign buying, and a technical correction after Friday's losses.
AMSTERDAM closed higher, boosted by short-covering after Friday's expiry of
options and by demand for cyclical stocks. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.3
to 129.4.
Fokker rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 36.20 on reports that Aerospatiale, Germany's
Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia wanted to take control of the Dutch airline
manufacturer. Unilever remained under pressure after disappointing first
quarter earnings, losing 50 cents to Fl 186.80.
STOCKHOLM recovered from Friday's setback on expectations of encouraging
first quarter reports from Astra, Asea and Volvo, all due today. The
Affarsvarlden general index added 13.1 to 998.6 in turnover of SKr419m after
SKr393m. Volvo B rose SKr6 to SKr435, Asea B by SKr6 to SKr373 and Astra B
by SKr13 to SKr534.
MADRID eased in a technical correction, the general index losing 0.76 to
260.62 in an active Pta15.04bn.
Telefonica rose Pta10 to Pta1,105 on a 20 per cent gain in first quarter
profits. The power company, Endesa, expected to announce a new collaboration
pact in Europe, rose Pta40 to Pta3,650; but Viscofan, the food packaging
company which announced a 45 per cent drop in first quarter profits, fell
Pta210 or 8.5 per cent to Pta2,270.
