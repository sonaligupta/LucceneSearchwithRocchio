FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Apple boosted by notebook PC
sales


   By LOUISE KEHOE


APPLE Computer's first quarter earnings were boosted by strong sales of its
latest notebook-size portable personal computers introduced in October. The
US personal computer maker reported earnings well above Wall Street
expectations.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 166m, or Dollars 1.36 ashare,
up from Dollars 150.5m, or Dollars 1.28 in the same period a year ago.
Analysts had been forecasting earnings of about Dollars 1.05 a share.
Net revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn from the Dollars 1.68bn
reported in the first quarter of the last fiscal year.
Apple shipped well over 100,000 of its PowerBook notebook computers in the
first fiscal quarter, said Mr John Sculley, chairman and chief executive.
'We saw immediate acceptance of our PowerBooks in the notebook market where
we had not participated before.'
Apple's gross profit margins declined sharply from the same period last
year, reflecting significant price cuts; operating expenses were also
reduced, however, more than offsetting the drop in profit margins.
'During a time of difficult economic and industry challenges, we have
sustained momentum for our products, while changing our infrastructure to
remain competitive,' said Mr Sculley.
In the first quarter of fiscal 1992 international sales were 45 per cent of
net sales, unchanged from a year ago.
'We will continue to closely manage our current business, while putting in
place plans for future growth opportunities,' Mr Sculley said.
Apple recently announced plans to enter the consumer electronics market.
