FT  09 JAN 92 / Observer: Eight days a week


One of the troubles with a small place like Wales is the shortage of
politically-correct movers and shakers. When the rulers in London want to
fill a slot with a Welsh figure, the same old names pop up.
Take the case of Gwyn Jones, a 43-year-old entrepreneur who sold his
software company in 1987. One of former Welsh secretary Peter Walker's
blue-eyed boys, Jones was made part-time chairman of the Welsh Development
Agency in 1988 and after his recent reappointment his WDA workload was
increased to four days a week.
However, he has now added the Welsh BBC governorship to his portfolio, which
carries with it the chairmanship of the Broadcasting Council for Wales and
membership of the Welsh Channel 4 network. Add all the tasks together and
even Jones the computer is not capable of working eight days a week.
Jones is now going to shed some of his international workload at the WDA to
take on his new responsibilities at the Beeb. Even so his appointment does
nothing to reduce the concern within the principality at the concentration
of top jobs in such a small number of hands.
Come the election it could all be different. Different faces that is. . .
