FT  05 MAR 94 / Research spending increases by 4%


Spending on research and development rose by 4 per cent from Pounds 12.2bn
in 1991 to Pounds 12.6bn in 1992, the Central Statistical Office said
yesterday. In real terms, spending was unchanged in 1992 and represented
2.12 per cent of gross domestic product.
R&D spending for civil purposes was Pounds 10.4bn, 5 per cent higher than in
1991. Spending for defence purposes was Pounds 2.3bn, down 1 per cent.
The government funded just over a third of all R&D in 1992, nearly 30 per
cent of the civil R&D and just under two-thirds of the defence R&D.
