FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter: The legacy of Third World debt will not easily go
away


   From Mr ED MAYO


Sir, The end of the Third World debt crisis is more tricky to predict than
the beginning of the UK economic recovery. Bank of England governor, Mr
Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said in 1982 he thought the international debt crisis
'is over' ('Debt crisis at end, says new Bank head', December 31, 1982) and
every year since has seen similar claims.
I will not join you ('Latin American debt crisis', July 30) in proclaiming
its end on the tenth anniversary of its start, not least because of its
concentration on just a few countries and the fragility of financial flows
back into Latin America. The region is still deeply in debt and the legacy
of coping with it in terms of poverty and a degraded natural resource base
will not easily go away.
