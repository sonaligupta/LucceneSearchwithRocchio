FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chiltern Radio in red to tune of Pounds
179,000


Chiltern Radio yesterday reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 179,000,
bearing out its warning that it would be unable to break even in its
seasonally difficult first half.
The deficit in the comparable period was Pounds 234,000, but for the whole
of 1990-91 the result was a profit of Pounds 114,000.
Sales in the first half to March 31 rose to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 1.73m), but
the comparable figure included only three months contribution from
newly-acquired stations Galaxy Radio and Severn Sound. Losses per share
declined to 1.9p (2.5p).
The company has focused its efforts on attracting advertising from smaller
companies and has seen evidence of an improvement in sales. It will also
continue its efforts to gain another licence.
The directors have decided that it would not be prudent to pay an interim
dividend.
