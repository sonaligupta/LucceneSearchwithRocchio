FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US farmers criticised


   By LISA BRANSTEN


   WASHINGTON


ENVIRONMENTAL groups have criticised growing US reliance on chemical
fertilizers and pesticides and called on the government to show 'bold
leadership' in pushing farmers to cut the use of agrichemicals, writes Lisa
Bransten in Washington.
Programmes approved by Congress in 1990 to develop alternative ways to
protect crops remain underfunded, say the environmentalists.
A study by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy reported that the volume
of pesticides used on US crops rose 125 per cent between 1966 and 1991,
despite a slight fall after 1988. A parallel study by the World Wildlife
Federation reported that Sweden and Denmark cut pesticide use 25-50 per cent
in the late 1980s due to government-sponsored reduction programs.
