FT  20 APR 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit head recovers previous cut -
Executive Pay


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive of Kwik-Fit, the tyre, exhaust
and brake fitter, received a 49.6 per cent pay increase last year, reversing
the cut he took in the previous period, writes Paul Taylor.
The annual report shows he received pay and benefits totalling Pounds
350,000 in the 12 months to February 28, up from Pounds 234,000 the previous
year when his pay was cut from Pounds 342,000 as profits slumped. Profits,
down from Pounds 32m to Pounds 17.1m in 1992-93, rebounded by 49 per cent to
Pounds 25.4m last time.
Mr Farmer's total remuneration package, including pension contributions of
Pounds 262,000 (Pounds 267,000), increased to Pounds 612,000 last year, up
from Pounds 501,000.
