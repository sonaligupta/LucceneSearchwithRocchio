FT  16 JAN 92 / Russia backs Germany's N-arms plan

RUSSIA threw its weight yesterday behind a German plan for an international
convention to prevent the export of nuclear weapons technology to third
countries, backed by sanctions against any would-be future nuclear power.
Mr Alexander Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, gave the plan his
enthusiastic support after talks with Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, his German
opposite number.
He also issued a plea for an international programme to support continuing
nuclear research in the former Soviet Union in order to dissuade the
country's scientists from selling their potentially lethal know-how to the
highest bidder.
The plan was spelt out by Mr Genscher as a two-part convention to complement
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The first would commit existing
nuclear states to prevent the export of nuclear know-how; the second would
provide for sanctions against any country attempting to acquire nuclear
weapons technology, or produce nuclear weapons material.
He said the convention should be promoted by the existing nuclear powers,
including the US, Britain and France, as well as non-nuclear powers like
Germany worried about the consequences of Soviet weapons technology
spreading across the globe.
Mr Kozyrev said Russia would continue scientific research 'as far as it is
affordable,' underlining the shortage of funds. An international programme,
he said, could support peaceful nuclear research.
