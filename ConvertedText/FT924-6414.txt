FT  21 NOV 92 / Contracting-out attack rejected


FOR the second time in two days, the government yesterday denied that its
Pounds 1.5bn programme of contracting out government services was in
disarray over new EC regulations protecting pay and conditions of workers
when they transfer to the private sector.
A document sent to government departments by Mr Don Brereton, head of the
cabinet office efficiency unit, said it was 'nonsense to suggest that the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office or any other department has had to suspend
its programme of contracting out'.
SLATER MARTIN, an accountancy firm based in Northampton, has been fined
Pounds 250 by the disciplinary committee of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales for handling investment business client's
money when not authorised to do so.
