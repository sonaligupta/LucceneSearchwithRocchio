FT  25 AUG 92 / Letter: Marketing strategy before standard


   From Mr SAM MCCALLUM


Sir, You revealed ('Small businesses criticise quality scheme', August 21)
that the latest NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small Businesses discovered that
many small businesses are, to say the least, disillusioned by the BS5750
quality scheme. Is this surprising when owner-managers of small businesses
are encouraged to believe that BS5750 certification is the Holy Grail that
solves all marketing problems?
BS5750 needs to be put into perspective. It is important as part of a
business's overall marketing strategy, as are product, price, place,
promotion and a number of other factors.
It is a business's market orientation which enables it to gain advantage
from opportunities identified and strategies developed.
As a business and management consultant, I would strongly advise
owner-managers to think twice about BS5750 and consider how it will fit into
their overall marketing strategy. If they have not reviewed their strategy,
they should do so before doing anything else.
Funding is available from the DTI, through its package of support, for 98
per cent of all UK businesses which come within the broad definition of
small and medium-sized enterprises (SME).
