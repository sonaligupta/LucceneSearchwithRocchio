FT  28 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Election fear prompts early pay-out


   By ANDREW BOLGER


The outcome of the election is beginning to worry corporate Britain - at
least the small part of it represented by Town Centre Securities, a
Leeds-based property group.
It is bringing forward its interim dividend of 1p per share from June to
April 3. Mr Norman Bell, company secretary, said this reflected concern over
the election and the board's wish that shareholders should receive their
money in the current tax year.
Further questions were referred to Mr Arnold Ziff, the company's chairman.
Unfortunately Mr Ziff was not available for comment, but he has been more
forthcoming in his other capacity as chairman and main shareholder of Stylo,
the Bradford-based shoe retailer.
In Stylo's annual report for 1991, Mr Ziff said 'this government is doing
more harm to British industry than any government this century'.
