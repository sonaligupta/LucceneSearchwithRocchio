FT  23 NOV 92 / Demirel to press for better hearing on EC


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

TURKISH leader Suleyman Demirel takes his campaign for Turkey's membership
of the European Community to London today amid signs that Turkey's
conservative-led coalition is increasingly out of step with public opinion
on Europe.
During talks with Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, Mr Demirel will make the case
that Turkey deserves a better hearing, and that its value to the west has
become all the more vital given the political turmoil in the region.
Mr Demirel has been quick to stress that Turkey's bolstering of ties with
Black Sea and Central Asian states is no alternative to EC membership.
In turning down Turkey's application for membership in 1989, the Commission
emphasised deficiencies in Turkey's level of economic development, on human
rights and on lack of progress on Cyprus. As one EC ambassador pointed out,
the enhanced relationship now requires that the Turks address these issues
with even more urgency.
In his address to the Confederation of British industry today, Mr Demirel
will outline Turkey's commitment to customs union. From January 1 1993,
Turkey will simplify its tariff regime to re-establish the community's
preference, following legislation passed by Ankara in July.
Turkey's accord with the EC envisages eliminating import tariffs by 1996,
and adopting the community's external tariff. Yet many business groups voice
doubts about the benefits of the customs union, given the increased foreign
competition which would result from further reductions in import tariffs.
