FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Celltech losses trimmed to Pounds 4.28m


Losses at Celltech, the biotechnology group, were trimmed from Pounds 4.52m
to Pounds 4.28m pre-tax for the six months ended March 31. Turnover of
Pounds 5.5m compared with Pounds 5.35m.
The result reflected a 'good performance' from Celltech Biologics and
receipt of Pounds 2.05m (nil) milestone payments, a further tranche in the
Pounds 26m agreement with Bayer, the German pharmaceutical group.
These items offset a 26 per cent increase in research and development
investment to Pounds 6.91m and a decline in net interest income to Pounds
558,000 (Pounds 1.06m).
Celltech is continuing with its plans to float in the 1993-94 year.
