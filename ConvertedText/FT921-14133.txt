FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Alcatel to stop producing fax
machines


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and REUTER

ALCATEL, the leading French telecommunications equipment group, is to stop
making its own facsimile machines within the next six months and move to
selling other producers' equipment under its own label.
The move, by France's largest producer of fax machines, marks the final
abandonment of the government's hopes for nurturing a domestic fax-making
industry, embodied in an unsuccessful 1979 plan to promote a cheap machine.
It comes in response to falling prices and margins and intense Japanese
competition, said the group, which added that it would continue to be 'on
the offensive' as a distributor.
Alcatel's own machines last year accounted for 18.6 per cent of the French
market, rising to 27.8 per cent - a total of 62,000 units - counting in
machines made by Alcatel for sale under other suppliers' labels, such as
France Telecom, the telecommunications operator.
Fax machine production will be moved gradually over to other producers, led
by Hewlett-Packard, the US computer group, and Sagem, a French
telecommunications equipment producer, who will make machines to Alcatel's
specifications and under its label.
SNCF, the French state railway, expects profits in 1991 to be stable
compared with 1990 on a slightly higher turnover of about FFr53.6bn (Dollars
9.92bn), Reuter reports from Paris.
A spokesman said the profit figure had not been determined, but that it
would be between break-even and 1990's FFr17m.
