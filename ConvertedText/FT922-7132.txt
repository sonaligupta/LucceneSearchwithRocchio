FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bic to buy US stationery concern


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


   PARIS


BIC, the French company and leader in the international market for
disposable pens, razors and cigarette lighters, is expanding its stationery
interests in the US by buying Wite-Out for an undisclosed sum.
Wite-Out specialises in the production of corrective fluids for blotting out
mistakes made on typewriters. It has annual sales of Dollars 12m and a
market share of 15 per cent.
In recent years, the corrective fluids market has come under pressure
because of the development of typewriters and word processors with automatic
correction facilities.
However, Mr Bruno Bich, chairman of Bic's US subsidiary, said the
acquisition of Wite-Out was an 'excellent extension' of the group's product
portfolio.
Bic, which is best known for its ball-point pens and disposable razors, also
owns a number of prominent stationery brands, including Conte, one of
France's most exclusive lines of pencils and papers.
The Bic group has been expanding its US interests in recent years under Mr
Bich, who was recently named the successor to his father, Baron Marcel Bich,
as chairman of the Bic holding company when the latter retires.
