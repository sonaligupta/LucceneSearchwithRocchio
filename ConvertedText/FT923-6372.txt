FT  25 AUG 92 / Observer: Overcharged


Is the 'Dianatape' for real? The tabloid newspapers enjoyed themselves
yesterday with clues to identifying the mystery couple in the eavesdropped

would doubtless dismiss disdainfully one scurrilous suggestion that it could
be genuine, because only someone in receipt of the civil list could afford
to spend so much time chatting over a mobile phone.
