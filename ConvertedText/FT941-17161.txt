FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Pounds 150m Brazil deal for Westland


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


Westland, the UK helicopter manufacturer, has clinched a Pounds 150m order
from the Brazilian navy after protracted contract discussions and strong
French and US competition.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said the contract for nine Super
Lynx helicopters was the result of more than four years of effort.
The deal includes refurbishment and updating of the Brazilian navy's five
existing Lynx helicopters. Other contenders for the contract were the
Franco-German Eurocopter joint venture and Kaman of the US.
Together with a recent contract with Norway to supply two Sea King
search-and-rescue helicopters, the order helps to compensate Westland for
the loss of Pounds 400m worth of work on naval helicopters for Canada. The
new Canadian government announced in November it was cancelling plans to buy
43 Anglo-Italian EH101 helicopters worth Pounds 2.4bn.
The EH101, on which Westland's future is largely pinned, is now on order
only for the UK. Italy is expected to place a production contract in the
next few months.
Westland's order book stands at about Pounds 1.55bn following the Brazilian
deal. Production of the helicopters is to start this year, helping to fill
spare capacity before EH101 production work builds up in 1996.
The twin-engine Lynx, developed more than 20 years ago under an Anglo-French
collaborative programme, remains a strong export prospect for the UK
company.
Brazil is the third customer for the upgraded Super Lynx version, already in
service in South Korea and Portugal. Mr Jones said further Lynx sales were
under discussion in the Far East and the Middle East.
Helicopter sales are among prospective deals which Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK
defence secretary, is due to discuss during a tour of the Gulf region this
week. Mr Rifkind will visit Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
