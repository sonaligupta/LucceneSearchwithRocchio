FT  15 JUN 93 / BIS Annual Report: UK loses most jobs in financial services
sector  - A look at the annual report of the Bank for International
Settlements


   By PETER MARSH


THE shake-out in employment in financial services in the UK has been much
greater than in any other comparable country, underlining how the recession
has hit what was once regarded as a high-growth industry.
The BIS report says employment in financial services in the UK dropped by
10.7 per cent between 1989 and last year. Employment in this field in the US
fell over the same period by 0.4 per cent, while in France it grew 0.6 per
cent.
The study says the falls in numbers working in this area of industry 'can be
attributed to automation and excess capacity' in the financial sector.
Another aspect was the high growth in employment in this field in many
countries, including Britain, during the economic upswing in the 1980s.
In 1990 the financial services industry in Britain employed 2.8m people, or
roughly one-eighth of the total workforce and nearly double the comparable
number in 1979. During the 1980s, employment in this field grew particularly
fast in insurance, property-related services and banking.
The reduction in numbers employed in this sector in Britain since 1989
compares with the 3.9 per cent gain in employment in the Japanese financial
services industry over the same period. In Italy the increase in employment
between 1989 and 1992 was 4.8 per cent, while Spain, Australia, Canada and
Switzerland saw comparable increases of 12 per cent, 2 per cent, 0.7 per
cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Of the other nations studied in the
report, Sweden and Norway saw falls in employment in this area of 2.3 per
cent and 0.7 per cent. The analysis fails to give comparable figures for
Germany, where the financial services industry in recent years has seen
modest growth as part of general increases in employment in
non-manufacturing areas.
