FT  20 MAY 92 / Judge orders arrest of Imelda Marcos


   By JOSE GALANG


   MANILA


THE ARREST of Mrs Imelda Marcos, the once-powerful widow of deposed
Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, was ordered yesterday by a Manila
judge.
Judge Teresita Flores issued the order after Mrs Marcos failed to appear at
an arraignment in connection with charges of failing to report foreign
exchange deposits abroad.
Mrs Marcos had been accused by the government of having conspired with her
late husband in looting the economy while they were in power.
She had declared she would defy the courts in protest against what she
described as 'systematic cheating' in the May 11 election where she ran as
one of seven presidential candidates.
She ranked fifth in the vote-counting yesterday. Analysts never gave her any
chance of winning despite her claim of residual support in the rural areas.
Last Monday, she also snubbed a hearing in another court. The judge in that
court gave Mrs Marcos until June 1 to explain why she was unable to appear
at the hearing.
