FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Barcom back in the black


Barcom, formerly Venture Plant Group, returned to the black over the six
months to March 31 in spite of 'generally weak trading conditions'.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 45,000 compared with losses of Pounds 1.77m last
time. Turnover amounted to Pounds 1.44m against Pounds 3.38m. Earnings per
share emerged at 0.2p (losses of 5.6p).
The figures covered the period before the effective rescue of the ailing
company via the purchase of the materials handling division of National
Plant and Transport, funded by a placing and rights issue which raised
Pounds 15.5m. The company's name was subsequently changed and it was
admitted to the main market.
