Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) plans to cut its workforce
by a quarter, or about 5,000 employees, to prepare for competition from the
private sector, press reports said, Reuter reports from Taipei.
CPC, which will lose its monopoly on oil imports and processing in the
mid-1990s, is quoted as saying it hopes to avoid forced lay-offs.
