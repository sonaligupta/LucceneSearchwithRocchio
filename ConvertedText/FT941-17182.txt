FT  06 JAN 94 / US warns Croats on Bosnian role

   BELGRADE, LONDON


The US ambassador to the United Nations, Mrs Madeleine Albright, warned
Croatia yesterday that it could face international economic sanctions unless
it stayed out of the Bosnian war.
The warning, issued during a news conference in Zagreb, the Croat capital,
came as Moslem and Croatian negotiators in Vienna promised to make 'firm
efforts' to stop the war in central Bosnia at a top-level meeting in Bonn on
Saturday.
Mrs Albright said the US was 'very concerned' by the reported activities of
the Croatian military in support of Bosnian Croat forces. 'We have in a
number of ways warned the Croatian government and military specifically on
the subject,' she said.
Her words came hard on the heels of statements by President Franjo Tudjman
and his senior officials that Zagreb might intervene directly to support
Bosnian Croat forces encircled by Moslem-led Bosnian troops in the central
Lasva valley.
In spite of government denials, UN officers and Lord Owen, the European
Union's mediator on Yugoslavia, have claimed that Croatia has already given
military help against both Moslems and Serbs.
It was announced yesterday that Lieutenant-General Sir Michael Rose of
Britain would become the new commander of UN forces in Bosnia. General Rose,
currently commander of UK Land Forces, succeeds Belgium's Lt-Gen Francis
Briquemont, who has asked to be relieved at the end of this month.
