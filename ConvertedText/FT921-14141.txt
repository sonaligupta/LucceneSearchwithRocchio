FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sale by Polly Peck offshoot raises Dollars
24m


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


IN A further rationalisation of Polly Peck International's Turkish
businesses, Vestel, its consumer electronics subsidiary, has raised Dollars
24m (Pounds 13m) to fund working capital needs with the sale of its new
Istanbul headquarters.
Mr Tahsin Karan, Vestel chairman, confirmed yesterday that Garanti Bank, a
privately owned Turkish bank, had bought the company's Maslak building.
Vestel paid Dollars 20m for the property in 1990 as the headquarters for all
Polly Peck companies in Turkey.
The sale follows a shake-up of the board in November, and moves to sell a
minority stake in the company by the administrators of Polly Peck. Vestel
sold 18 per cent of its equity on the Istanbul stock exchange in 1990.
The company last year secured short-term finance from a group of banks and a
Dollars 10m suppliers credit from Goldstar of South Korea.
The company is heavily dependent on imported components and has been badly
hit by the collapse of Polly Peck, which in the past provided much of
Vestel's short-term finance, through letter of credit.
Mr Karan said yesterday the proceeds would not be transferred to the
administrators but used for working capital and to reduce gearing.
He added that the administrators were still looking for a strategic minority
partner for Vestel, Turkey's largest exporter of televisions and the third
largest domestic white and brown goods producer. However, he ruled out any
early sale, particularly given the company's depressed price on the Istanbul
stock exchange.
