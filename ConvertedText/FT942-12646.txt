FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica issue to reduce
state holding


   By ANDREW HILL


   MILAN


Finmeccanica, the Italian state-controlled engineering and defence group, is
planning to raise about L1,700bn (Dollars 1bn) with a rights issue, which
should reduce the state's shareholding to 58 per cent from 85 per cent.
The company described the capital increase, announced yesterday, as a means
of privatising a large part of the group, which is the main industrial and
high-technology arm of IRI, the state holding company.
IRI will subscribe L493bn for new shares in Finmeccanica, and a further
L1,000bn will be provided by a consortium of Italian and international banks
and financial institutions. The balance will be raised directly from the
market.
Finmeccanica intends to issue 852m ordinary shares, at L2,100 each, on a
one-for-one basis for each ordinary or savings share already held.
Finmeccanica's shares closed before yesterday's announcement at L2,462 in
Milan.
Finmeccanica also announced a group net profit of L33.3bn for 1993, in spite
of a first half loss of L159.9bn. This compares with a L186bn net profit in
1992. Turnover was slightly down at L10,971bn against L11,126bn.
The rights issue is the latest step in a restructuring and privatisation of
Italy's state-owned industry. In March, the outgoing government gave the
go-ahead to reorganisation of the state-controlled defence industry with a
L4,068bn increase in capital for seven companies.
The formula allowed the companies, including helicopter manufacturer Agusta,
to pass from Efim, the state holding company now in liquidation, to
Finmeccanica without burdening the new owner with an estimated L7,000bn in
debts. Finmeccanica already controls the Alenia aerospace group.
Finmeccanica said yesterday that the capital increase would be used for the
acquisition of Agusta and its sister companies, and for the reduction of its
own debts, which stood at L5,097bn at the end of 1993, against L5,310bn in
1992.
During 1993, Finmeccanica sold minority stakes in Union Switch & Signal and
Elsag Bailey Process Automation on the US stock market, and floated a 19 per
cent stake in its quoted Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary.
