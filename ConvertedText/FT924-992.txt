FT  21 DEC 92 / Belgian troops seize southern Somali port


A Belgian paratrooper talks to representatives of the warlord Col Omar Jess
in Kismayu after US and Belgian troops seized the southern Somali port
yesterday, prising control from the gunmen who have pillaged food relief for
the starving. Meanwhile a UN official said 30 trucks laden with food north
of Mogadishu were lost in an apparent case of looting. The vehicles were
believed to have been loaded with rice donated by French schoolchildren.
