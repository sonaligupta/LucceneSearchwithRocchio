FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US chip makers warn Japanese


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   WASHINGTON


THE US semiconductor industry will seek trade sanctions against Japan unless
evidence emerges of Japan opening its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) chip
market to foreign suppliers, writes Louise Kehoe in Washington.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said it wanted compliance with the
US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed last year.
The foreign share of the Japanese market has been virtually stagnant, at
about 14 per cent, for the past 21 months.
Concern is also growing in the US industry group about the potential for
Japanese 'dumping' of memory chips in the US and third-country markets.
Under the 1991 trade pact, the Japanese agreed to increase their
semiconductor imports towards a 20 per cent foreign-market share target by
the end of this year and act to prevent dumping.
