FT  28 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Advertising proposals resisted


   From Mr LIONEL STANBROOK


Sir, Your report 'Cash with order adverts reprieved' (January 22) correctly
draws attention to the compromise text on distance selling proposed by the
Greek presidency of the Council of Ministers. However, the UK's marketing
industries should not assume that the reprieve is permanent. The
Commission's contentious revised draft remains on the table - with its
restrictive provisions on cash with order, telephone selling, credit cards,
information requirements and its inclusion of the financial services and
tourism sectors.
While the Greek text does reflect some of the discussions between
governments, the Commission's text in the main may still be approved by the
European parliament, and still represents a position generally supported by
many of the EU member states. Thankfully, the UK is not one of these. The UK
Advertising Association and its members will continue to defend the UK's
effective consumer guarantees in the face of inappropriate and unwieldy EC
legislative proposals.
