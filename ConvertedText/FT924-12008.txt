FT  22 OCT 92 / Jaguar to invest Pounds 7m in car plant


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


JAGUAR, the UK luxury car maker bought by Ford in 1989, is to invest about
Pounds 7m at its assembly plant in Browns Lane, Coventry, to modernise the
final assembly track.
The investment, the first significant expenditure at the plant for more than
20 years, will allow Jaguar to introduce more modern assembly methods,
including so-called 'doors-off' assembly.
This technique has become commonplace in modern car plants. It allows the
doors to be built as sub-assemblies away from the main assembly track,
enabling easier vehicle access for other assembly operations.
The doors are fitted later in the assembly process, which helps to improve
quality and working conditions for line workers.
The outdated Browns Lane assembly facility was neglected during earlier
heavy investment by Jaguar in its engineering operations and in its body
welding plant. The assembly track will be modernised next summer during the
plant shutdown, which will be extended to three weeks.
