FT  29 JUL 92 / Management: Cool it and save your skin - Dr Michael McGannon
warns holidaymakers about seeking a place in the sun - Health Check


   By DR MICHAEL MCGANNON


If your definition of a proper holiday includes sunburn, complete with sandy
sheets and blisters, you should think again to save your skin.
Without an intact healthy epidermis your hours would be numbered. Whether in
the Mediterranean or in the back garden in Wimbledon, you should confine the
roasted meat to the barbecue.
Your skin comprises three layers: the epidermis (the outermost waterproofing
which prevents fluid loss and toxin entry), the dermis (a mixture of nerve
cells, tissue, glands and blood and lymph channels), and the subcutaneous
tissue (which cushions the outer layers from the underlying bone and
muscle).
It is the body's largest organ, and is a breathing first-line defence
against infection. Any rupture attracts a ferocious immunologic response. If
the invader penetrates beyond the skin, the battle is half over. It also
helps cool the body by dilating the vessels to cool the surface blood and by
excreting sweat. When exposed to mild radiation, it can produce the
precursor to Vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium.
There are two types of ultraviolet (UV) rays; the first, UV-A, the alleged
'safe' UV, can pass through eyelids, and penetrates into the dermal layer,
hair follicles and underlying subcutaneous tissue, causing ageing of these
tissues (wrinkles, freckles, ageing spots). The tan obtained this way will
not protect you from the burning effects of the sun.
The other ultraviolet rays, UV-B, penetrate the layers of the epidermis and
upper dermis, stimulating the production of a hard protective substance,
keratin, which thickens the skin. These are the rays believed to cause
cancer and burning.
You can take advantage of the sun this summer by knowing when the sun's UV
rays will be most intense and protecting yourself and your children
accordingly.
Because UV rays are filtered by the atmosphere, their strength depends on
the location and the time of day. Your skin will absorb less intense UV rays
in the morning and in the evening (more atmospheric gases to pass through),
and in the winter. According to Dr John Reeves, professor of dermatology at
San Francisco School of Medicine, about 65 per cent of burning rays strike
the ground during the four hours around noon.
The rays also intensify with altitude: for every 330 metres, there is a 5
per cent increase, and snow can reflect up to 100 per cent more (sand and
water reflect up to 20 per cent more UV).
As for your children, watch them carefully. Dr Reeves believes 75 per cent
of lifetime sun exposure occurs before the age of 22.
Sunscreens are de rigueur on beaches and boats this summer, as are hats, UV
protective eyeglasses, and clothing. But which Sun Protective Factor (SPF)?
SPF2 will protect against about 50 per cent UV-B, SPF4 against 75 per cent
and SPF15 against 94 per cent. All sunscreens protect primarily against
UV-B, so that the rays causing premature ageing, UV-A, are unimpeded.
The sunscreen manufacturers are researching some effective UV-A blockers.
The UV Warning Badge - one of the most promising recent innovations - is
applied to the skin and changes colour to warn that it is time to cover up.
Once the the skin is red and painful it comes down to damage control. Cool
compresses and aspirin might help a little; better still, learn to enjoy the
sun without getting cooked.
