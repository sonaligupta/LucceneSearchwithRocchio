FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Goodman unit to sell retail
activities

GOODMAN Fielder Wattie, the Australian foods group, said Cold Storage
Holdings (CSH), its quoted Singapore subsidiary, had agreed to sell its
retail businesses to Dairy Farm International for ADollars 113m (USDollars
81m).
The sale is significant because it marks Goodman's exit from retail
activities as part of its strategy of concentrating on developing core
manufacturing businesses in Australia, Asia and Europe.
The deal, which includes 10 supermarkets, 48 pharmacies and 67 convenience
stores, will realise an extraordinary gain of ADollars 49m for CSH, which is
64 per cent owned by Goodman.
Goodman said the proceeds of the sale would be used to help finance
investment of about ADollars 200m over the next three years to expand the
group's manufacturing capacity in Singapore, Indon-esia, the Philippines and
Malaysia.
Mr Michael Nugent, Goodman's chief executive, said the sale price
represented 'a significant premium' for the retail operations.
'Strategically, the sale is very significant for Goodman because it signals
our exit from non-core retail activities and allows us to pursue our
strategy in Asia,' he said.
CSH will retain its Sunshine bakery business in Singapore, as well as a
number of other food manufacturing, whole-saling and distribution
bus-inesses in Singapore and neighbouring coun-tries.
The sale is the latest element in a restructuring intended to sharpen
Goodman's manufacturing focus following a series of disappointing results.
The group recently sold its Wattie's business in New Zealand to Heinz, the
US food group, for NZDollars 566m (USDollars 314m). It has also acquired
manufacturing companies in Australia and Europe.
