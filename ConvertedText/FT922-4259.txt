FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Western Mining defers expansion

WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, yesterday
said a proposed ADollars 105m (USDollars 80.1m) expansion at its Kambalda
nickel operations would be postponed, in spite of legislation relaxing
restrictions on working hours.
The project has been abandoned or postponed several times over the last year
as WMC pursued negotiations with the miners' union to achieve a switch from
five-day to seven-day continuous mining.
The group reached agreement with the union last month after a series of
strikes and other disruptions to production. However, the agreement was
conditional on the passage of amendments to mining legislation through the
Western Australian state parliament.
The amendments were approved on Thursday, but only after the government had
added a further clause giving the state's mining minister the right to
change permissible working hours at his discretion.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the additional amendment was
'anything but acceptable'. He said it 'would seem to demonstrate that the
state government is a captive of the union movement, and prefers to remain
so, rather than create a positive investment climate'.
Mr Morgan said WMC 'cannot with confidence make further investments at
Kambalda other than that consistent with what is now contemplated as a small
operation'.
WMC's expansion plan for Kambalda would increase deep mining at several
mines in the area, where WMC produces around 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year.
The project is part of an ADollars 400m spending programme intended to
increase the group's total nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from 53,000
tonnes.
WMC shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 5.30 on the Australian Stock Exchange
after the announcement.
