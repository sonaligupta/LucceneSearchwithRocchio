FT  27 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Starting at 9.00 the BBC offers an hour and a half of modern (some would say
'alternative') comedy. The All New Alexei Sayle Show proves that, although
following in a recognisable tradition, Sayle is still his own man and may
one day be recognised as one of the most important talents of his generation
(BBC2). At 9.30 we finally see the opening episode of the second series of
Jennifer Saunders' Absolutely Fabulous with Saunders herself as the
impossible PR woman and Joanna Lumley as the gorgeous boozy Patsy. That is
followed at 10.00 by Ben Elton's comedy series The Man From Auntie.
Earlier, in First Sight, BBC2 considers white collar crime in Britain which,
we are told, 'is estimated' to cost Pounds 9bn a year (7.30). This week's
passenger in Great Railway Journeys is Natalia Makarova who travels from St
Petersburg to Tashkent (9.30 BBC2).
Channel 4 shows its second Peter Greenaway film of the week: Prospero's
Books, a modified version of The Tempest, starring John Gielgud as Prospero
(10.00).
