FT  04 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


TIN prices slumped in kerb trading on the LME, with a sharp fall in the
final minutes leaving the market testing key support, dealers said.
Three-month metal moved below Dollars 6,800 a tonne and then tumbled to
Dollars 6,750, the day's low and a Dollars 75 loss from Friday. Traders will
be looking to see if key support at Dollars 6,750 holds, but the market's
technical picture has recently turned bearish. Apart from the late sell-off,
tin was featureless throughout the session -- as were many other metals,
with physicals quiet at this time of the year, dealers said. COPPER prices
declined - news that Polish copper workers were willing to suspend their
stoppage undermined the market, which is increasingly factoring in a
settlement soon. London COCOA prices edged ahead, but with no fundamental
support. 'The market is currently in a conflict between buyers and sellers.
On one side we've got the fact the Ivorians were back in the market last
week, while on the other, there are uncertainties such as the dry weather in
west Africa,' said one dealer. Estimates of how much cocoa has been sold
from the Ivory Coast in the past week range between 10,000 and 35,000
tonnes.
