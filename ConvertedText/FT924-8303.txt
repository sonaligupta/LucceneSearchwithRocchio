FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: US retailer back into the black
with Dollars 31.6m

FEDERATED Department Stores, one of the largest US department stores group
incorporating chains such as Bloomingdale's, The Bon Marche and Jordan
Marsh, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in third-quarter results, with
a profit of Dollars 31.6m after tax.
In the same period a year earlier, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 61m.
The company, which emerged from bankruptcy in February, saw both increased
operating profits and a sharply-reduced interest charge year-on-year.
On the former score, operating income rose from Dollars 53.3m to Dollars
99.5m for the three-month period, bringing the total of the first nine
months to Dollars 207m against Dollars 103.3m last time, while sales in the
third quarter amounted to Dollars 1.79bn, up from Dollars 1.71bn.
Federated said it was particularly pleased to have 'converted stronger sales
into higher profits by reducing expenses rates and controlling markdowns'.
On the financial front, the company also benefited from much-reduced
interest charges - down from Dollars 109.6m in the third quarter of 1991, to
Dollars 43.9m this time round.
The company's shares rose Dollars  3/4 on the results but closed unchanged
at Dollars 16 7/8 .
However, Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, still sounded a note of caution ahead
of the key fourth quarter.
'For the remainder of 1992, we continue to expect modest improvement in the
business,' he said. 'We remain cautious, however, as a result of low levels
of consumer confidence and a sluggish economy that could impact sales in
this most important selling season.'
