FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher defends the union


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


MRS Margaret Thatcher ventured into the traditionally hostile territory of
Scotland yesterday and said she did not believe Scots would abandon the
union of the United Kingdom by choosing independence, James Buxton, Scottish
Correspondent, writes.
She said: 'The union has done wonderful things for us all over the
centuries. People may talk about breaking it but when it really comes to the
point they will realise that you don't jettison something that has brought
the world so much.'
Earlier, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, made an uncharacteristically
angry attack on the Scottish Nationalist party, which threatens three of the
Tories' nine Scottish seats including Mr Lang's in Galloway. He warned that
it would make Scotland 'the new Albania' of Europe, just as Albania was
abandoning socialism. He denounced the SNP as 'the most socialist party in
Europe'.
The SNP said yesterday that Scotland would lose another 100,000 jobs under
either Labour or the Tories. Mr Alex Neil, SNP vice-convener, said: 'The SNP
stands alone in offering Scots full employment.'
