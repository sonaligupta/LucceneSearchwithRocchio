FT  22 JUL 94 / DIW revises German forecast

DIW, the Berlin-based economics institute, cast aside its earlier gloomy
predictions about the German economy and forecast growth of about 2 per cent
for 1994 and 1995. In its half-yearly report the institute said the economy
would grow by 1.5 per cent in western Germany and by 8.5 per cent in the
five eastern Lander, a surprising turnaround from forecasts earlier this
year. While five of the country's independent economics institutes presented
their April reports predicting growth of 1.5 per cent for the year, the DIW
had predicted zero growth for western Germany and 0.5 per cent for the
economy as a whole. Explaining the revision of its figures, the institute
said the spring interest rate cuts came as a surprise. It still expects a
downturn, a so-called 'double-dip', later this year but this would not
affect the forecast growth.
