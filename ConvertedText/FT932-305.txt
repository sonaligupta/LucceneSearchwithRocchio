FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


AN AGGRESSIVE start to yesterday's derivatives trading died away late in the
session and by the close the September contract on the FT-SE 100 was back to
the point at which it had started - at 2,919, Christine Buckley writes.
Traders focused on Thursday's Bundesbank meeting and the possibility of
further cuts in French interest rates. Suggestions of possible French
withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate mechanism also found credence.
Stock index futures gained added impetus from strength in the long gilt
market and German government bond futures. Some heart was also taken from
the strength of sterling.
But volume in the Footsie future was thin - about half that of an average
day - with just 5,728 contracts traded. The contract traded within a narrow
range of 13 points.
One analyst saw the fading of the futures contract as a reflection of a
market which had started buoyantly as news of the Baghdad bombing was
absorbed, only to fall back as other markets opened.
The closing quotation showed a premium of about 22 points to the cash
market, with the fair value premium at an estimated 11 points.
Traded options trod a similarly modest path path with turnover of 21,964.
The top performer was Amstrad with 3,323 lots traded. Hanson took second
place with 2,328 contracts traded.
