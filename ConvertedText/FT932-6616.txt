FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Countryside cash call - Pounds 16.8m rights
to fund expansion as profits rise 28%


   By PAUL TAYLOR


COUNTRYSIDE Properties, the residential, commercial and industrial property
company based in the south east of England, is seeking to raise Pounds 16.8m
to fund an expansion of its housebuilding activities through a 3-for-11
rights issue priced at 106p.
The cash call was accompanied by a bullish assessment of the group's
housebuilding prospects from Mr Alan Cherry, chairman, and the interim
results which showed a 28 per cent increase in pre-tax profits because of
the absence of provisions.
In his letter to shareholders Mr Cherry said, 'there are signs that the
housing market has begun to recover from the recession which started towards
the end of 1988. Against this background the directors consider that it is
now appropriate to expand the group's housebuilding activities.'
Countryside plans expansion on two fronts: speculative housebuilding for
sale to owner occupiers, and housebuilding under design and build contracts
for housing associations and other social housing agencies. Eventually the
group is aiming to build 3,000 new homes a year in the south east - up from
a projected 1,250 this year.
Funds raised through the rights issue, underwritten by Smith New Court, will
be used 'to take advantage of opportunities to purchase land which is
currently under option, at what is expected to prove to be advantageous
prices.'
Looking ahead, Mr Cherry described the group's forward sales position of in
excess of Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 55m this time last year as 'most
encouraging.' He said both inquiries and sales reservations had 'greatly
improved' and that new house prices had generally stabilised with modest
increases being obtained on some developments.
In the six months to March 31 the group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.6m compared with Pounds 2.04m. Last time profits were reduced by a Pounds
1.02m provision relating to residential development sites. Turnover slipped
to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 42.2m).
Sales by the residential division increased to Pounds 36.7m (Pounds 36m) and
profits grew to Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 2.9m). The commercial division made a
profit of Pounds 100,000 compared with a loss of Pounds 300,000 on turnover
which fell from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 2.3m, while property investment income
was static at Pounds 2.9m and produced an unchanged loss of Pounds 600,000.
Earnings per share increased to 4.3p (3.2p) and the interim dividend is
being maintained at 1.41p.
The group's shares closed unchanged at 130p.
