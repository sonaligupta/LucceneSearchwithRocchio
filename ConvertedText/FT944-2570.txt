FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New look at brain abnormalities


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has developed an imaging
technique which could make it easier for doctors to examine brain function
abnormalities, such as epilepsy.
The technique is a form of magnetic resonance imaging, which monitors the
electromagnetic radiation given off by excited nuclei in a magnetic field.
The 'double echo' MRI method produces separate images of the neurons and
adjacent blood flows by relying on differences in the fall-off
characteristics of their wave signals. Toshiba believes the accuracy and
speed of the technique will assist doctors with diagnosis, presurgical
mapping and the exploration of complex brain functions.
