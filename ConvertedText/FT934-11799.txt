FT  29 OCT 93 / Observer: Cause celebre


It starts heartwarmingly enough. In May, Bianca Jagger, representing the
Albert Schweitzer Foundation, takes out of Tuzla, Bosnia, two severely-ill
children. One dies, but the other, Mohamed Ribic, aged 8, undergoes
successful heart surgery and is installed in Bianca's Manhattan apartment,
where she proclaims her undying love for him.
Now Bianca says Mohamed is homesick and wants to go back to Tuzla. She and
her partner Robert Torricelli, a prominent New Jersey congressman, bombard
the UN High Commission for Refugees and the US embassy in Zagreb with
demands that transport be arranged immediately. UNHCR, Torricelli has
declared, 'did nothing to save Mohamed's life and now they're doing nothing
to help return him to his family'. He is now insisting he will take the boy
back to Tuzla by land from Zagreb if UNHCR does not provide a flight.
Officials point out that Mohamed's father is disabled and half-blind, the
family squatting in an unheated ruined house. Last week a Danish truck
driver was killed on the road to Tuzla.
Bianca says, heart-rendingly, that Mohamed wants to go home and who is she
to say he can't? Would that other refugees had such powerful patrons.
