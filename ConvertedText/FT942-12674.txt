FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bett Brothers shows all-round growth


   By GRAHAM DELLER


Growth across its range of activities helped Bett Brothers record a
substantial increase in profits before tax in the six months to February 28.
On turnover ahead 39 per cent to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 9.17m) the profit line
at this Dundee-based housebuilding and property group jumped from Pounds
551,000 to Pounds 3.1m.
The housebuilding side completed 84 units, up from 66 last time.
The company expects to sell more than 200 units in the full year despite the
market remaining 'challenging'.
Commercial property development contributed Pounds 1.7m to operating profit
while Bett Inns, the hotels, public houses and catering operation, delivered
improved results 'in circumstances where the trade both nationally and
locally is down'.
Interest charges dipped to Pounds 371,000 (Pounds 406,000). Gearing at
end-February was 42 per cent, down from 52 per cent at the company's August
year-end.
Earnings per share leapt to 13.85p (3.67p). The interim dividend is raised
from 0.5p to 1.25p in anticipation of a satisfactory result for the full
year'.
