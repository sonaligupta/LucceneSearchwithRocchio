FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Corrections, new highs
in region as Nikkei adds 2.4%

Buying by arbitrageurs and foreign investors boosted share prices on the
first full-day session for the year, and the Nikkei average closed 2.4 per
cent up, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 413.74 at 17,783.48, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks rose 16.88, or 1.2 per cent, to 1,462.85. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 3.16 higher at 1,213.54.
The Nikkei opened at the day's low of 17,376.54 and advanced steadily on
arbitrage linked buying in tandem with a rise in the futures market. After a
brief lull in the afternoon, further demand from overseas investors and
investment trusts pushed the benchmark to a day's high of 17,793.18 just
before the close.
Volume amounted to 293m shares, after Tuesday's half-day session total of
118m. Rises overwhelmed declines by 818 to 181, with 112 issues unchanged.
Financial institutions were seen selling, and traders expected profit-taking
to increase as the index approaches the 18,000 level. However, strong buying
of blue chip issues by foreign investors supported prices. 'Many foreigners
think that other overseas markets are becoming too high, and are increasing
their allocation in Japanese shares,' said a Japanese trader.
Prospects of rationalisation and the lower yen continued to lift export
orientated, high-technology stocks. Fujitsu, the most active issue of the
day, climbed Y12 to Y866. Sony added Y220 at Y5,840 on foreign buying.
Automakers were also strong, with Isuzu Motors up Y26 to Y395 and Honda
Motor gaining Y60 at Y1,630.
Ajinomoto, a leading food manufacturer, moved ahead Y140 to Y1,340 on
reports of its anti-Aids vaccine development project. Other drug and
bio-technology issues were higher, with Dainippon Pharmaceutical rising Y44
to Y1,040.
Stronger gold prices pushed up Sumitomo Metal Mining by Y5 to Y924. Hanwa, a
steel trader which was sold heavily last month on speculation of financial
problems, rebounded Y72 to Y535 on short-covering.
Hopes of growing demand for car navigation systems left Pioneer Electronic
Y70 stronger at Y2,910.
The day's losers included banks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank lost Y10 to Y1,790 and
Mitsubishi Bank Y10 to Y2,620 on profit-taking. Real estate companies were
weak. Mitsubishi Estate shed Y7 to Y913.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 320.65 to 19,591.76 in volume of 19.4m
shares.
Roundup
The region mixed yet more highs in some markets with corrections in others.
TAIWAN posted one of its biggest percentage gains in years, opening 1994
with a 5.7 per cent rise to a 42-month high. The weighted index closed
346.28 ahead at 6,416.84 as turnover soared to TDollars 145bn, the heaviest
since June 1990.
Dealers and speculators celebrated the start of same-day trading, allowing
sales of stocks bought earlier in the same day, although professionals said
the move increased chances that the market would hit bouts of heavy
profit-taking.
The market ignored the Finance Ministry's proposal to reimpose a stock
capital gains tax.
SEOUL was a study in contrasts. The stock index hit a new peak, 9.63 higher
at 886.93, as foreign investors continued to support financials and shares
with low price-to-book ratios.
However, brokers said the market was due to consolidate on selling pressure
from the Korea Stock Market Stabilisation Fund, and three trusts which are
subject to pay back Won2,600bn in soft loans to the central bank by February
10.

looking for undervalued shares. The KSE index rose 20.13 to 2,274.02.

mining and gold stocks pushed the All Resources index ahead 30.9 to 1,356.6.

ADollars 5.97. Turnover was ADollars 744.91m.

provisional HKDollars 13.14bn, down from Tuesday's record HKDollars 15.1bn.
SINGAPORE called it a correction as the Straits Times Industrial index fell
39.91, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,431.99 after hitting an intraday all-time high
of 2,482.91.
BANGKOK saw record turnover of Bt40bn as investors took profits, and the SET
