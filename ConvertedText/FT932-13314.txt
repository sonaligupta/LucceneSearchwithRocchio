FT  23 APR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


COPPER'S price recovery was halted in late trading at the London Metal
Exchange yesterday when forward, producer-related, hedge selling and fresh
Chinese selling took the three months price back to Dollars 1,865 a tonne.
Final business was at Dollars 1,868 a tonne, still up Dollars 10 on the day.
Earlier Wednesday's recovery from 5 1/2 -year lows had been continued,
lifting the price to Dollars 1,920 a tonne at one stage. Traders noted that,
while the market was heavily oversold, there was strong reluctance to test
resistance at Dollars 1,930 a tonne. The ALUMINIUM market suffered a
technical breakdown around Wednesday's closing level of Dollars 1,125 a
tonne for three months metal and this was followed by option-related selling
and the triggering of stop-loss selling orders, which forced prices down to
Dollars 1,105 at one stage. The market ended at Dollars 1,110 a tonne, down
Dollars 12 from Wednesday's kerb close. COCOA futures held on to small gains
scored early in the day as the market continued to trade in a narrow range.
'What this market needs is some convincing fundamental news,' said one
trader.
