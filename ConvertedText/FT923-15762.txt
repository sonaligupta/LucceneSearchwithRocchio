FT  01 JUL 92 / Serbs put controls on wages and prices


   By LAURA SILBER

THE Serbian government yesterday announced wage and price controls, blaming
international sanctions for the deterioration of the economy.
At the same time, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported that the
Yugoslav federal government would devalue the dinar by 85 per cent from
today.
The currency has plummeted over the past year as the already weak Serbian
economy has been hit by the cost of waging war with Croatia and Bosnia and
the severance of trade ties with the former Yugoslav neighbouring republics.
Mr Radoman Bozovic, Serbia's prime minister, said the sanctions were unjust
and 'causing enormous social and material damage'. Industrial production
would drop by an extra 40 per cent in the next quarter as a direct result,
he claimed. It fell by 30 per cent in the first three months, the same
period in 1991. He added that 100,000 workers had already been sent on
compulsory vacation.
The Serbian economy was already in decline before the UN sanctions were
imposed last month, cutting off all economic ties including an oil embargo.
Monthly inflation last month hit 102.3 per cent, according to official
figures released yesterday. Mr Bozovic said wages had to be curbed and
prices strictly controlled. The prices of basic goods, including medicine,
flour and sugar, would be frozen.
