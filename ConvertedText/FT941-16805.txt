FT  07 JAN 94 / International Company News: USAir in drive to reduce
short-haul costs


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


USAir, the lossmaking carrier in which British Airways holds a minority
stake, yesterday announced the first phase of a plan to cut operating costs
in its domestic short-haul market this summer.
It is to improve productivity and make better use of its assets by heavily
reducing the amount of time its aircraft spend on the ground between
flights, initially on 18 routes between US city pairs.
Turnround times will be cut from the current average of about 45 minutes to
about 25 minutes through a number of efficiency improvements: for example,
getting cleaners on to the aircraft while passengers are still disembarking,
and tightening check-in procedures to make sure that flights leave on time.
USAir said the changes would allow it to raise the number of departures per
aircraft from 6.9 a day to 8.4 on the 18 selected routes, increasing total
daily departures from 152 to 184. The aim, it said, was to increase
passenger numbers without increasing staff or other costs. It is not
planning an accompanying cut in fares.
The airline's move comes as large US carriers face increasing competitive
pressure from small airlines which have seized market share by offering
low-cost, no-frills services on short-haul US routes.
USAir turned in net losses of Dollars 178m in last year's third quarter, the
worst result of any of the big larger US carriers, the rest of which
reported profits.
