FT  16 MAR 94 / People: NatWest's newest customer runs the bank


Even before taking up his role in the new post of finance director for
National Westminster's UK branch business, Paul Biddle has a related task to
perform: to become a NatWest customer himself.
In moving from being finance director for Digital Equipment, the computer
group, Biddle sees himself becoming a NatWest bank customer but not a
banker.
He says that he regards 'the business I'm joining as fundamentally a
retailing business - it just happens to be financial products they're
selling'.
He believes his new job - which he takes up in mid-April - will enable him
to draw on his experience in industry.
He has worked for Unilever and Rank Xerox, following his training as a
chartered accountant.
The priority he sees for the years ahead will be to find the right balance
of ways of distributing products to customers, through electronic and
telephone banking, as well as the traditional branch network.
Martin Gray, chief executive of NatWest's UK branch banking, said that
Biddle's responsibilities would include developing and setting the financial
strategy for retail banking operations; managing the budget planning; and
liaising with other parts of the group on long and short-term financial
strategies.
In creating this new role is NatWest implying it may have missed out in the
past, through not having a finance director for the UK branch business?
Biddle says only that he suspects they have not put in place the appropriate
management processes - such as planning and budgeting - which are 'almost
taken for granted in the industrial environment'.
