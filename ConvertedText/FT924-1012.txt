FT  21 DEC 92 / Opposition pledge on French central bank

FRANCE'S centre-right UDF party is to table plans early next year to grant
independence to the French central bank, the strongest indication yet of the
French opposition's commitment to the defence of the embattled franc.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, former French president and leader of the UDF,
the smaller of the two opposition parties, told Les Echos newspaper that he
had asked his party to table a proposed law in the national assembly early
in the year, to be ready for debate straight after the March parliamentary
election.
This would give the Banque de France similar status to the German
Bundesbank, a factor in the D-Mark's strength.
It could be one of the first pieces of legislation by the right-wing
alliance of the UDF and Gaullist RPR, which is expected to win the election
by a wide margin, according to opinion polls.
It would put France well in advance of the Maastricht treaty's timetable,
which - if applied - would make central banks independent some time after
January 1994 and before 1999.
Analysts welcomed the move and said it called into question the theory held
by some traders that the opposition would devalue or float the franc on
winning the election, to pave the way for a drop in interest rates to
relaunch the sluggish economy.
'The clear commitment to a strong currency and central bank independence
from a key opposition figure is extremely important,' said Paribas Capital
Markets.
