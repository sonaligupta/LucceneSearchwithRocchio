FT  01 JUL 92 / Brussels investment directive receives a cautious welcome


   By SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN


EUROPEAN banks and brokers gave a cautious welcome to the terms of the
Investment Services Directive (ISD) agreed by European Community finance
ministers on Monday.
The agreement gives investment firms a 'single passport' to deal in shares
throughout the European Community. It covers three key issues - of
transparency, concentration and freedom of access - leaving only minor
details to be resolved in the next few weeks, EC officials said.
The deal seems unlikely to pull international trading away from the City of
London, where much of the European equities business is currently conducted.
The issue of transparency - the distribution of information about prices and
volumes of securities trades - proved a stumbling block in the negotiations,
as market environments vary sharply.
The UK had wanted the directive to allow some delay before price and volume
details are released to the market, for fear that rapid disclosure would put
City marketmakers at a disadvantage, whereas some of the Mediterranean
countries wanted the information to be released more quickly. Many UK houses
are pressing for more details concerning the exclusion clauses agreed in the
directive, which would allow them to delay the reporting of large
transactions or deals in illiquid stocks.
Individual exchanges will be free to define what constitutes a large or
illiquid trade.
For French brokers, the new directive represents a less restrictive system,
since reporting requirements are already very stringent. The Bourse's
screen-based system reports price and volume information immediately.
Commerzbank, one of Germany's biggest banks, said it did not expect the new
directive to have much effect on the country's larger financial institutions
which were already represented on important EC stock exchanges.
