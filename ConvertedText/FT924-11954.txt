FT  23 OCT 92 / Billionaire PM


   By REUTER


Lebanon appointed Mr Rafik al-Hariri, 48, a billionaire entrepreneur, as its
prime minister yesterday, hoping he will use his money-making skills to stop
the economic and social rot caused by 15 years of civil war, Reuter reports.
He was named to his first job in politics after winning the backing of
Syria, Saudi Arabia and most members of parliament.
