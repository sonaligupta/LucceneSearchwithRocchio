   HONG KONG


Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong-based fashion retailer and wholesaler,
announced yesterday it is to sell its controlling stake in Innovisions to a
mainland company, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong.
Maxton International, 60 per cent owned by the subsidiary of a state-owned
enterprise, Shenzhen Building Materials Industrial Group Company, will
subsequently make a general offer for all outstanding shares in Innovisions,
an optician and optical goods retailer.
Earlier attempts to sell Innovisions had to be aborted last month after the
would-be buyer and Dickson Concepts failed to agree terms.
