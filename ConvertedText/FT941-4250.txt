FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lose ground on US
weakness


   By Our Markets Staff


Weakness in the US bond markets and, in the afternoon, in their European
counterparts left bourses mainly flat or lower after earlier gains, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT followed the pattern of the week, confident for a while but losing
all, or most of its verve by the end of the day. The Dax index rose 25.01 to
2,141.10 on the session but subsided, finally, to an Ibis-indicated
2,124.51.
Mr John Blackley of James Capel said that German investors saw better
prospects of a rate cut next week or, failing that, after the Fed's open
market committee meets in eleven days' time. Equities, he said, continued to
trail after bonds yesterday; bunds had a good rally in the morning session
but in late afternoon the June bund future was unchanged, after a rise of 60
basis points at one stage.
Turnover was level at DM9bn. Daimler, a current favourite on the switch from
BMW, ended just DM10 better at DM825 in London after an earlier gain of
DM25; Allianz, the insurer, went from DM45 up to DM6 down.
News driven stocks fared worse, Siemens closing just DM2.30 higher at
DM692.30 on the session, and dropping to DM675.50 after hours; Viag was
suspended on its DM2.3bn purchase of Bayernwerk, the electric utility, from
the Bavarian state; Mr Blackley said the price was higher than expected and
Viag could be marked lower today.
PARIS fell as the Bank of France decided not to cut its repo rates, and as
banks in the Paribas orbit seemed to get a sniff of the latter's rights
issue, announced late in the day. BNP fell FFr5.90 to FFr258.10 and Cie
Bancaire by FFr28 to FFr606 as the CAC 40 index fell 15.06 to 2,184.58.
Turnover was FFr4.2bn. Mr Michael Woodcock at Nikko Europe said that
Paribas, up FFr4 at FFr506, could move on the rights issue today.
The hotel group, Accor, was another major faller, losing FFr14 at FFr716
after the Belgian supreme court rejected its attempt to overturn an August
1992 ruling ordering it to pay more to minority shareholders of its Wagons
Lits acquisition; the estimated cost to Accor is in the region of FFr700m.
ZURICH was firmer but off its best levels after Wall Street's weaker opening
and lower US bond prices. The SMI index added 2.7 to 2,861.2 with some
support emerging from next week's expiry of index futures, with many
investors still believed to be short.
Brown Boveri rebounded after an early fall to finish SFr46 higher at
SFr1,171 on a dividend maintained in spite of high restructuring costs.
Nestle added SFr13 to SFr1,263: the company refused comment on US market
rumours that it planned to buy Gerber, the Michigan-based baby-food maker.
MILAN saw a mixed performance but the Comit index remained in positive
territory adding 0.85 to 663.74.
BCI fell L201 or 3.2 per cent to L6,107 on selling by investors allocated
shares in its privatisation. Of other recently privatised financials, IMI
fell L111 to L12,771 but Credito Italiano picked up L17 to L2,665.
Telecoms had a good day as March 19 was set for a decision on an exchange of
shares as a step towards their ultimate fusion. Stet, the state holding
company, added L93 or 2 per cent to L4,817 and Sip, its main operating
company, gained L180 or 4.3 per cent to L4,363 on reports that its licence
fee would be reduced progressively as compensation for losing its cellular
telephone monopoly.
Fiat bounced L119 higher to L4,970 as investor demand returned. Parmalat
shed L92 or 3.6 per cent to L2,448 in response to results and a bond issue
plan.
AMSTERDAM traded cautiously but found some confidence from a firm bonds
market and the AEX edged up 1.85 to 422.60.
Heineken bounced towards the end of trading and added Fl 2.20 to Fl 201.30.
According to one salesman the market had anticipated the company's good
results - released after the end of the session.
The aircraft maker, Fokker, which dipped in the previous session after its
results, lost a further Fl 2.90 to Fl 15.40. Philips was lifted US
institutional interest and improved Fl 1.40 to Fl 55.20; strong turnover was
seen in Polygram, which added Fl 1.60 to Fl 81.50 as Hoare Govett issued a
positive note on the global music business.
STOCKHOLM saw mixed corporate results, and the Affarsvarlden index fell 5.4
to 1,524.3.
Skandia, which posted record profits after the close on Wednesday, dipped
SKr10 to SKr161 on a planned SKr3bn share issue. Aga B fell SKr10 to SKr423
on results but Asea A were SKr7 higher at SKr604.
Volvo B were SKr7 lower at SKr683 in response to the company's 1993 loss,
due to write-downs of its Renault interests, and news that it may retain its
full 20 per cent shareholding in the French carmaker.
Hennes & Mauritz, the retailer, surged SKr42 or 14 per cent to SKr340 as its
full year pre-tax profits proved well above market expectations.
ISRAEL suffered further erosion of sentiment following recent arrests for
alleged share manipulation. The Mishtanim index fell 8.12 to 202.08.
Blue chips were left at their lowest for the year and of the 1,190 shares,
64 were registering sellers only.
