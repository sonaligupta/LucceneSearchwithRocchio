FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: BMW forecasts surge in Japanese sales


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


The growing popularity of imported cars in Japan will almost triple sales of
BMW cars by the year 2000, according to forecasts by the German car maker.
Mr Siegfried Richter, president of BMW Japan, said that the company expected
to boost annual sales in Japan to 80,000 units in 2000, compared with last
year. Mr Richter was encouraged in his optimistic outlook by the greater
cost-competitiveness of imported cars and a growing acceptance of
foreign-made vehicles by Japanese consumers.
The trend was likely to take the foreign share of Japan's car market to more
than 15 per cent by the turn of the decade, compared with about 6 per cent
now, he said. Efforts by foreign vehicle manufacturers to penetrate the
Japanese market are also being stepped up. BMW, for example, plans to
increase the number of dealers handling its cars to more than 200 from 153
at present. Foreign car makers have also been introducing attractive
low-interest loans.
The German car maker expects sales this year to rise 16 per cent to 30,000
units. In the period from January to August sales have risen more than 12
per cent to 18,689.
Imported cars saw a 40 per cent rise in the first six months of this year to
137,000 units, according to the Japan Automobile Importers' Association. In
August alone, imported cars surged 70 per cent, marking the 10th consecutive
monthly rise.
