FT  15 JUN 93 / Farmers intend to sue Lloyd's


   By RICHARD LAPPER


MR GORDON APSION, an Oxfordshire barrister who specialises in agricultural
issues, is heading a new legal challenge to the Lloyd's insurance market on
behalf of more than a dozen small farmers who claim they could lose their
livelihoods as a result of their losses as Names.
Like more than 2,000 other Names, they are suing their agents. But Mr Apsion
also intends to sue the council of Lloyd's, the market's governing body, and
the corporation of Lloyd's, which administers the market. He says Lloyd's
'ought to have been aware about the malpractices in the operation of the
market'.
Mr Apsion expects more farmers to join his action. An article about the
farmers' plight in Farming News, a trade publication with 90,000 readers,
'generated more reader response than any other individual story for several
years,' said Mr Richard Saunders, the news editor of Farming News.
Many of the more than 30 calls have come from farmers, who have used their
land as security for the bank guarantees presented to Lloyd's as security.
Mr Apsion has referred farmers to Hancocks, a commercial law firm.
Under the 1982 Lloyd's Act, Lloyd's is immune from paying damages from a
civil suit unless it can be shown as acting in bad faith.
