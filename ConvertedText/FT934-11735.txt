FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Elkem turnround at nine months


   By KAREN FOSSLI


ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday disclosed a nine-month
pre-tax profit of NKr64m (Dollars 9.1m), against a loss of NKr307m last
year. It was helped by cost reductions, a decline in domestic energy taxes,
favourable currency exchange rates and slightly higher sales volumes.
The company said it was holding debt restructuring negotiations which are
expected to be completed by the end of autumn.
Group net sales rose by NKr285m to NKr5.72bn as operating profit shot up to
NKr282m from NKr40m last year. Operating costs increased slightly by NKr63m
to NKr5.23bn.
Elkem reduced nine-month net financial expenses by NKr46m to NKr217m,
including a decline of NKr68m in net interest costs to NKr242m. 'The fall in
interest expenses is mainly due to a reduction in net debt,' which fell to
NKr3.4bn at end-September from NKr4.5bn at the end of 1992, Elkem said.
It said agreement in principle had been reached with its banks to
restructure the group debt which falls due at the end of this year and 1994.
The restructuring proposal calls for four syndicated credit facilities -
which mature during December 1993 to December 1994 - to be consolidated into
one facility of about Dollars 275m to be repaid during a four-year period
from 1994.
Elkem's prospects will be affected by the lack of growth in demand for
metals and alloys. 'There are no signs yet of a significant improvement in
the world economy,' it said.
While anti-dumping measures and structural changes contributed to a slight
increase in prices for ferrosilicon and ferromanganese during the second
half of this year, prices for aluminium, silicon metal and ferrochrome
declined, the company added.
