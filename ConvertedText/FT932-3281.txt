FT  15 JUN 93 / Letter: Solution to left-right dichotomy


   From Dr JAN CLIFFORD LESTER


Sir, Samuel Brittan writes ('Clan hatreds divide Left from Right', June 7)
that 'the left-right dichotomy is a hopeless method of finding one's way
around' monetary and fiscal policy. But in his Left and Right: the Bogus
Dilemma and Capitalism and the Permissive Society he more or less solves the
problem without realising it.
As he shows, there is a fairly clear tendency for the left to be for state
regulation of 'the economy' (and against state regulation of personal
liberty) while the right are more likely to be the opposite. Where the
economic aspects are currently state-ridden the right are thus consistent in
seeking at least to second guess the market.
Of course, this is not a perfect description of left-right usage, and it
does conflict with some self-descriptions. But it clarifies debate
enormously to make this fairly realistic distinction stipulative. We are
then also able to introduce a libertarian-authoritarian north-south axis.
This accommodates both Samuel Brittan (as a north-winger) and me (extreme
north-winger). I leave the reader to say which politicians are really
south-wingers.
