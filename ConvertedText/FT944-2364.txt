FT  16 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Asda


Asda's shares have outperformed the market by 34 per cent so far this year,
the best performance of any FTSE 100 stock after British Steel and GKN, and
better than all the food retailers except Morrison. Yesterday's sparkling
figures show why.
Asda is enjoying a renaissance which has brought it back from the brink.
Like-for-like sales growth rose 7.1 per cent in the first half, far better
than other superstores and a considerable achievement in a competitive
market. The performance reflects a full-scale revamp of the stores'
offering, as well as price cutting. The latter led to a 0.5 per cent fall in
gross margins, significantly worse than at competitors such as J. Sainsbury
or Tesco. However this was more than offset by a combination of greater
productivity and increased sales volumes. The result is that operating
profits at the Asda stores rose at more than twice the rate of sales growth.
The muted market reaction to yesterday's numbers reflects some disquiet
about Asda's falling depreciation charge. But the real issue is whether Asda
is becoming just another well-run food retailer, rather than a recovery
story. Its three year restructuring programme comes to an ends next summer.
Thereafter earnings growth will slow. In the meantime, investors'
preferences are likely to shift to the dull performers in the sector, for
example J. Sainsbury.
