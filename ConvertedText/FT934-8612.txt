FT  15 NOV 93 / Manufacturers 'still cutting jobs'


MANUFACTURERS are still making people redundant and fewer than one in 10
have job vacancies, in spite of industry's fragile recovery from recession,
according to a survey by the AEEU engineering and electrical union.
A poll of 350 companies covering 175,000 workers showed that one in five
shed jobs in the three months to September. Order books showed no sign of
improvement, with more than half those questioned describing the position as
'average', 15 per cent believing things were 'poor' and just one in four
saying orders were 'good'.
The survey comes ahead of unemployment figures on Thursday. Recently the
jobless total has fallen and now stands at 2.9m.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, disclosed that his union's engineering
section lost 13 per cent of its members last year.
The survey shows average pay rises in manufacturing in three months to
September were 2.47 per cent, a slight increase on the previous quarter's
2.33 per cent.
