FT  23 NOV 92 / Judges too old and 'out of touch'


   By ROBERT RICE


JUDGES ARE too old, too male and too out of touch, according to a survey of
public attitudes to the legal system published today, Robert Rice writes.
More than 65 per cent of 1,000 people in England and Wales surveyed for the
magazine Solicitors Journal agreed that 'judges are out of touch with
everyday life and everyday people'.
Almost 80 per cent said there should be more female judges. At present only
four of the 83 High Court judges are women and there is only one female
Appeal Court judge.
Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor, and Lord Taylor, the lord chief justice,
have both said that judges must be appointed on merit and the sex of the
applicant is not a consideration.
More than 85 per cent of respondents thought judges should retire earlier. A
total of 23 per cent of those surveyed said that the retirement age for
judges should be 60.
The survey shows that the public does not have strong feelings either way
about whether judges should continue to wear wigs in court. But more than
half said they were opposed to the televising of court cases, and most said
they feel that awards for libel were too high.
