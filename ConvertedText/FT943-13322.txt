FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Three speech


John Prescott refuses to turn up his toes in front of the Tony Blair
bandwagon. As voting for the leadership of the UK's Labour party formally
ended, a cheery Prescott told Observer he is armed with three speeches for
Thursday's election announcement.
One will pontificate on his election as Labour leader; another on his
achieving the deputy post. And the third? Oh, that'll cover the eventuality
he wins both.
