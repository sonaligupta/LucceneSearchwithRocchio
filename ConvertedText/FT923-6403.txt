FT  25 AUG 92 / HSE acts on finger disease: British Association for the
Advancement of Science


   By CLIVE COOKSON


TECHNIQUES to combat asbestos-related lung cancer and vibration white
finger, the most commonly reported industrial disease last year, were
announced yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
Although only 5,400 cases of vibration white finger (VWF) were reported last
year, the HSE estimates that about 20,000 British workers suffer from it
moderately or severely. VWF, which was recognised officially in 1985, is
caused by vibrating hand-tools such as grinders, pneumatic drills and
chainsaws. It leads to pain and loss of strength in the fingers.
A computerised technique for measuring vibration in the hands will identify
workers at risk in the foundry industry and in shipbuilding and repair
yards. An HSE survey showed that 130,000 people used vibrating equipment for
long enough to cause concern.
Once those at risk have been identified, either the tools will be adapted to
dampen vibration or workers will use them for shorter periods.
The HSE will also monitor the number of asbestos fibres in the air, using a
light-scattering technique which gives an instant reading. Sir John Cullen,
chairman of the Health and Safety Commission, part of the HSE, said more
than 1,000 cases a year of lung cancer were attributable to asbestos
exposure. He said the instrument, which is likely to cost up to Pounds
10,000, would help to reduce exposure 'during the huge programme of asbestos
removal now going on'.
