FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: BCE to hold 16.5% in Talisman
Energy

BCE, Canada's biggest telecom group, will have a 16.5 per cent interest in
Talisman Energy, the former BP Canada, as a result of tendering its Encor
common and convertible preferred shares to Talisman under a revised offer.
The value of this holding will be about CDollars 275m (USDollars 217m) at
present market prices.
BCE controlled Encor, the former exploration subsidiary of TransCanada
PipeLines, through its holding of Encor common and convertible preferred.
Talisman, now an independent upstream oil and gas producer, made an offer
for Encor early this year and following criticism from institutional
investors, revised it twice.
Encor shareholders late last week approved the latest offer.
BCE is expected to divert its Talisman holding later, because it has decided
to leave the energy field and concentrate on its telecom business.
