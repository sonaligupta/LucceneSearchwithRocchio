FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Finland poised to take 14.8% of
KOP


   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES


THE FINNISH government is set to take a 14.8 per cent stake in
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP), the country's leading commercial bank, after
receiving shares worth FM1bn from the bank. This is part-payment for its
purchase of a share in the business of the Savings Bank of Finland (SBF),
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
KOP plans to issue 77m new shares worth FM13 each to the government
guarantee fund, which is selling SBF to four Finnish banks.
The bank will pay a further FM400m (Dollars 69.6m) in cash to the government
for its share of SBF's assets. It is poised to take over 135 SBF branches
and FM12bn of deposits.
The issue will raise KOP's share capital from FM4.42bn to FM5.19bn. The
government has undertaken not to sell its shares before March 23 1994.
