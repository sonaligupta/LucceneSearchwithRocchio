FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: British Gas warns of 'period of
instability'


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


Pre-tax profits at British Gas in the first quarter will be similar to those
of last year. But the underlying trend is downwards and the full-year
outcome will be lower than 1993 after an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.65bn
is stripped out.
The shares fell 15p to 280p.
Mr Richard Giordano, taking the chair at the annual meeting in Birmingham
for the first time since his appointment last January, predicted a period of
instability, as the group restructured.
This would lead to a drop in service, although that service 'will stack up
well compared with what will be offered by competitors,' he said.
'I am under no illusion that morale will be high during the process of
restructuring'.
Earlier, he had warned that 'thousands of British Gas managers and workers
will have to learn new ways of doing business and in a relatively short
time. It will not be accomplished without stress and conflict.'
British Gas made the exceptional charge in its accounts in the year to
December 31 to cope with the cost of closures and 25,000 redundancies.
The effect was to plunge the group, on a current cost basis, to a loss of
Pounds 613m. Profits before exceptionals were Pounds 1.07bn.
Mr Giordano said 1994 profits would be below this level as the group was
squeezed by competition and the effect of regulation. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 898m were indicated for the first quarter.
British Gas unveiled a new logo at the AGM, 'a new corporate identity,' Mr
Giordano said.
He was quick to add, in view of the heavy expense incurred by BT on a
similar exercise, that introduction of the logo, created by Coley Porter
Bell, would cost up to Pounds 3m.
