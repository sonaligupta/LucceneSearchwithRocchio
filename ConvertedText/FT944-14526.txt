FT  22 OCT 94 / Endangered species: New corporate investors threaten the
traditional Lloyd's Name


   By RALPH ATKINS


Having lost 'an astonishingly large sum of money' at Lloyd's of London, Mr
Glenie Joel, a 65 year-old retired soldier, is reluctant to offer financial
advice. But he does have one tip: 'I certainly wouldn't suggest that anyone
went into Lloyd's'
In the past, becoming a Name at Lloyds, as Mr Joel did in 1988, appeared an
attractive investment with considerable tax advantages. Today, with the
insurance market having incurred enormous losses, the number of Names is
shrinking rapidly. With the arrival at Lloyd's of increasing numbers of
corporate investors, the future of the traditional Name looks still less
certain.
The introduction into Lloyd's of capital from companies rather than
individuals should take a step forward in the next few weeks when Wellington
Underwriting announces that it has capital in place for a UK stock-market
listing. By planning company to invest in a narrow range of Lloyd's
insurance syndicates, it will be the closest a listed company has come to
mimicking the role of individual Names in providing capital to underwrite
insurance policies.
There is one crucial distinction, however. Whereas Names joined underwriting
syndicates on the basis of unlimited liability - and were vulnerable down to
their last collar stud, the maximum losses of corporate investors are
capped.
The emergence of the new listed Lloyd's companies raises the question of why
prudent investors should want to invest again in Lloyd's on an unlimited
basis. 'Unlimited liability is going to go,' says Mr John Mays of the
Merrett Names Association, a group representing other Names who have lost
money.
Unlimited liability offers high gearing - Names can underwrite policies
paying premiums up to five times the value of their investment. In good
years, this gearing level can mean high profits. However, the downside is
illustrated by the fate of thousands of Feltrim and Gooda Walker Names, who
have lost a total of more than Pounds 1bn and are chasing compensation
through the courts.
Even without Lloyd's recent troubles, the traditional Name looked
anachronistic. Some in the industry believe that unlimited liability is
legal nonsense because nobody has unlimited assets.
At the same time, the organisational structure of Lloyd's - developed in the
17th century to provide simple marine insurance policies - is unlikely to be
appropriate in an increasingly competitive market.
The tax advantages of becoming a UK Name have also diminished as income tax
rates have fallen. Names could offset losses against marginal tax rates as
high as 98 per cent in the late 1970s, and 60 per cent in the mid-1980s when
Lloyd's membership was growing rapidly. With a top tax rate today of 40 per
cent, the attraction has fallen.
Tax benefits remain: for example Names can keep profits in 'special reserve'
funds, without paying tax, to use for paying future losses. But that has not
stopped Names leaving Lloyd's. In 1989 more than 31,000 Names were actively
underwriting. Next year the total may drop below 16,000.
Lloyd's management is not yet ready to declare the traditional Name defunct.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, believes the injection of corporate capital is
critical to Lloyd's future. But he is keen to respect Names' interests.
'I want a level playing field between old and new capital so that market
forces can dictate,' says Mr Rowland. There are two good reasons for being
fair to traditional investors at this stage.
First, the company investors are unproven. This year, the first in which
corporate capital has been allowed, 25 companies have invested about Pounds
900m in the market. Most have spread their funds across a broad range of
syndicates, sometimes as many as 100. Typically they are allowed to
underwrite premiums worth twice their investment, a level of gearing that
may not produce sufficient returns to entice investors. Under Lloyd's
acc-ounting rules, this year's underwriting profits will not begin to flow
until 1996.
Second, Na-mes will continue to provide most of Lloyd's fin-ances for some
years. Moreover, the high gearing is still attractive for some wealthy
individuals. To lessen the risks of unlimited liability, Lloyd's introduced
last year a 'high level stop-loss' scheme offering protection against
excessive losses.
Existing Names have an incentive to carry on trading - if they can afford
to. Though 1992 is expected to have been loss-making, 1993 is regarded as
having been profitable. Meanwhile relief is in sight from the problem of
outstanding US pollution and asbestosis claims dating from as far back as
the 1940s. Liabilities on policies underwritten by Names in 1985 or before
are expected by the end of next year to have been taken over by Newco, a
company set up by Lloyd's to 'ring fence' the so-called 'old years' problem.
This should mean many Names can finally rid themselves of the still
unquantified past losses.
The picture could, however, change considerably by 1996 or 1997 when
insurance may have entered a cyclical downturn. 'Before 2000 most of us who
are still underwriting will be doing so with limited liability,' says Mr
Robert Saunders, director at accountancy and banking company Smith &
Williamson.
By then the wider repercussions of introducing corporate capital will also
have been felt. Corporate investors may want big changes to the Lloyd's
underwriting system, and it could become hard for Lloyd's to balance the
interests of companies and individuals on unlimited liability. The unlimited
liability Name may become an endangered species.
