FT  20 APR 91 / Briefcase, Q&A: Lost in the wash


I HAVE recently sold 'units' in two offshore bond funds. Both are managed so
as to qualify as distributor funds. The contract notes show that the sale
proceeds include a certain amount of accrued income. I have been under the
impression that these funds are not covered by the anti-washing, accrued
income, legislation. Am I wrong or is there some other reason for these
details being given?
The accrued income is likely to be taxable as income under part II of
Schedule 28 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (Disposals
involving an equalisation element) These rules originate from schedule 20 to
the Finance Act 1984 and are older than the accrued income scheme (which
originated in the 1985 Finance Act.)
You should find the text of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (as
amended up to last year) in a local reference library, in, for example, the
British Tax Encyclopedia.
