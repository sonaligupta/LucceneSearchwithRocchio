FT  13 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail sales data propel Dow
higher

NEWS of stronger-than-expected retail sales and a surprising bond market
rally propelled US share prices to big gains yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.08 at 3,684.51. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended 2.75 higher at 465.39, while
the Amex composite finished 1.62 higher at 479.60, and the Nasdaq composite
up 0.36 at 779.34. Trading volume on the NYSE was 323m shares.
Prices moved higher from the opening bell as investors bought stocks in
reaction to the commerce department's announcement that retail sales had
risen 1.5 per cent in October. Analysts had been expecting a 1 per cent
rise.
The figures were the latest in an increasingly long line of economic data
that has proved stronger than expected, supporting the impression that the
economy has been growing this autumn at a pace substantially faster than in
the first half of the year.
Sentiment was also aided by the surprising reaction of the bond market to
the retail sales data. Normally, signs of economic strength depress bonds,
but yesterday bond prices rose sharply after posting brief early declines.
The gains were put down to demand from dealers, who believed recent declines
had made bond prices attractive again, at least for the short-term.
Tobacco companies were widely sought after Philip Morris said that it would
match the cigarette price increases unveiled earlier this week by its main
rival, RJR Nabisco. The prices increases have raised hopes among investors
that the damaging price war between cigarette makers has ended. Philip
Morris climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59, RJR Nabisco added Dollars  3/8
at Dollars 7 1/4 and American Brands rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 .
Economically-sensitive stocks were mostly higher, especially forestry
product companies. Louisiana-Pacific rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 ,
Georgia-Pacific put on Dollars 4 at Dollars 74 1/8 and International Paper
firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 .
Digital Equipment rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 after Goldman Sachs
opened its coverage of the stock by rating the shares a "trading buy'. With
the same recommendation, however, IBM eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 .
Best Buy plunged Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 49 5/8 in heavy trading as
investors continued to sell the stock on concern that the company will
suffer from price competition from its chief rival in the electronic
appliance retail business, Circuit City.

TORONTO ended a record-breaking week by closing at yet another all-time
high. Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index was up 11.52
points to 4,302.78. Over the week the index gained about 101 points.
