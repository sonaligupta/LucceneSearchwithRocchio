FT  19 APR 91 / UK hotel group hit hard by Gulf war


   By DAVID CHURCHILL, Leisure Industries Correspondent


TRUSTHOUSE FORTE, Britain's biggest hotelier, was hit hard by the Gulf war
and UK recession with pre-tax profits falling 27 per cent, from Pounds 260m
to Pounds 190m for the financial year ended 31 January 1991. This was on a
sales increase of just 7 per cent to Pounds 2.64bn.
THF has reacted to the downturn in trade by cutting more than 1,000
administrative jobs out of a total workforce of 100,000 over the past year
as well as pruning other costs.
Although the results were at the bottom end of City forecasts, the impact of
the war and recession had been anticipated and the shares closed 4p down at
268p.
Speculation now centres on THF's plans to create a new brand structure next
month for its UK hotels which is likely to include a change of corporate
name to Forte, dropping the Trusthouse part of the name used since 1970.
Mr Rocco Forte, THF's chief executive, yesterday declined to confirm or deny
the impending name change. Analysts believe the switch to the Forte name is
needed to create a stronger overseas image for the hotel group.
Mr Forte said yesterday that trading in the first half of the financial year
had held up well, but had fallen away in the second half. In December and
January alone he estimated that profits fell more than Pounds 12m.
After a low point of 35 per cent occupancy levels reached during the war in
January, THF's hotel occupancy has risen significantly since then. London
hotels now have an average occupancy level of 65 per cent to 70 per cent -
about the level expected for this time of year - although provincial hotels
are still running at a level of 55 to 58 per cent.
Trading profit in THF's hotels division - which operates a total of 840
hotels worldwide - fell by 5 per cent to Pounds 160m on sales 7 per cent
higher at Pounds 913m.
The acquisition of the Crest chain in May last year added some Pounds 4m to
profits after expenses.
Restaurant operations, which include the Harvester and Kentucky Fried
Chicken chains, produced trading profits 3 per cent higher to Pounds 73m on
sales 8 per cent up at Pounds 618m. Contract catering operations, achieved
trading profits up 8 per cent to Pounds 41m on sales 9 per cent higher at
Pounds 1.05bn.
The THF board is recommending a final dividend of 7.16p per share, unchanged
on last year. This brings total dividends for the year to 9.91p (9.66p).
