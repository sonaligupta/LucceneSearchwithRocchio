   By PAUL TAYLOR


Sanderson Electronics, the computer software and hardware company which is
also the sponsor of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, yesterday reported a
27 per cent increase in full-year profits, helped by acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 rose from Pounds 3.33m to Pounds
4.23m on turnover up 44 per cent to Pounds 34m (Pounds 23.6m).
Earnings per share increased to 7.3p (6.3p).
Sanderson paid a first interim dividend of 1.35p in February and second
interim dividend of 1.5p in July, making 2.85p (2.48p) for the year. The
company said yesterday it would pay a first interim dividend of 1.6p in
February. The shares closed up 2p at 86p.
Sanderson, which has expanded to 15 offices in the UK as well as operations
in Australia, New Zealand and east Asia, reported operating profits of
Pounds 4.31m (Pounds 3.59m) while interest costs fell to Pounds 82,000
(Pounds 267,000).
Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said the majority of the 11 UK operating
subsidiaries had performed well. He added: 'All three UK acquisitions
contributed to this year's profit.
'Annual recurring revenues from software licence fees and service and
support contracts provided turnover of over Pounds 134m during the year and
covered 72 per cent of overheads. We have continued to invest substantial
amounts in the development of our open system application software
packages.'
