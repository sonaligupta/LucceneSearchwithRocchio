FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Thermal imaging puts out the
fire


   By CLIVE COOKSON


   THERMAL IMAGING cameras


well known for helping rescue workers to find survivors after earthquakes
and other disasters - are being adapted to give early warning of fires,
writes Clive Cookson.
Check Security Systems of Basildon, Essex, has introduced an infra-red
imaging system for installation in open yards where large amounts of
inflammable material such as paper are stored. The camera scans the site
continuously and its output is processed by a video analyser which is
programmed to distinguish the heat of an incipient fire from normal
temperature changes.
The system can resolve heat only 2 deg C above background and can give an
alarm before smoke and flames are visible. Although it costs Pounds 15,000
to install, the company says this is cheaper in the long run than employing
a security guard to look out for signs of fire.
