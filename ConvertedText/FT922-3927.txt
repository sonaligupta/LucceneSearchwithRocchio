Peter Godwin reports from Indonesia, the country with the fourth largest
population in the world in BBC2's often excellent foreign affairs series
Assignment (7.45). Spread over a thousand islands, the nation is determined
to become an industrial giant and a major world power, but there are doubts
about how long President Suharto can retain his position.
There is no mistaking the influence of ITV's original series of The
Comedians which began in 1971 and gave prominence to such stand-up comics as
Stan Boardman, Frank Carson, Bernard Manning, Tom O'Connor, Mike Reid, Roy
Walker and Charlie Williams. A new series begins at 8.30 and the 30 new
comedians include a woman, Pauline Daniels, disabled Tony Gerrard who works
from a wheelchair, Roy Walker's son Phil, Scotsman Eddie Devine and,
youngest of the bunch, Jimmy Bright, who is 21.
This season's passion for documentaries which take the lid off sports
management and economics continues in More Than A Game (10.50 BBC1). which
looks at agents, sponsors, and television itself which is now removing major
sporting occasions from the public domain.
