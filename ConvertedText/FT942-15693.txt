FT  14 APR 94 / Publishing of Bank's papers is welcomed


   By DAVID OWEN


The decision to publish the minutes of the monthly meetings between the
chancellor and the governor was broadly welcomed by politicians.
Downing Street said the measure was meant to introduce greater transparency
and promote a better understanding of the way in which monetary policy is
made.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the minutes proved that his claims
of a rift between the chancellor and the governor were true.
There was 'confusion and disarray' over the government's economic policy, he
said. He added: 'These minutes leave the chancellor as someone who is
exposed and who does not know where he is going in economic policy.'
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour City spokesman, said the decision would be
welcomed provided that future minutes were 'full and extensive'.
Mr Giles Radice, a senior Labour member of the Treasury and civil service
select committee, said it was a 'useful improvement'. Mr Nigel Forman, a
Tory member of the committee, said it was 'an excellent step forward'.
Mrs Teresa Gorman, the Tory Euro-sceptic who is a frequent critic of the
Treasury, said the move would 'help clear away a few cobwebs'. Mr Alan
Beith, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said publication should
'discourage bad interest rate decisions'.
