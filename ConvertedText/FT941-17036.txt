FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: Belgacom, Pactel start mobile
phone network

Belgacom, Belgium's state-owned telephone company, and Pacific Telesis
International of the US, yesterday launched a mobile phone network for
Belgium and promised even closer co-operation.
The network, which started operating on January 1, is the fruit of a
five-month alliance, the first between a public European telephone operator
and a private cellular phone company. The launch strengthens another link in
the growing network of strategic alliances between telecoms groups in Europe
and the US.
PacTel, part of Pacific Telesis - one of the seven regional US telecoms
companies - said yesterday it would go on to build a formal joint venture
with Belgacom. PacTel will own 25 per cent of the subsidiary, and expects to
conclude a deal by the middle of this year.
Mr Jan Neels, PacTel International's president and chief executive, said the
subsidiary would be responsible for the digital 'GSM' mobile phone system
launched yesterday, and Belgium's analogue cellular network, which could be
phased out as clients switch to the Europe-wide GSM network.
'If there is an opportunity, which is a good fit for Belgacom and ourselves,
we could work together in other areas . . . in Belgium or outside Belgium,'
added Mr Neels, a Belgian citizen. He said the development of paging
services might be one such opportunity.
Mr Bessel Kok, Belgacom's chief executive, said the GSM system - Proximus -
had signed up more than 2,500 subscribers since January 1.
The European Commission is still examining Belgian legislation which
prevents a competitor entering the mobile phone market, which it believes
could be incompatible with European competition rules.
