FT  25 AUG 92 / London traffic has speeded up, says survey


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


TRAFFIC SPEEDS in inner London appear to have risen for the first time in
many years, according to the Department of Transport's annual survey of
traffic volumes and speeds in the capital published yesterday.
Provisional estimates show that speeds in inner London increased by about
1.5mph between 1989 and last year, against the trend of slowly falling
average speeds recorded since the survey began in 1968.
The daytime average is just over 12mph for inner London, though the figure
is rather lower in central London at just over 10mph.
Traffic levels appear to have remained the same during this period, after 13
years of average growth of 1 per cent a year.
The average traffic speed in the central area is uniform between 7am and
7pm, although there remain significant peaks in the volume of traffic in the
morning and evening rush hours.
The survey suggests that the constant average speed during the day is caused
by factors such as on-street parking keeping the speed between the rush
hours as low as the speed caused by heavy traffic at peak times.
About 70 per cent of vehicles parked on central London streets are
commercial, the survey says. The number of heavy-goods vehicles entering
London has declined since the completion of the M25, but light-goods traffic
has continued to grow rapidly through the late 1980s at an average of about
5 per cent a year.
