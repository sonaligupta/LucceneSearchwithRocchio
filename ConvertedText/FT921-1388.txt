FT  24 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Argos


Judging by yesterday's results, the only thing holding Argos back last year
was the lack of confidence among its customers. But the effect was severe
enough to reduce pre-tax profits by 17 per cent. Underlying sales volumes
fell, and the group's cost base proved relatively inflexible despite the
best efforts of management.
That was not unlike the experience of rival retailers, so the market may
have been unduly sceptical about Argos's premium rating - its shares
underperformed the stores sector by a fifth over the last year. What
originally singled the group out was the quality of its management and a
relatively protected position in the market. Neither has changed. And it is
hard to quibble with Argos's responses to the recession.
It has Pounds 180m of cash in hand, so can afford to be patient. The new
Chesterman furniture stores will add spice to the standard fare of
controlled expansion via new catalogue stores. If the furniture business
works, Argos will have a broader base for growth. Should it fail, the price
will be no more than Pounds 10m.
There are also reasons for mild optimism in the longer-term about the better
end of the retailing sector. Because costs have begun to move slowly in
favour of retailers, there is real scope for operating margins to improve.
Consumers may remain nervous for a while yet, but even a modest improvement
in sales will have a gratifying effect on profits. The trick for investors
will be to select those best positioned to benefit. Although its shares are
still on an above-average historic multiple of 18, Argos deserves to be on
the list.
