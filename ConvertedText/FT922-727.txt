FT  26 JUN 92 / Move on secrecy


THE government signalled its determination yesterday to open Whitehall up to
greater public scrutiny by announcing that secret intelligence papers would
no longer be withheld automatically from publication under the 30-year rule.
Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the drive for more open
government, said on BBC Radio 4 that some documents relating to the top
secret Joint Intelligence Committee could be published.
