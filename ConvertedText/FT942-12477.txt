FT  29 APR 94 / People: Jones lands on GKN's board


Alan Jones, the chairman of Westland who unsuccessfully defended the company
against a hostile bid from GKN recently, has now accepted a place on GKN's
board. Jones, who is widely credited with turning round the ailing
helicopter-maker, will continue to run Westland's operations.
In contrast to its difficulties in the 1980s, Westland now has good order
prospects, notably for British Army attack and RAF support helicopters.
At the start of the bid in February Sir David Lees, GKN's chairman, said he
did not intend to make any management changes if he won control of Westland,
and offered Jones a place on GKN's board.
As the bid became more contentious, however, the relationship between the
two cooled noticeably. Any differences now seem to have been resolved.
Although Jones joined Westland as chief executive in 1989, he had only the
briefest tenure as chairman. He took the chair when Sir Leslie Fletcher
retired at the agm on February 17 this year and finally conceded defeat to
GKN's bid on March 31.
Jones had been involved in bids before. In 1989 he resigned as head of
Plessey's defence business to move to Westland at the height of the hostile
bid from GEC and Siemens. His departure was seen as weakening Plessey's
defences.
