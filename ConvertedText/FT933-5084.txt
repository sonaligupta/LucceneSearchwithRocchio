FT  06 SEP 93 / US Iraq arms probe will go on despite trial move

THE CLINTON administration is moving ahead with a broadened investigation of
the US role in Iraq's arms procurement network and has not ruled out the
possibility of naming a special prosecutor, a senior Justice Department
official said at the weekend.
Mr John Hogan, a special assistant to Miss Janet Reno, the US
attorney-general, said that last week's decision to cancel the Iraqi loans
trial involving the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL) should not be seen as ending US efforts to probe arms-to-Iraq charges.
'My investigation is an on-going one dealing with the Iraqi procurement
network and concerning anyone involved, whether in goverment or out, whether
a current or former official,' he said. Mr Hogan, who also heads the Clinton
administration's inter-agency BNL task force, stressed that recent US media
reports suggesting a special prosecutor had been ruled out were wrong. He
said: 'No determination has been made yet.'
Democratic members of Congress last year demanded the naming of a special
prosecutor to examine allegations that Bush administration officials had
been involved in criminal wrong-doing in connection with US policies towards
Iraq. The Bush administration rejected the idea shortly before leaving
office, but President Bill Clinton promised that Miss Reno would re-evaluate
the charges.
Last Thursday, an agreement was reached allowing Mr Christopher Drogoul, the
former BNL Atlanta manager, to plead guilty to only three of the original
347 charges against him.
Mr Drogoul, who made Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) of loans that helped to
finance Iraq's nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, had been due to
stand trial this week.
