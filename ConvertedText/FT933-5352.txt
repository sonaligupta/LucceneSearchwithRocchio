FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Psion restricted to Pounds 1.07m
by US marketing investment


   By PAUL TAYLOR


PSION, the hand-held computer, software and data communications equipment
manufacturer, reported a marginal increase in interim pre-tax profits
despite a 9 per cent advance in turnover and volume sales gains in most
markets.
The USM-quoted group, which has been investing heavily in its US marketing
operations, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.07m for the six months to
June 30, compared with Pounds 1.05m.
The figures were a little below market expectations and the shares, which
have risen sharply in recent weeks, dropped 9p to 115p.
Mr David Potter, chairman, described the results as 'a satisfactory
performance despite continuing depressed market conditions in Europe'.
He added: 'We have made a substantial investment in marketing in the US and
this, together with a recent reorganisation, has resulted in significant
progress in that market.'
The group has more than tripled the number of retail outlets in the US
market to 650 and expects to have secured 1,000 by the year end.
In the latest period gross profit margins recovered, from the second half of
last year, to 40 per cent, but the marketing investment in the US, totalling
more than Pounds 600,000, held back profits at the pre-tax level.
Earnings per share increased to 3.41p (3.16p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.
Turnover increased to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 16.5m) spurred by particularly
strong sales of data communications products in the UK, which grew by 30 per
cent, and of hand-held computers in the US which rose 38 per cent to more
than Pounds 2m.
A 25 per cent sales increase in Germany and the Netherlands helped offset an
11 per cent decline in sales elsewhere in Europe.
Mr Potter said sales of the Series 3 range were strong in the first quarter
but that demand in Europe in the second quarter was weak.
He added that sales in the UK doubled after the company cut prices in June.
