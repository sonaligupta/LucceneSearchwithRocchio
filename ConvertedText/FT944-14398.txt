FT  22 OCT 94 / Moslem sect leader recants


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


Al Arqam, the Moslem sect banned by the Malaysian government, was yesterday
formulating its response to a TV appearance by its leader, Mr Ashaari
Mohamad, in which he appeared to go back on his beliefs. Mr Ashaari,
answering questions from a panel of Malaysian Islamic scholars, admitted
deviationist beliefs and promised to try to change the minds of followers
whom he had misled. Al Arqam, which says it has 100,000 followers in
Malaysia and more in the region, was banned in August for spreading what the
government called deviationist Islamic teachings. About 55 per cent of
Malaysia's population are Moslems. Mr Ashaari and six other Al Arqam members
were arrested last month under Malaysia's Internal Security Act.
