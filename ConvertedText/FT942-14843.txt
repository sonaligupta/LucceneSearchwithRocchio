FT  19 APR 94 / Native title fears dismissed

Moody's, the US-based rating agency, said yesterday that it believed the
impact on Western Australia of the new federal native title legislation 'may
prove to be less than feared', Nikki Tait writes from Sydney.
The new legislation, which came into force on January 1, acknowledged that
Aboriginal people could possess native title rights over land in Australia
and set up a system for deciding land claims, and deciding on appropriate
compensation where the land had been allocated for other purposes. Western
Australia is thought to be the state most affected.
Mr Laurie Brereton, Australia's federal transport minister, said yesterday
that he was in favour of selling 'a very limited number' of the nation's
airports, currently under the control of the Federal Airports Corporation,
into the private sector. He put Melbourne's Tullamarine airport at the top
of the list of airports which might be sold.
