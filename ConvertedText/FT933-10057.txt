   BEIJING


CHINA is to campaign against tax evasion and fraud as part ofattempts to
restore order to its chaotic economy, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
A state circular released yesterday demands that business enterprises should
no longer receive extensions to tax-exempt periods. It also warns against
tax cuts.
Companies claiming tax concessions for exports will be closely scrutinised.
as will the private businesses that have mushroomed throughout China and
enterprises involving foreigners. Tax offices are urged to increase efforts
to collect tax from 'self-employed businesses'.
