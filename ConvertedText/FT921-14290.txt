FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: End of the line for MGN presses?


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


FIVE SOPHISTICATED colour printing presses worth about Pounds 30m are being
stored in a disused coach terminus in Glasgow - as a result of the collapse
of the Maxwell publishing empire.
The Koenig & Bauer presses, capable of producing 80-page newspapers with top
quality colour, were destined for Mirror Group Newspaper's Scottish titles,
the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail.
They were ordered in the days when the late Mr Robert Maxwell was still
expanding his interests.
Now they are stranded a couple of streets away from the Daily Record
headquarters at Anderson's Quay under 24-hour security in a covered section
of the terminus.
There seems little chance in the foreseeable future that MGN will be able to
afford the Pounds 50m-plus needed to build a new press hall and install the
presses.
Meanwhile, the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, which had advertising and
circulation revenues of Pounds 76m in 1990, have to pay leasing charges on
the presses of more than Pounds 6m a year. Three belong to Barclays and the
other two to the Royal Bank of Scotland.
It seems likely that their future will not be determined until the future of
MGN itself is decided when the administrator of the Maxwell private
interests manages to sell the 51 per cent now effectively owned by the
banks.
The five presses were ordered in the days when Mr Maxwell had grand visions
of printing The European in Paris and becoming a leading contract printer in
France. When that came to nothing, the presses were then diverted to
Anderson's Quay.
