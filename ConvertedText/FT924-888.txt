FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo cuts N Sea holdings - Shares rally as
rationalisation programme continues


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


LASMO, the independent oil and gas exploration company, announced the sale
of Dollars 145.5m of assets in the North Sea and Indonesia yesterday, taking
the value of disposals this year to Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 980m).
The company agreed to sell its 8.52 per cent interest in the T-block fields
in the North Sea to a subsidiary of Murphy Oil Corporation in the US for
Dollars 100m.
It also sold other smaller interests in the North Sea and Indonesia as part
of a programme of rationalising its asset portfolio and selling off many of
the peripheral developments it acquired with the takeover of Ultramar a year
ago.
The company indicated yesterday that it will continue its disposal plans
next year when it expects to achieve sales of more than Dollars 150m.
Lasmo sold off Ultramar's downstream refining interests in North America
earlier this year for Dollars 1.13bn.
Mr Chris Greentree, Lasmo's chairman, said the latest asset disposals will
reduce the company's debt to equity ratio by some 10 per cent. Analysts
estimate Lasmo's gearing level to be about 85 per cent.
The company's shares were stronger yesterday as the City renewed its hopes
that Lasmo would not cut its dividend in spite of weak oil prices and high
capital expenditure. The shares rose 9p to 151p.
Mr Greentree said the company will cut its capital expenditure by 35 per
cent next year from Pounds 132m to Pounds 90m against a background of weak
oil prices. Lasmo will also slash its development spending from Pounds 326m
to Pounds 240m.
'The oil price is at its lowest for 20 years and all our exploration and
production and development projects have to meet low oil price criteria or
we just won't do them,' Mr Greentree said.
Lasmo has built in a price of Dollars 19.50 per barrel for an average oil
price on which to base its plans next year.
Lasmo shares have been extremely weak in recent months as the City became
concerned about this year's uncovered dividend and persistent rumours about
problems the company had uncovered at Ultramar.
But Mr Steve Turner at Smith New Court expects oil production at the company
to grow by 40 per cent up to 1996: 'which means the company can grow out of
its financial difficulties,' he said.
Lasmo says its oil output will increase from 185,000 barrels a day (b/d) to
190,000 b/d next year.
