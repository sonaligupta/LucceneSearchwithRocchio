FT  06 JUN 92 / Letter: Stumped for an answer on lbw


   From R A REEVES


Sir, Teresa McLean ('Umpires need to put their foot down,' May 30) misses
the stumps herself in consideration of lbw decisions. I recall a number of
years ago that some experiments were carried out at Lords with slow motion
cameras and other devices. If memory serves me correctly, less than half the
balls which would have met the stipulation about pitching in line or outside
the off stump etc., did in fact go on to hit the wickets.
The first and most crucial consideration to be made by an umpire is: 'Would
the ball have definitely hit the wicket?' If the answer is 'no', any further
deliberation is unnecessary. If yes, then consideration of where the ball
pitched and hit the batsman are taken into account.
At the Oval, both Inzamam and Miandad were given out when playing well
forward. When the ball has another six or seven feet to go before reaching
the stumps there is clearly much more doubt about the outcome and both these
batmen could consider themselves unlucky.
