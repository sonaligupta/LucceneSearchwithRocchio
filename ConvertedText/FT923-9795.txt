FT  03 AUG 92 / Sniper's victims


A child cries behind the bullet-holed windscreen of a bus in which two
children were killed by a sniper in Sarajevo. The bus was evacuating orphans
from the besieged Bosnian capital to go to a refuge in Germany when it came
under fire as Moslem forces battled to break the Serb hold on the city.
