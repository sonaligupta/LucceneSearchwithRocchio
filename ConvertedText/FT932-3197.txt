FT  15 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bullion prices ebb after rapid
rise


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


GOLD'S PRICE dropped by Dollars 7.20 a troy ounce to close at Dollars 363.95
in London yesterday, just 7 per cent above the Dollars 340 level where it
languished in late April before a concerted effort by investors Sir James
Goldsmith and Mr George Soros boosted the market.
But many analysts suggest gold is simply pausing for breath after its hectic
rise and eventually will continue upwards. 'Gold is still in pretty good
shape. We expected some consolidation after its meteoric rise,' said Mr
Graham Roberts, director of mining research at Carr Kitcat & Aitken, part of
the Banque Indosuez Group. He said gold would reach Dollars 380 to Dollars
385 an ounce by the end of the summer and be at Dollars 400 'within 12
months. But I can't go along with those who suggest Dollars 450 or Dollars
500 is achievable.'
Yesterday's near-2 per cent fall in gold's price in Europe followed volatile
trading in New York late on Friday when it was driven down by
options-related selling, which triggered further selling by investors
wanting to cut their losses.
Sentiment was also affected by the release of US producer price statistics
for May, indicating inflationary pressures in the States were easing.
Mr Roberts pointed out that Dollars 362 an ounce was an important technical
support point for gold and if this was breached, the next solid support was
at Dollars 355. 'But if it goes below Dollars 350, then we are back at
square one.' He said the greatest danger to a further price rise was that
producers might start to sell gold forward again because they were
disappointed that the fast upward momentum had not been maintained.
Conditions in the gold market washed over to other precious metals
yesterday. Consequently, silver's price closed in London 14 US cents, or
nearly 3.5 per cent down, at Dollars 4 a troy ounce, while platinum
experienced a drop of Dollars 4.25 an ounce to close at Dollars 382.50.
