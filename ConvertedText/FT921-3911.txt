FT  12 MAR 92 / Observer: Downs and ups


Judging by yesterday's movement, the stock market seems to have made up its
mind that the government has muffed the Budget and lost the next election
already.
However, the reaction could be premature if Kleinwort Benson's historical
election statistics are any guide. In the 13 elections since 1945, the FT's
All Share index has risen on average by 1.4 per cent between the
announcement of the general election and polling day. On the six occasions
that Labour has won, it has fallen by an average of 0.1 per cent.
Admittedly, the average fall the day after a Labour victory is 2.6 per cent.
But don't despair. Twelve months after a Labour victory the stock market has
risen by an average 14.4 per cent, or nearly four times more than after a
Tory win.
