FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EFM launches trust for Asian markets


   By BETHAN HUTTON


Edinburgh Fund Managers is to launch an investment trust specialising in
smaller companies in emerging Asian markets, to be known as the Edinburgh
New Tiger Trust.
It hopes to raise Pounds 50m through a placing and offer for subscription of
ordinary shares of 5p issued at 50p, with one warrant attached to every five
shares.
The offer period is expected to be January 29 to February 18, with first
dealings on February 24.
The new fund's managers will concentrate on the emerging markets of south
and south-east Asia, including India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka as well as the
more usual Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, China and the
Philippines.
Companies in the more established markets of Hong Kong and Singapore will be
considered if they have exposure to emerging Asian economies.
The fund will invest in smaller companies with market capitalisation of less
than Dollars 500m (Pounds 340m) with the aim of achieving long-term capital
growth.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said it believed smaller companies should outperform
their larger counterparts as their operational flexi-bility should allow
them to exploit opportunities more easily.
The same investment team already manages the EFM Dragon fund, an investment
trust covering east Asia excluding Japan.
