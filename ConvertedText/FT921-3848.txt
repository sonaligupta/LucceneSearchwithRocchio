FT  12 MAR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Prices at wool sales in Australia this week were unchanged or a little
cheaper and it is now recognised that the strong rise in February reached an
upper limit by the beginning of March. There has been no major decline but
inevitably the general reaction in wool using markets is to wait and see
what happens before coming to further major buying decisions. The UK Budget
has useful measures designed to help small businesses but its impact on
recovery and interest rates is now seen as dependent on the General
Election. The AWC Market indicator was 638 cents on March 11th.
