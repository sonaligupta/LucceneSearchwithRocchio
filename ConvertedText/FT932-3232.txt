FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Investors rush to sell Ferruzzi
stakes


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


ITALY'S troubled Ferruzzi group yesterday took another mauling on the stock
market yesterday as investors rushed to sell their holdings in the
debt-laden company.
The Milan stock market failed to make a price in Montedison, Ferruzzi's main
industrial subsidiary, after a torrent of sales. Stock in the Ferruzzi
Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company fell almost 13 per cent to L662.3 from
L760.1 on Friday, while opening prices for Montedison showed a 10 per cent
collapse to L880 from L975.
The drop in values has wiped about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.35bn) off the
capitalisation of Ferfin and its subsidiaries in the past week as investors
reacted to revelations of the group's L31,000bn borrowings and decision to
hand its fate to a group of banks.
Last week, Mr Enzo Berlanda, chairman of the Consob stock exchange and
companies watchdog, defended the decision not to suspend Ferruzzi group
shares following conflicting reports about its indebtedness.
Mr Berlanda argued that suspending Ferruzzi group shares in Milan would have
been pointless without similar action by supervisors on other stock markets
where parts of the group are quoted. Montedison shares trade on five
European bourses, apart from Milan, as well as in New York.
The banks involved in the Ferruzzi rescue talks, which include Istituto
Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano and Banca
Commerciale Italiana, have all declined to comment on the negotiations, in
spite of the growing pressure for a statement as a result of the share price
collapse.
Shares in some of five banks forming the group's creditors' committee have
suffered, with stock in Mediobanca, leading the rescue talks, falling 5.7
per cent to L15,350 yesterday.
