FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Excalibur dives 73% to Pounds 1.11m but
strengthens balance sheet


   By PETER PEARSE


EXCALIBUR, the jewellery, merchandising and engineering group, said
yesterday that the year to April 30 had contained bad and good news,
suggesting the good - on the balance sheet - outweighed the bad - on the
profit and loss account.
Pre-tax profits tumbled 73 per cent to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 4.14m), after a
Pounds 1.6m exceptional charge for written-down jewellery stocks.
Sales in the jewellery division fell 11 per cent to Pounds 16.4m. Giftware
and merchandising lifted sales 11 per cent to Pounds 22.1m. The crystal and
pewterware companies were flat, but Pic-A-Tape, the music distributor,
achieved record profits.
Sales in the aerospace division grew 9 per cent to Pounds 10.1m with its
four companies all in profit but with slipped margins. Sales in the
industrial side advanced 28 per cent to Pounds 16.5m, though trading losses
were incurred.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 65.1m (Pounds 60.7m). Earnings were down at
1.3p (6.2p) per share and the proposed final dividend is reduced to 0.6p for
a total of 1p (1.8p).
The group was at pains to stress the good news on the balance sheet. All its
borrowings have been restructured away from short-term to long-term
arrangements with fewer banks.
Working capital has been reduced by 20 per cent and redeployed away from
jewellery and industrial to giftware and aerospace, which require additional
investment. Capital investment was maintained at Pounds 4.6m and gearing
held at 58 per cent.
COMMENT
With the jewellery market having shrunk by 40 per cent since the heady days
of 1989 and the industrial division in the wrong part of the cycle,
Excalibur needed its other two legs to stand on. Even though aerospace took
a double blow from Rolls-Royce, which decided to end its own raw materials
buying and switched from 30-day to 60-day credit, it has a good order book,
though it will have to claw back some margin. In giftware, Pic-A-Tape was
the star, though whether it can successfully break out of service stations
and into groceries remains to be seen. If the jewellery side needs no more
provisions, and that is a big 'if' with jewellery likely to be last out of
the recession, then Pounds 2m pre-tax can be expected this year, giving
earnings of 2.3p and a prospective multiple of about 7. Not expensive, not
exciting, but a recovery stock, though not yet.
