FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Cape shares fall despite 7% advance to
Pounds 6.5m


   By GEOFF DYER


Shares in Cape, the building products and industrial services group, fell 8p
to 223p yesterday after it announced a 6 per cent fall in sales at
continuing businesses.
Turnover on continuing operations - excluding acquisitions - dropped to
Pounds 111.3m, the main decline coming in the industrial services division.
Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, blamed falling demand for
insulation services.
A lower interest charge of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 600,000) helped overall
pre-tax profits to advance by 7 per cent to Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.1m). Total
turnover for the six months to September 30 was down 5 per cent at Pounds
113m (Pounds 119m).
Despite a 9 per cent drop in turnover from industrial services to Pounds 76m
(Pounds 83.6m), profits nudged up Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 3.4m. Mr
Farebrother said demand for insulation services, which had been particularly
poor in France, was not expected to pick up until 1996.
The French insulation subsidiary SOCAP made losses of Pounds 400,000 in the
first half, although it had been expected to break even. Similar losses are
expected in the second half. Last year SOCAP management was dismissed after
financial mis-statements were discovered. A further restructuring involving
30 redundancies is planned.
Operating profits from building and architectural products edged up to
Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4.1m) on sales 3 per cent higher at Pounds 36.5m (Pounds
35.3m). This was despite increased raw materials costs of 18 per cent for
steel and 40 per cent for pulp. UK sales in the second quarter were up for
the first time in four years.
The charge for compensation for industrial disease - a number of former
employees contracted asbestos-related illnesses - remained at Pounds
800,000. Mr Farebrother said the group had no US operations and did not face
any litigation claims.
Earnings per share and the interim dividend were unchanged at 7.6p and 3p.
