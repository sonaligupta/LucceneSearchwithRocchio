FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Digital Equipment agrees Dollars
400m sale to Quantum

   SAN FRANCISCO


Digital Equipment is selling substantial portions of its data storage
business to Quantum, a Silicon Valley computer disk drive manufacturer, for
approximately Dollars 400m.
The sale is the first in a series of divestitures planned by Digital as the
company 'downsizes' its operations in a struggle to improve its financial
performance.
Digital announced last week it would dispose of certain 'non-strategic'
assets and lay off 20,000 workers over the next 12 months.
Quantum, the world's largest disk drive manufacturer, will acquire Digital's
magnetic disk drive, tape drive, solid state disk, and thin-film heads
businesses.
The transaction also includes Digital's 81 per cent interest in Rocky
Mountain Magnetics, a leader in the development of magneto-resistive disk
drive technology, which is widely seen as an important technology for
increasing the data storage capacity of disk drives.
Digital will also sign a contract under which Quantum will supply a
substantial portion of Digital's internal hard disk drive requirements. The
terms of the supply agreement were not disclosed.
Quantum said the acquisition would enable it to become a significant force
in the high-capacity disk drive market. Its sales for the fiscal year ending
in March were Dollars 2.1bn.
'While these segments of our storage business unit have been highly
successful and represent some of the best technology in the world, this
agreement enables Digital to sharpen our focus on our core computer systems
and components businesses,' said Mr Robert Palmer, Digital's president and
chief executive.
There are around 5,000 regular and temporary employees in the Digital
businesses being purchased by Quantum.
Quantum will also buy Digital facilities in the US and Malaysia while
leasing others in the US and Indonesia.
