FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Fannie Mae posts 25th record
quarter


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) yesterday reported a
15 per cent increase in first-quarter profits to Dollars 510.5m.
It was the 25th consecutive quarter of record profits for the company, which
provides financing for US mortgage lenders.
Fannie Mae said it was able to post another record quarter in spite of
rising interest rates - which typically dampen demand for mortgages -
because of a strategy that is designed to minimise the effect of interest
rate movements on the company's earnings. Essentially, the strategy involves
balancing Fannie Mae's assets and liabilities so that there is very little
interest rate exposure.
The impact of rising interest rates was clearly seen in Fannie Mae's net
interest margin (the difference between the interest the company earns on
mortgage loans and the interest it pays to borrow money), which narrowed
from 143 basis points a year ago to 126 basis points.
Although its interest margin declined, Fannie Mae's net interest income
still rose 10 per cent to Dollars 664.4m, as its mortgage portfolio
increased to Dollars 197bn. A year earlier, the portfolio was worth Dollars
159bn.
The company's strong first quarter was also helped by a sharp drop in
extraordinary after-tax losses from the early retirement of debt to Dollars
8.3m, and by a 17 per cent increase in mortgage-backed securities guaranty
fees to Dollars 269.7m and a 57 per cent jump to Dollars 35.5m in fees
earned from the sale of Remics (real estate mortgage investment conduits).
Fannie Mae's acquisition of foreclosed single-family properties rose 14 per
cent to 3,122, while write-offs climbed from Dollars 30.5m to Dollars 53m,
primarily because of those related to the January earthquake in southern
California.
