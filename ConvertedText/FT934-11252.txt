FT  02 NOV 93 / Unions receive strong endorsement from BA chairman


UNIONS have received a strong endorsement from the Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman of British Airways.
In the GMB general union's magazine, Sir Colin says unions help motivation
and play a 'good role' at BA.
'British Airways is happy to work with the unions and there is no question
of derecognising them,' he says. 'Unions play an important role in the
company because they collectively represent the interests of the workforce.'
His comments were reinforced by Mrs Rhiannon Chapman, director of the
Industrial Society. Writing in the society's newsletter, published today,
she urges employers to resist the temptation afforded by legislation to
de-recognise unions and to treat them instead as a 'valuable avenue' for
solving problems.
She says it is easy to underestimate the value of a good, experienced union
representative in 'oiling the wheels' and solving day-to-day problems.
