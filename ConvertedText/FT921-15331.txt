FT  10 JAN 92 / Observer: No excuse


A footnote to yesterday's Lombard column on these pages about Robert
Maxwell. In 1970 Price Waterhouse prepared a report on the gross
over-statement of the profits and assets of the publicly-quoted Pergamon
Press. It was the backbone of the damning Board of Trade report on Maxwell.
The investigation was headed by a senior PW partner - Martin Harris. Since
1977 Harris has been a non-executive director of National Westminster Bank,
the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies. Observer is curious to
know whether NatWest ever listened to his wise counsel.
