FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: McDonald's rises 16% in first
period


   By KAREN ZAGOR


MCDONALD'S Corporation, the world's largest hamburger chain, yesterday
posted a 16 per cent improvement in first-quarter net earnings to Dollars
218.3m on sales which rose 6 per cent to Dollars 5.24bn.
In the same period of 1992, the company earned Dollars 187.4m on sales of
Dollars 4.92bn. Earnings per share rose 12 per cent in the latest quarter to
57 cents from 51 cents.
Revenues, which are less than sales because of franchising agreements, were
2 per cent higher at Dollars 1.65bn in the 1993 quarter. Operating income
advanced 5 per cent to Dollars 411.4m from Dollars 393.2m a year ago.
The Illinois-based company said earnings growth was constrained by bad
weather worldwide, weaker foreign currencies and 'the loss of one day, since
1992 was a leap year'.
McDonald's said its performance in 1993 'will keep us on the track of
achieving teens growth in earnings as measured over a five-year-period of
time'.
On Wall Street, shares in the company fell Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars
46 7/8 .
US sales grew 6 per cent in the quarter, while overseas sales were up 7 per
cent.
The company plans to extend its share purchase programme this year by
Dollars 200m, above the previously announced Dollars 500m.
