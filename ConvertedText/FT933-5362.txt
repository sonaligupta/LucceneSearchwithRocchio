FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Offshoot sale main factor in Microvitec's
rise to Pounds 0.57m


THE SALE of a lossmaking subsidiary was the main factor behind an
improvement in interim pre-tax profits at Microvitec, the Bradford-based
micro-electronic equipment and software group.
On turnover down from Pounds 25.5m to Pounds 18m, of which Pounds 16.1m
(Pounds 14.4m) related to continuing activities, profits at this USM-quoted
company for the first half of 1993 improved from Pounds 62,000 to Pounds
570,000.
In January the company sold Logitek Distribution to its management. Mr James
Bailey, chairman and chief executive said: 'The immediate benefits of this
were improved profits, a lower interest charge and the freedom to allow
management to concentrate on the core constituents of the business.'
Gearing was cut over the six months to end-June from 82 per cent to 47 per
cent. Interest charges fell from Pounds 377,000 to Pounds 141,000.
The pre-tax figure was also boosted by an exceptional credit of Pounds
196,000, the result of releasing a provision of Pounds 816,000 less the loss
on the sale of the distribution side of Pounds 620,000.
Mr Bailey said that perhaps the most exciting development during the period
was in Canada where the Silcom offshoot had experienced strong growth and
sales were expected to double in 1993 to CDollars 10m (Pounds 5.1m).
He added that display division continued to be successful in securing high
profile contracts.
Earnings per share came out at 0.8p (0.1p).
