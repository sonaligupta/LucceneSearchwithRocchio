FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airtours buys Hogg Robinson retail side


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


AIRTOURS, the UK tour operator that narrowly failed to acquire rival Owners
Abroad earlier this year, is to pay Pounds 25m for the retail business of
Hogg Robinson.
Added to the Pickfords travel agencies bought last September, the 214 Hogg
Robinson branches will give Airtours 550 outlets, second only to Lunn Poly
in the UK.
Airtours expects at least Pounds 5m of benefits in the first full year. This
will be derived from increased commissions charged to tour operators and
from the introduction of Hogg Robinson's foreign exchange facilities
throughout the Pickfords branches.
The purchase continues the process of Airtours becoming a vertically
integrated company within the holiday industry. Had Airtours successfully
bid for Owners Abroad, the group would still have expanded its retail chain.
Airtours raised Pounds 49.5m through the issue of convertible shares at the
time of the failed bid. With interest rates at current levels, the deal
would immediately enhance earnings per share, said Mr Harry Coe, finance
director.
Airtours has use of the Hogg Robinson and Pickfords names until 1995 and is
therefore expected to change the name of the entire chain.
Lunn Poly has about 20 per cent of the market; Pickfords and Hogg Robinson
Leisure will have about 12 per cent, ahead of Thomas Cook with 8 per cent.
Mr Coe said that Pickfords' commissions were on average one percentage point
higher than at Hogg Robinson and would be increased.
Hogg Robinson also came with a highly developed information technology
system. As a result Airtours would not need to spend so much upgrading the
Pickfords systems. The total systems cost was now expected to be no more
than Pounds 2.5m.
Airtours share price rose 5p to 323p.
