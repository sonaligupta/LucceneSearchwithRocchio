FT  28 JAN 94 / Hassan speeds business ventures in Morocco


   By FRANCIS GHILES


King Hassan of Morocco has established a committee to help foreign investors
who encounter problems setting up business in Morocco. The 'Comite de Suivi
et d'Impulsion des Investissements' (CISI) will include Morocco's leading
commercial banks and be chaired by Mr Mohamed Seqqat, central bank governor.
Moroccan officials say the CISI is not a substitute for existing ministries
but an effort to speed decisions by submitting problems directly to the head
of state, thereby simplifying a process taking up to eight months.
An important factor behind the fast-track committee is the growth of foreign
investment which last year reached Dollars 500m, (Pounds 333m), covering the
whole of the current account deficit. In 1992 and 1991, foreign investment
covered 50 per cent and 23 per cent respectively of the deficit.
The flow of investment from abroad is being encouraged by the privatisation
programme initiated 13 months ago. Observers in Casablanca expect that
programme to be accelerated in the next few months because of this year's
budget deficit, estimated at about Dollars 500m. The privatisation programme
brought the state a foreign income of Dollars 250m last year, a figure which
the authorities hope to boost to Dollars 340m in 1994.
The four petrol and oil products distribution companies are being
privatised. Petrom was sold to a Moroccan investor a few weeks ago while
Shell has just bought the distribution company which bears its name. The
Mobil and Total distribution networks are next on the list.
Other key privatisations this year will include four leading banks in which
the state owns more than a 50 per cent stake: Credit Industriel et Hotelier,
Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, Banque Populaire and Banque
Nationale du Commerce et de l'Industrie. But the state is expected to retain
a core holding of 33.3 per cent of shares in each institution.
The privatisation programme and recapitalisation of Moroccan companies have
boosted activity on the previously sleepy Casablanca stock exchange.
Transactions last year increased by 365 per cent to DH 25.7bn (Pounds
1.79bn).
