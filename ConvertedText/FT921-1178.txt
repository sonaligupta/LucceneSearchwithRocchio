FT  25 MAR 92 / Societies' mortgage lending falls


   By DAVID BARCHARD


NET MORTGAGE lending by building societies in February was the lowest for
any month since February 1987, according to figures published by the
Building Societies Association yesterday.
The societies lent Pounds 1.02bn net, down from Pounds 1.35bn in January. In
February last year the societies lent Pounds 1.3bn in net advances.
The month is usually the slowest in the year for the housing finance
industry, but the association figures suggest that there were also some
signs of a modest revival in lending activity by the societies in February.
The volume of new loans - those pledged by societies but not yet completed -
rose to Pounds 2.70bn from Pounds 2.26bn in January. That follows a
half-percentage-point cut in the prevailing building society mortgage
interest rate in January.
The association believes, however, that the February figures come too soon
for the effects of the cut to show through in the lending figures.
Societies also fared badly on their savings business. The net monthly inflow
of savings fell from Pounds 293m in January to Pounds 145m last month.
