FT  13 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU key to Ukraine's independence


   From Mr VIACHESLAV SKRYGHIN


Sir, We wholeheartedly support Ian Davidson's call ('Russia policy is
vital', March 30) for a comprehensive and definitive policy on the part of
the European Union towards extending its sphere of influence eastwards.
While Davidson acknowledges, but excludes, territories of the former Soviet
Union in his argument for expanding EU influence in central and eastern
Europe, we in Ukraine foresee the impact such influence might have on our
own development and we encourage its growth.
Ukraine, currently seeking to define its political identity, has been
straddling a course between east and west. While we cannot deny that
Russia's influence will predominate for some time, those of us who encourage
a western orientation to Ukraine's future understand that extending EU
influence to our borders will help propel Ukraine toward true independence
from its eastern neighbour.
Therefore, EU expansion to the east will help balance possible Russian
aggression in Ukraine's political and economic development and Ukrainian
acquiescence to its powerful force.
We understand the geopolitical difficulties and complexities currently faced
by both the EU and the US in formulating a policy towards Russia and its
former republics which meets western interests without antagonising a still
powerful political giant.
Nevertheless, we cannot help but believe that the integration of the Soviet
Union's former satellites into the EU is the first step towards ensuring
Ukraine's independent future.
