FT  22 JUL 94 / Wellcome forecasts further double-digit growth


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reported a 12 per cent
advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 182m for the four months to June 30.
Sales increased 13 per cent from Pounds 610m to Pounds 690m, but were
flattered by the inclusion for the first time of revenues from the Warner
Wellcome Consumer Healthcare joint venture. Underlying sales growth of
prescription products was 7 per cent, reaching Pounds 558m.
Mr John Robb, chairman and chief executive, said margins had been maintained
and he expected double-digit growth to continue this year. Margins would
remain in the 28 to 32 per cent range.
Wellcome surprised analysts with a larger than expected Pounds 52m
exceptional charge to restructure its consumer operations. Mr Robb said
there would be no further exceptional items related to the Warner Wellcome
venture. The shares fell 10p to 605p.
Zovirax, the anti-herpes compound and Wellcome's top-selling drug, generated
sales of Pounds 270m, up 17 per cent. US sales increased 27 per cent to
Pounds 106m, which Mr Robb described as a tremendous achievement. Only 3
percentage points of growth had been achieved through price increases.
Zovirax sales in Europe were up 9 per cent at Pounds 90m, but suffered price
cuts equivalent to three percentage points. Japanese sales were up only 4
per cent at Pounds 55m, because of doctors' fears of prescribing anti-viral
medicines after a competitor's product killed a number of patients. Sales
there were now recovering, said Mr Robb.
Sales of Retrovir, the HIV and Aids treatment also known as AZT, fell 15 per
cent to Pounds 62m. The drug is still struggling with the Anglo-French
Concorde trial published last year which questioned its effectiveness in
patients who were HIV-positive but without symptoms.
Mr Robb said he was not overly concerned about the US Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee's delay in considering Zovirax as a
non-prescription drug.
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 12.7p. The second interim dividend
per share was 5.8p.
The company was reporting second interim results as it is changing its
financial year-end from August to December.
