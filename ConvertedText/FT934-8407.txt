FT  16 NOV 93 / Scots islands gain top school grades


   By JAMES BUXTON


SCHOOLS IN Shetland and Orkney continue to achieve the highest percentages
of top grades in the main examinations for 16-year-olds in Scottish schools,
official exam results published by the Scottish Office yesterday show.
The results, which cover the past three years, give detailed figures on the
results for all Scottish secondary schools.
They cover 'standard grade' examinations and 'highers', which are normally
taken one year after standard grade and are the main examination for
university entrants.
While Shetland and Orkney, as well as Western Isles and Borders region,
emerge well from the tables in terms of the percentage of pupils getting top
grades, Strathclyde and Lothian, the two largest regions in Scotland, come
at the bottom.
