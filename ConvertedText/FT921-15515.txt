TANDEM Computers, the California-based computer manufacturer, expects to
report an operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1992, which has
just ended.
It also said it would take a Dollars 90m restructuring charge, consolidate
its operations and cut about 700 jobs.
Tandem's stock price rose to Dollars 13, from a Tuesday close of Dollars 11
5/8 , on news of the restructuring.
The company said it expected to achieve savings of Dollars 40m to Dollars
50m in the current fiscal year ending in September, and Dollars 90m to
Dollars 100m in fiscal 1993.
Among the restructuring plans to be implemented over the next nine months
are consolidation of some offices and facilities, write-offs of
non-productive assets and redundancies.
Tandem has reduced its workforce by 3 per cent over the past six months, and
plans an additional 6 per cent cut.
The computer company said it expected first-quarter revenues to be slightly
above last year's level of Dollars 444m.
For fiscal 1991, Tandem reported a sharp decline in earnings to Dollars
35.2m, or 33 cents a share, compared with net income in fiscal 1990 of
Dollars 121.8m, or Dollars 1.13. Revenues for 1991 were Dollars 1.92bn, up
from Dollars 1.87bn the previous year.
'We believe the economic framework of the computer industry is changing,'
said Mr James Treybig, Tandem president and chief executive.
He said the restructuring was needed to maintain the company's position as a
low-cost producer of fault-tolerant, on-line transaction processing systems.
Tandem is a large supplier of computer systems to banks, airlines and other
businesses which frequently access critical business data.
'The economic environment continues to be very tough and we do not
anticipate relief in the short term, but the path we have embarked on today
will make us more operationally efficient,' said Mr Treybig.
Compaq Computer said that worldwide orders for its portable 486c personal
computer had exceeded company expectations, AP-DJ reports.
The company said it last month began shipping its first colour transportable
PC to customers worldwide.
