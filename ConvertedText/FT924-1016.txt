FT  21 DEC 92 / Brazil announces push for growth


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   RIO DE JANEIRO


THE Brazilian government has decided to give a return to growth priority
over combating inflation, in a clear policy shift announced after a two-day
ministerial meeting.
The meeting, called to settle on an economic policy and end instability,
firmly ruled out the idea of an economic shock plan widely rumoured since
last week's suspension of the privatisation programme and resignation of the
economy minister.
The ministers agreed a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) government works programme
to stimulate production and employment, and a gradual lowering of interest
rates.
'Under this government the population will not wake up one morning to find
everything has been changed by some arbritary act,' stressed Mr Paulo
Haddad, the planning minister. 'There will be no economic shocks or measures
such as incomes and prices policy, price freezes, dollarisation or
confiscation of savings.'
Mr Haddad emerged strengthened from the meeting, having persuaded President
Itamar Franco against a sharp cut in interest rates. He is also expected to
take on the economy portfolio.
The discussions contrasted starkly with those of the previous administration
of President Fernando Collor which concentrated on privatisation and lifting
trade barriers. Instead the Franco government is focusing on state
intervention to build up the internal market and alleviate social problems.
As a first step the government will invest Cr44,200bn (Pounds 2.6bn) in road
and house building projects next year with the aim of creating 1m jobs. It
was not clear where the money would come from, as the budget deficit for
next year is already more than Dollars 13bn.
The government is also introducing differentiated public sector tariffs,
keeping down prices for low users of gas, electricity, postage and
telephones.
