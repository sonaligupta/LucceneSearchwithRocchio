   WELLINGTON


Wrightson, New Zealand's biggest rural supply company, reported after-tax
profit of NZDollars 8m (USDollars 3m), 10 per cent higher than predicted at
its flotation in December, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
Wrightson was formerly a subsidiary of Fletcher Challenge. It was sold to
Fletcher Challenge shareholders as part of the parent company's asset
reduction programme.
