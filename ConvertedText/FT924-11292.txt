FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Row over Gatt talks 'signal'


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


HEADS of Mr Bill Clinton's campaign for the US presidency yesterday were
investigating reports that a lawyer, claiming to be a campaign official, had
sent a signal to the EC to delay a Uruguay Round trade agreement until after
the November 3 election.
Campaign officials strongly denied charges made by President Bush on Sunday
that one of their team may have made a deal with the French to sabotage the
current talks centring on farm trade reform.
Throughout the US election campaign, Mr Clinton's spokesmen have been
universally discreet regarding the Democratic candidate's intentions on
trade. Beyond warning that Mr Clinton will not necessarily concur with
anything the Bush administration negotiates, it has steadfastly stuck to one
line: there is one president and he must do the negotiating.
A spokesman for the European Community in Washington said that 'someone'
claiming to have 'solid links' with the Clinton campaign had met EC
ambassador Andreas Van Agt to discuss various options for a Gatt settlement.
The delegation did not check the person's credentials and the ambassador
ended up sending a cable to Brussels with a long political analysis based on
the conversation.
However, the spokesman said, 'the whole story has been much exaggerated. We
always send political analyses to Brussels.'
