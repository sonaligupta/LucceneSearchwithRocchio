FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: Microsoft lifted 24% by buoyant
PC area

   SAN FRANCISCO


Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, announced strong
growth in sales and earnings for its fourth quarter. The results were
boosted by a surge in sales of personal computer operating systems programs.
On Saturday, Microsoft settled anti-trust complaints by reaching an
agreement with the US Justice Department and European competition
authorities to modify the terms on which it sells operating system licences
to PC makers.
It said the settlement would have no material impact on earnings.
Second-quarter revenues were Dollars 1.29bn, up 24 per cent over the Dollars
1.04bn for the same period in 1993. Net income was Dollars 362m, or 59 cents
a share (restated to reflect the company's two-for-one stock split in May),
compared with Dollars 265m, or 43 cents.
Income includes a Dollars 30m reversal of part of a third-quarter Dollars
120m charge, relating to a Los Angeles court order that Microsoft pay
damages to Stac Electronics for patent infringement. Last month, Microsoft
reached a settlement agreement with Stac. Net income for the fourth quarter
would have been Dollars 342m, or 56 cents, without the gain.
For the year, revenues were Dollars 4.65bn, up 24 per cent from Dollars
3.75bn in fiscal 1993. Net income rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.15bn from
Dollars 953m. Earnings per share were Dollars 1.88, compared with Dollars
1.57 last year after the stock split.
Excluding the litigation charge and the settlement, net income for the year
was Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.98.
'We've completed our 19th consecutive year of revenue and earnings growth,'
said Mr Mike Brown, vice-president of finance.
Microsoft's sales of operating systems programs to PC manufacturers reached
an all-time high, up 61 per cent over the preceding 12 months. Sales of
Windows, the widely used PC operating system, were particularly strong.
