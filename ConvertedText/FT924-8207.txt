FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: St James's Place net assets up


   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor


NET ASSETS per share at St James's Place Capital, the investment company
chaired by Lord Rothschild, rose by 5.4 per cent to 100.7p in the six months
to September 30.
The directors take the view that the company should be judged on a net asset
basis, rather than on the profit and loss account. Pre-tax profits fell to
Pounds 3.7m, against Pounds 21.6m.
The company was formed after the demerger of J Rothschild Holdings. It
operates a fund management arm and has interests in J Rothschild Assurance,
a life company, J Rothschild, Wolfensohn, a corporate finance business and a
stake in RIT Capital Partners.
The increased value of the stake in RIT was the main factor behind the
increase in net asset value over the period.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p .
RIT Capital Partners, the investment trust, reported a fully diluted net
asset value of 146.1p per share at September 30, a 3.8 per cent rise on the
year-end figure of 140.7p. Net asset value at end-September 1991 was 136.6p
per share.
RIT's biggest investment, representing 31 per cent of its net assets, is a
stake in Newmont Mining, included at 75 per cent of the market price on the
NYSE to reflect the lack of liquidity of a large block of shares - the
holding is 7 per cent of Newmont's equity.
Earnings per share were shown as 0.36p (1.58p). The shares fell 3p to 109p.
