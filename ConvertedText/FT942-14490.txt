FT  20 APR 94 / Observer: Strategic Betting


Mike Bett, former deputy chairman of BT and current president of the
Institute of Personnel Management, has just taken on one of the most
delicate missions of his career; he is to head the UK government's review
body into military pay and conditions.
He's been on duty for less than a month but a few clues to his campaign can
already be gleaned from the latest issue of Personnel Management Plus
magazine. It could turn out to be explosive stuff.
'If the civilian organisations are developing flatter structures with fewer
layers, perhaps we should be asking whether the same should be happening in
the forces,' he says in the magazine. What does that mean - farewell to
captains, colonels and the officers' mess? Bett refuses to put his head
above the parapet on that one.
More intriguingly, Bett has also been put in charge of looking at
performance-related pay for the armed forces. So let's welcome the new model
army: bonuses rather than medals for especial valour; extra cash for
particularly smart saluting; an army marching on its share options;
empowered lions; redundant donkeys.
'I'm only 18 days into the thing . . .,' says Bett, who insists that he's
only following orders, in his case the terms of reference of the review.
If you thought Sir Patrick Sheehy's report on police pay and conditions was
controversial, wait for this one.
