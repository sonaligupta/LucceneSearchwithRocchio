FT  30 OCT 93 / How To Spend It: A catalogue of charitable ideas - Lucia van
der Post explains how to help a good cause and give pleasure to your friends


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


CHRISTMAS is coming . . . and the catalogues are getting fat. For all those
who believe in planning and plotting it is time to sit down with pen and
pencil and send off for the catalogues of your choice.
For those who prefer to spend their hard-earned pounds where they believe
they will do the greatest good, here is a list of some of the best-known and
most deserving charities that you could support this Christmas:
Notting Hill Housing Trust, 26 Paddenswick Road, London W6 OUB. Tel:
081-563-5000. Catalogue free or available from any of the 13 trust shops.
A charity that aims to help house those most in need. Although it manages
some 10,000 homes, there are still about 37,000 homeless families in London.
The catalogue is very small - useful for those who do not like being
confronted with too much choice - well-edited and offers a few really
attractive presents at good prices. Camel candlesticks, 40cm high (sketched
here) are Pounds 7.99 each and there is an equally attractive elephant and
fish version.
There is a charming pure white cotton night dress, (Pounds 21.99), cotton
lace cushions covers at Pounds 7.99 and pillowcases at Pounds 10.99.
Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Freepost, PO Box 48, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14
1BR. Tel: 0283-512040 for a free catalogue.
Many people's favourite charity, here supporters can buy most of their
Christmas essentials - from crackers (much better designed this year) to
cards, papers (look out for a particularly chic black and gold design),
ribbon and decorations to plum pudding and fruit cake.
When it comes to presents there is nothing very beautiful but quite a lot
that is useful - a wooden indoor croquet set (Pounds 34.95) would be handy
for the country-house set, fleecy-lined slippers (Pounds 12.99) useful for
those who live in draughty houses and the AA Guide to Short Walks to Country
Pubs (Pounds 8.99) could inject some fun into the life of ardent
fell-walkers.
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital Fund, PO Box 20 Tanners Lane,
Barkingside, Ilford, Essex 1G6 1QQ. Tel: 0268-288577. Catalogue free.
As many already know, this charity helps towards the treatment and care of
seriously ill children from all over the UK. A small selection of the
Christmas staples - cards, crackers, wrapping paper et al - and an equally
small selection of presents. Choose from a wooden two-piece duck clothes
brush (Pounds 9.95), a set of carpet bowls (Pounds 25.95), mystery games
(Pounds 15.99), key-rings, pens and the like.
Oxfam Trading, Murdock Road, Bicester, Oxon OX6 7RF. Tel: 0869-245011 for a
free catalogue.
Profits from catalogue sales go to help local craftsmen and women in poor
areas of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean. Last year's profits
helped to start marketing initiatives in India, a shop in Thailand, training
in Sri Lanka and Bolivia and a refuse cart in El Salvador. Lots of colourful
ethnic crafts ranging from a brilliantly coloured cotton canvas director's
chair (Pounds 39.95) to a tapestry kit based on Oriental rug designs (Pounds
37.95).
Levels of taste vary so there ought to be something for everybody.
Particularly appealing were the decorative Peruvian mirror (Pounds 25.95),
charming safari mugs 9Pounds 7.95), some wonderfully old-fashioned striped
pure cotton tea-towels from South India (Pounds 5.70), rugs from Kashmir,
Peru and Pakistan, and quite a good selection of toys. There is a separate
catalogue which features its cards, wrapping paper, calendars and diaries -
available from the address above.
NSPCC Trading Company, PO Box 39, Burton-on-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel:0283-510111. Catalogue free.
Big selection of Christmas cards, papers and gift tags, and a useful, if
unexciting, selection of presents - personalised pens, aromatherapy oils,
scented drawer liners and hangers, luggage straps and cassette carriers. A
choice of gadgets for the gizmo fancier - alarm lights, hand-held sewing
machine, lanterns with in-built alarms and so on.
Brainwaves from Childline, Freepost SU 361, Dept 5317, Hendon Road,
Sunderland, SR9 9AD. Tel: 091-514-4666.
Some really splendid presents for children - from jigsaws to a box of
science tricks (Pounds 7.95), lots of models to build, a working camera to
make (Pounds 16.95), bubbles to blow, old-fashioned clay building kits
(Pounds 45) and traditional games to play (Pounds 22.50).
World Wide Fund for Nature, PO Box 49, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel:0283-510344 for free catalogue.
Cards, calendars and wrapping paper, much of it on a furry note, and a wide
range of animal/conservation slanted presents. A tropical rain forest puzzle
(Pounds 9.99), wooden Noah's ark (Pounds 19.99), duvet covers, cushion
covers, t-shirts all embellished with colourful signs of wild-life from a
dolphin to a complete range of jungle life.
British Heart Foundation, Heart Cards, PO Box 45, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14
3LQ. Tel: 0283-512040. Catalogue free.
Some splendid suitably traditional cards, lots of ornaments, ribbons and
decorations, press-out Christmas books, candles and a rather limited
selection of predictable presents as well - personalised pencil sets, name
tapes, pot-pourri, scarves and ties. For a keen cook the stainless steel
fish poacher (Pounds 28.95) makes a handsome present.
Traidcraft Interiors, Kingsway, Gateheads, Tyne & Wear NE11 ONE. Tel:
091-491-0591.
This catalogue may be slightly less useful as a source of Christmas presents
than for finding well-priced attractive things for the house. It is a
welcome change from the other catalogues, many of which clearly buy from the
same sources, this catalogue has an original, fresh selection of very
attractive things.
Apart from more substantial household objects such as chests and rugs,
wooden cabinets (a charming verdigris finished version for Pounds 44.95) and
chairs, there is a charming selection of appliqued Indian bedspreads (most
children would love the elephant one, Pounds 34.95), a delightful stuffed
fabric doll from Thailand (Pounds 14.95). There are colourful mirrors
(painted glass frames as well as carved wooden ones), a beautiful
hand-painted ceramic bowl (Pounds 36.95) and some wonderfully ethnic coconut
shell salad servers (Pounds 4.95).
Lifewatch, Freepost, SU361, Hendon Road, Sunderland, SR9 9AD. Tel:
091-5142777 for a free catalogue.
The usual collection of sweat-shirts, t-shirts, calendars and notebooks all
on a wild-life theme. Some particularly horrible gorilla feet slippers which
I guess children would adore (Pounds 7.50), some almost as gruesome wind-up
creepy-crawlies (Pounds 9.95 each), silver-plated elephant cuff-links
(Pounds 17.50), a fine owl needlework kit cushion cover and a highly
attractive 1,000 piece 'Happy Animals' jigsaw which should keep the family
occupied during the holiday period.
One or two really rather beautiful things as well - look out for a strong
and simple pewter brooch of penguins (Pounds 8.95) and Malcolm Sutcliffe's
mouth-blown lead crystal glass bowl. For the lazy there is the large mystery
parcel (Pounds 49.95 for at least 10 different items) or a small one (Pounds
24.95 for at least five mystery items) - they come wrapped in splendidly
old-fashioned plain brown paper and string.
NSF (National Schizophrenia Fellowship), 28 Castle Street,
Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, KTI ISS. Tel: 081-547-3937.
A slim little catalogue from a charity fighting for its share of the
financial limelight. Cards and calendars are mostly what it purveys but some
white, silver and gold crackers at Pounds 12.50 per box seem generously
filled (address books, sewing kits, mini torches etc) and elegantly
contrived.
Queen Elizabeth's Foundation for Disabled People, Leatherhead Court,
Leatherhead, Surrey, KT22 OBN. Tel:0372-842204.
Another slim catalogue with a selection of cards, papers and crackers for
those who want to support this charity and a small selection of rather
predictable presents (sewing kits, photograph albums, pens and Biros,
eau-de-cologne, boxed bridge sets and the like.
Greater London Fund for the Blind, PO Box 81, Burton-upon-Trent, DE14 3LQ.
Tel: 0283-510111.
Cards, paper, ribbons, calendars and decorations and a small selection of
presents. Slippers seem popular this year (anticipating the VAT on fuel?) so
here we have some cosy-looking suede moccasins for just Pounds 10.99 a pair.
Aromatherapy, too, is in - choose from jasmine, camomile, peppermint and
juniper foaming baths or a gift boxed set of four bath oils, Pounds 8.99.
There is a lambswool scarf with tartan pockets (Pounds 24.95), lots of
personalised pens and pencils and what the compilers of the catalogue call
the 'World's Most Difficult Jigsaw' - 529 pieces for Pounds 9.99.
Marie Curie Cancer Care, PO Box 72, Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, DE14
3LQ. Tel:0283-512040.
For those who want to support one of the smaller cancer charities Marie
Curie Cancer Care provides nurses to look after patients at home as well as
funding 11 centres where cancer patients can be looked after around the
clock.
The catalogue offers a familiar collection of cards, wrapping paper,
calendars and crackers as well as some traditional Christmas foods and some
straightforwardly useful presents - woollen scarves, socks, pot-pourri,
gardening gloves, bath oils and a really rather charming matt black wooden
key rack based on the theme of cats, Pounds 5.99.
Shelter Trading Ltd., 88 Old Street, London EC1V 9HU. Tel:071-253-0202.
Nicely produced but very small little catalogue from the charity that helps
with the homeless and badly-housed. Most useful on the Christmas card front
as it offers an exceptionally jolly selection for those who prefer modern
versions of the well-worn themes. A very few presents on offer as well -
beeswax candles, some unexceptional blue and white pottery and some sweet
little wooden puzzles for children.
Christian Aid , PO Box 100, London SE1 7RT. Tel:071-620-4444.
Another catalogue mainly useful for its charming selection of original
Christmas cards - on the present front there is only a selection of
t-shirts, a couple of books and a dairy.
Unicef, 55 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3NB. Tel: 071-405-5592.
Probably the best and biggest selection of Christmas cards - from arty
photographic essays to jolly Nepalese pop-up cards - as well as a small
selection of presents.
STILL on a charitable theme, there are two Christmas fairs that readers like
to make a point of visiting. The Birthright Christmas Fair (Birthright, is a
charity primarily concerned with problems of infertility and the welfare of
newborn babies and their mothers) will be held at the Royal College of
Obstetricians & Gynaecologists, 27 Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London NW1
4SP on Tuesday from 10am to 5pm. Tickets are Pounds 5 each. There is also an
evening preview on Monday November, from 6pm to 9pm for which tickets are
Pounds 10 each. Tickets can be bought at the door.
The Macmillan Fund, a cancer charity, holds its Christmas fair on Thursday
November 11 at the Royal Horticultural Society's New Hall, Vincent Square,
London SW1, from 10am to 5.30pm. Tickets cost Pounds 3 and are available at
the door.
