FT  28 SEP 94 / Sharp fall in recorded crime


   By ALAN PIKE


Figures showing the biggest fall in recorded crime for 40 years rekindled
political disagreement over law and order policies yesterday, Alan Pike
writes.
Crime recorded by police forces in England and Wales fell 5.5 per cent in
the year to June. A total of 5,365,400 offences were recorded in the
previous 12 months, a fall of 311,500 from last year's figures.
Mr David Maclean, home office minister, said the figures showed that rising
crime was not inevitable. The figures were welcome, but the government would
maintain its fight against crime.
Mr Alun Michael, shadow Home Office minister, accused the government of an
exercise in stage management. He said excessive concentration on the overall
reduction in recorded crime was intended to disguise increases in theft from
the person, violence, robbery and sexual offences.
Mr Alan Beith, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the figures
showed crime prevention activities which Mr Michael Howard, home secretary,
failed to back were bringing results.
Results from the most recent British Crime Survey, also published yesterday,
suggest that the proportion of crimes reported is falling.
The anti-terrorism measures operated by the City of London Police achieved
the spin-off of the biggest reduction in recorded crime in the country - an
18 per cent fall, almost three times the fall in London as a whole.
