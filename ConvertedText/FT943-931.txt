FT  27 SEP 94 / People: Newton sails into Kingshott's harbour


Sir Wilfred Newton, 65, the former chief executive of London Transport, has
been appointed non-executive chairman of John I. Jacobs, the small
ship-broking and transportation group headed by Michael Kingshott, chairman
of the Sally ferry line.
Kingshott, who reversed his private Sheertrucks vehicle transportation
business into Jacobs a few months ago, wants to develop Jacobs into a
broadly-based shipping, transport and property group.
The company is currently capitalised at less than Pounds 20m but is known to
be interested in bidding for Embassy Property, where Kingshott is deputy
chairman. Last week it agreed to manage the Dartford International ferry
terminal and announced that the terminal's first customer will be Sally
Freight which is launching a two-ship freight service between Dartford and
Vlissingen.
Sir Wilfred (right), who sits on the boards of HSBC Holdings, its subsidiary
Midland Bank, and Sketchley, qualified as an accountant in South Africa and
had a varied career in industry before being appointed chairman of the Mass
Transit Railway Corporation in Hong Kong in 1983.
Kingshott said that he had been keen to recruit a chairman who was not just
a 'mate of mine' and had a good knowledge of the transportation business. He
said he had found Sir Wilfred through his merchant bank (Hambros) and his
own personal network.
Kingshott, the biggest single shareholder in John I Jacobs, intends to
rename the company and appoint more non-executives to his board. Earlier
this month, Paul Pascan, Sally Line's financial controller, was appointed a
non-executive director.
