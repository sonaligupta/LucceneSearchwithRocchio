FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Pentium PC sales strong despite
flaw, says Intel

Sales of personal computers based on Intel's flawed Pentium microprocessor
chip continued to be robust, in spite of negative publicity and the decision
by IBM to halt sales, US retailers said.
Although customers are asking questions about the chip flaw, they continued
to purchase Pentium PCs in rising numbers, Intel said. 'We have talked to
the leading retailers and they are reporting no slowdown in sales.'
In spite of floods of calls to PC manufacturers and Intel's 'hot lines',
there have been no further reports of PC users being directly hit by the
flaw.
'We've sold more Pentium-based PCs than any company in the US market, and .
. . we had not received one call from a customer complaining of any errors
related to a flaw,' said Mr Ted Waitt, chairman and chief executive of
Gateway 2000, a leading mail order PC supplier.
'If this had been a problem with real world applications, we would have
heard from our customers.'
Several leading PC manufacturers said they would continue to sell Pentium
PCs, in spite of IBM's contention that the flaw can cause frequent errors in
mathematical calculations used in spreadsheet and similar applications.
Microsoft and Lotus Development, two of the leading suppliers of spreadsheet
programs, said they would provide customers with a software 'patch' that
avoids use of the flawed portion of the Pentium chips.
Microsoft said it believed customers could continue to use and purchase
Pentium-based PCs with confidence. 'Microsoft is continuing to purchase new
Pentium systems for its own use,' it said.
Other PC manufacturers expressing continued confidence in the Pentium chip
include Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Packard Bell, Tandy, Advanced Logic Research
and Acer.
