FT  26 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


BBC2 shows the first episode in a series for which filming began eight years
ago: Doctors To Be. In 1984 2,000 people applied to St Mary's, London, to
train as doctors; 400 were offered interviews, and 100 given places.
The series is concerned with the processes of selection and training and,
thanks to its long lead-time, is able to follow the process all the way
through. Those seen being chosen for training in today's programme are now
working as junior doctors in hospitals across Britain (8.10).
BBC1 launches another comedy series by Marks and Gran, creators of 'Shine On
Harvey Moon' and 'Birds Of A Feather'. Get Back (8.30) is described as 'a
recession comedy' and features two brothers, raised on a London council
estate, who have succeeded in the retail trade.
C4's current affairs programme Cutting Edge (9.00) begins a fresh run with
an account of a 'psychiatric flying squad' in Barnet which responds to calls
from those unable to cope.
That marvellous series The Victorian Kitchen Garden mixing horticulture,
history, technology and so much more, ends its repeat run (11.15 BBC1).
