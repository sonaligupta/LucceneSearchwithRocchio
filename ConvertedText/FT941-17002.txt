FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico and Brazil


Mexican stocks rallied sharply to end the session almost 100 points higher,
driven by widespread perceptions that the government has the uprising in
Chiapas under control. The IPC index, after a late rebound on Tuesday, rose
98.42, or 3.85 per cent, to a record 2,657.31.
Brazilian shares closed 5 per cent ahead but below the day's best after
gains were trimmed by late selling on reports that a powerful faction of the
centrist PMDB, Brazil's largest political party, could withdraw its support
from the government. The Bovespa index ended at 42,105, up 2,100, after
touching 43,565.
