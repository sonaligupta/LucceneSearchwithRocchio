FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Hollas restructuring starts to pay off


   By TIM BURT


Hollas, the Manchester-based clothing and textiles group, yesterday
announced details of its restructuring programme aimed at transforming the
company into a broadly-based garment supplier.
The group, which acquired clothing companies JB Hunter and Textilion in
March following an Pounds 18.3m rights issue, said it was pursuing
'significant opportunities' among both high street retailers and industrial
customers.
The strategy follows the appointment last autumn of Mr Julian Lee as chief
executive, who yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 165,000 for the
year to March 31 against restated losses of Pounds 7.3m.
The 1993 figures were readjusted under FRS 3 to take account of Pounds 7.9m
of goodwill written off on the 1989 acquisition of Hawkshead, the 50 per
cent-owned mail order company.
Mr Lee said the small profit last year was due entirely to contributions by
Gardiner, the clothing import business.
Turnover, however, fell slightly from Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 43.8m and Mr
Lee warned: 'This company would have been dead within three years if it had
remained an importer.'
Operating profits fell from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 756,000, although Mr Lee
said there would have been an increase had the company not made a Pounds
280,000 compensation payment to Mr Tony Lawson, who stepped down as chief
executive to become non-executive chairman.
In other management changes, Mr Roger Wallwork, finance director for more
than 20 years, has been replaced by Mr Paul Baddiley. Mr Jaymin Trivedi has
left the board to concentrate on Gardiner Trading, the group's Hong Kong
associate; and Mr Robert Jackson, a former director at Charterhouse Tilney,
has joined as director responsible for corporate development.
Although losses per share fell from a restated 12.28p to 0.12p, the final
dividend is cut to 0.3p, making 0.6p (1.2p) for the year.
