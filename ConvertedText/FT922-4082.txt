FT  08 JUN 92 / People: Limerick for AMP


AMP, Australia's biggest life insurance company, has put the finishing
touches to its newly-established UK investment business by appointing the
Earl of Limerick as chairman of AMP Asset Management.
AMP Asset Management, which has Pounds 13bn of funds under management, was
set up last November following AMP's 1989 acquisitions of both Pearl
Assurance and London Life. AMP has combined Pearl's investment management
business with that of London Life's, lumping in its own international
investments as well. The new London-based operation is headed by Ray
Greenshields who came over from Australia last year.
Although AMP Asset Management is only managing the funds of its own
companies at present, Greenshields says that it will start offering its
investment skills to outsiders next year. It has recently hired John Whalley
from Norwich Union to look after its Pounds 1.5bn UK property portfolio and
a new marketing director is being recruited. Greenshields said that the new
group, which is heavily retail orientated, plans to expand into the
wholesale market.
In an effort to give the new group its own independent identity, Lord
Limerick, a former deputy chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has been recruited
to a board which includes Tom Hutchison, a former ICI executive, and John
Sadler, a former finance director of the John Lewis Partnership.
Lord Limerick, 62, who retired from the Kleinwort Benson Group in May 1990,
is chairman of Pirelli UK and a non-executive director of De La Rue.
