FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Groupe Schneider sees benefits
of lower debt

Groupe Schneider, the French electrical engineering and construction group,
raised net profits by 33 per cent to FFr405m (Dollars 69.46m) last year as
lower debts reduced financial charges and operating margins resisted
Europe's recession.
The group, which was last year merged with SPEP, the holding company which
is Schneider's principal shareholder, also expressed optimism about 1994.
'The activity of the group should benefit from the gradual improvement in
the European economy, from a clearer recovery in the US and from continued
growth in Asia,' the company said.
Last year's result was achieved on a decline in turnover from FFr59.66bn to
FFr56.38bn. Most of the fall came from the Enterprise arm, which includes
the three main activities of the loss-making Spie Batignolles division.
Losses at Spie Batignolles were reduced last year, from FFr275m in 1992 to
FFr215m, reflecting the impact of cost-cutting measures introduced in 1992.
Improvement was limited, however, by slower than anticipated sales of real
estate.
According to Schneider, the principal factors behind the rise in profits
were the reduction in debt and the resilience of profit margins. Net debts
were reduced by about 40 per cent to FFr10.9bn at the end of the year,
following the sale of non-strategic assets worth about FFr2bn.
