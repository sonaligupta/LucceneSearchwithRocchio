FT  01 JUL 92 / Initiative to reduce local red tape


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE government launched an initiative yesterday to reduce the amount of red
tape businesses encounter in their dealings with local authorities.
Nine councils will establish partnerships with local business groups to draw
up guidelines to help businesses conform with regulations, under a pilot
programme announced by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry.
Small businesses in particular frequently have difficulty in complying with
a range of regulations covering such areas as trading standards,
environmental health, social services, planning, building control and fire
safety.
The local authorities taking part in the project will set up consultation
groups with businesses to discuss issues and to draw up a range of booklets
explaining the regulations.
The booklets will set out the authorities' regulatory responsibilities,
explain what information is available and where it can be found, and state
the authorities' policy objectives and their enforcement procedures.
They will lay down performance standards that businesses can expect from the
authority on, for example, the response time to inquiries, and explain how
businesses can complain or appeal against a decision. The booklets are due
to be published at the end of this year or early next year.
A small team at the department will help the local authorities to spread
best practice throughout the group. Business representatives will monitor
the progress of the initiative.
The authorities represent a cross-section of metropolitan and rural areas,
large and small councils and different political hues. They comprise county
and borough councils from Kent, Tunbridge Wells, Suffolk, Ipswich,
Nottinghamshire, Gedling, Barnsley, Hounslow and South Ribble.
