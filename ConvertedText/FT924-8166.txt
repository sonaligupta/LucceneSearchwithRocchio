FT  12 NOV 92 / Manchester gets green summit


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


NEXT YEAR'S world environment summit will be in Manchester in September to
tackle implementation of plans agreed at this year's summit in Rio de
Janeiro. It will probably be attended by many heads of government.
Britain offered to host the summit after Mr John Major's visit to Rio.
Manchester beat rival bids from London, Edinburgh, Brighton, Reading and
Norwich.
The timing of the summit could help Manchester's bid to stage the 2000
Olympic games. The International Olympic Committee will meet in September,
when it will have to choose between the main contenders of Manchester,
Berlin, Beijing and Sydney.
Summit supporters include Central Manchester Development Corporation, the
British Council - a government agency - Manchester Metropolitan University,
the United Nations Association, Manchester Airport, the north-west business
leadership team and Granada Television.
The summit will be run by the government, with a core conference of about
500 delegates, but about 2,000 people are expected for two weeks of
environment-related fringe events.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, said the city would
use the summit to stress the green elements of its bid for the 2000 Olympic
games. Urban regeneration is one of the criteria the International Olympic
Committee will use.
Land reclamation, clean technology policies, tree planting and recycling of
waste materials are all part of the city's attempt to impress IOC delegates.
