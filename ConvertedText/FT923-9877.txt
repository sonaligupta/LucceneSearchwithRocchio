FT  03 AUG 92 / Capital keeps grip on HQs


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


LONDON'S dominant position in corporate and financial Britain continues
according to new research, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. That is in spite of
growth in professional services to keep more company headquarters near large
regional cities.
The figures have been compiled by Mr John Dyson, corporate services director
of BWD Securities, the Huddersfield-based stockbroking and financial and
professional services group. Mr Dyson produces BWD's quarterly review of
mainly northern companies, which he has been extending to give a broader
picture of quoted corporate life in the regions.
The picture drawn by his analysis of Britain's corporate structure outside
the south-east is of sizeable clusters of medium-sized quoted companies in
the west Midlands, the Yorkshire and Humberside area and north-west England,
but a thinning out to the north and the west, where the companies are also
smaller.
However, smaller numbers can produce local distortions. In the east
Midlands, for example, the average quoted company is worth Pounds 179m, but
Mr Dyson says that is distorted by Boots in Nottingham, which alone accounts
for 40 per cent of the aggregate value of the 63 quoted companies in the
region.
Mr Dyson said: 'It is possible there may be some change in the balance of
companies between London and the rest of the UK during the 1990s, but there
is thus far only limited evidence for it.'
