FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): The view from abroad


Now the UK is a member of the European exchange rate mechanism, will its
stock markets follow the continental lead?. The graphs show just how much
the markets of the other members have tended to track each other once their
exchange rate parities are established.
Neither the Milan nor the Frankfurt market has managed yet to regain the
heights reached before the Gulf War. Both have been almost locked together.
But they showed very different responses to elections which took place in
both countries on Sunday.
Stocks on the Milan market dropped following the Italian general election
results, which saw the fall of the Christian Democrat-led coalition
government. As the UK markets had demonstrated over the last few weeks,
there is nothing dealers like less than uncertainty, and there is plenty of
it about in Italy.
Meanwhile, Frankfurt traders were unmoved by the swing to the hard right in
two state elections, potentially destabilising, and the DAX moved up on the
strength of stronger bond futures and promising economic news.
