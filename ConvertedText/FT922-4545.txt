FT  05 JUN 92 / Marcos friend claims war loot built fortune


   By JOSE GALANG


   MANILA


MR ENRIQUE ZOBEL, a Manila businessman who was a confidant of the late
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, claimed yesterday that the dictator
had gold deposits abroad worth more than Dollars 35bn (Pounds 19.4bn) - much
of it Second World War loot obtained from a Japanese general.
Mr Zobel, one of the most respected businessmen in the country, said in a
television interview that Mr Marcos, before he died in exile in Hawaii in
September 1989, was working on a trust fund that would assume control of the
gold deposits and 'retire the country's foreign debt'.
'I saw the actual certificates of gold bullion deposits. All those documents
that were shown to me are now in Bong-bong's possession,' Mr Zobel said,
using the nickname of Mr Marcos's son, Ferdinand Jr.
Mr Zobel said that besides the Dollars 3bn worth of gold deposits now frozen
in Switzerland, Mr Marcos had other gold deposits elsewhere in the world. In
all, these deposits were estimated by Mr Zobel to be worth Dollars 35bn.
Previous estimates of the Marcos wealth have been about Dollars 10bn. He
claimed the gold had come mainly from the wartime loot of General Tomoyuki
Yamashita, who is known to have died in the northern Philippines.
During the Marcos years, Mr Zobel was head of the property-based
conglomerate, Ayala Corporation.
