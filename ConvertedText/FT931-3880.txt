FT  13 MAR 93 / Official figures show oil and gas sectors excluded from
falling output


OUTPUT in every sector of the UK economy, excluding oil and gas extraction,
was flat or falling in the final quarter of last year according to official
figures released yesterday.
Revised data from the Central Statistical Office confirm that gross domestic
product rose by 0.2 per cent in the last three months of 1992 compared with
the previous quarter. This left GDP up 0.1 per cent on the same quarter a
year earlier.
GDP excluding oil was flat quarter-on-quarter compared with a provisional
0.1 per cent fall. It was 0.1 per cent lower than a year before.
Many analysts are confident that the revised figures are consistent with an
economic turning point. Mr Kevin Gardiner of SG Warburg said he now expected
to see forecasts for growth this year nudge upwards.
According to Consensus Economics, a consultancy, the latest mean forecast
for growth this year among City economists is 1.1 per cent. This compares
with the Treasury's forecast of 1 per cent, and last month's consensus of 1
per cent.
The figures also confirmed that domestic demand fell by 0.3 per cent in the
final quarter compared with the previous quarter after five successive
quarterly gains.
The drop in domestic demand reflected a sharp increase in the rate of
destocking. Inventories fell by Pounds 711m in the fourth quarter after
falls of Pounds 495m and Pounds 299m in the second and third quarters
respectively.
