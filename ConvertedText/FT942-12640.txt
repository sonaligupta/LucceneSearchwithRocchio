FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Xerox starts off year with 5%
improvement


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


Xerox, the US document processing company, reported a 5 per cent increase in
first-quarter net profits from Dollars 125m a year ago to Dollars 131m on
its core operations. It said the increase would have been 21 per cent
without the effect of a Dollars 17m tax credit in last year's first quarter.
However, fully diluted earnings per share on the document processing
business fell from Dollars 1.08 to Dollars 1.04 because of a 10 per cent
increase in issued equity following last June's stock offering.
Total group net income fell from Dollars 189m to Dollars 129m, but Xerox
said this comparison was not meaningful because last year's figures included
Dollars 77m from discontinued operations - mainly a Dollars 62m gain on the
sale of Van Kampen Merritt, an asset management company.
Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive, said the increased income
from document processing was due to productivity improvements and strong
growth in equipment sales.
The world-wide document processing workforce declined by 4,200 in the first
quarter in line with company's restructuring plan announced in December.
Document processing revenues rose 1 per cent to Dollars 3.27bn - the rise
would have been 5 per cent without the effect of exchange rate fluctuations.
Revenues from digital products grew 21 per cent net of currency effects, and
now represented 19 per cent of revenues.
Inflation in Brazil meant foreign currency losses shot up from Dollars 23m
to Dollars 61m.
