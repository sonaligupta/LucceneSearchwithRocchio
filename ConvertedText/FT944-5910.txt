FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: Wrong ring


Cellnet's new guide to European business etiquette - Euromanners - promises
to help the Brit conducting business abroad '(avoid) any embarrassing social
or business gaffes'. Not before time.
Only trouble is, Cellnet itself would seem to be more urgently in need of
help than even the average clueless Brit. Take the little paragraph on how
women should dress, entitled 'view from a broad'. Or the entry on
accessories, which triumphantly reminds readers that handbags for men are
'widely known in the UK as 'pansy pouches' '.
Which casts doubt, to say the least, on the validity of any of the rest of
the 'advice' on offer.
