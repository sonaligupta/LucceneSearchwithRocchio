FT  27 JUN 92 / India's reforms win aid support


   By DAVID HOUSEGO


   PARIS


Western donor nations yesterday demonstrated their support for India's
economic reform programme by increasing multilateral and bilateral
assistance this year by 7 per cent in nominal terms to Dollars 7.2bn, writes
David Housego in Paris.
Donor nations, gathering in Paris for the Aid India consortium, intended
that their pledges for 1992-93 should be seen by the Indian government as
reflecting a need for more rapid restructuring.
Mr Montek Ahluwalia, secretary for economic affairs and head of the Indian
delegation, acknowledged this in saying that the government would take
'further steps to deepen and intensify the process of structural reform in
the next year or so'.
