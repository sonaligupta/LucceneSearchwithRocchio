FT  18 APR 94 / Intimidation found ahead of Malawi election

Serious anomalies in the run-up to Malawi's elections on May 17 are noted in
a report published today by a UN Joint International Observer Group,
reinforcing earlier findings of the national Electoral Commission.
Both bodies report intimidation, violence, bribery and theft or confiscation
of voters' registration cards. The ruling Malawi Congress party emerges as
the main culprit, but some opposition parties are also said to be engaged in
turf wars and violent disruption of opponents' rallies.
The UN report suggests that government ministers have used the civil service
apparatus for campaigning purposes, and note that one MP registered himself
and his family at two separate centres.
Concern is also expressed about police Inspector General MacWilliam
Lunguzi's assertion that policemen are not allowed to engage in politics,
and therefore may not vote. The UN observers see this as a contravention of
the electoral law and the Electoral Commission is threatening to prosecute
him.
The Electoral Commission estimates that 80 per cent of those eligible to
register have done so. This figure is described as 'respectable' by the UN
group, which does not consider the abuses it has found to be an insuperable
barrier to free elections.
