FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Usher-Walker raises Pounds 6m for purchases


Usher-Walker is paying a total of Pounds 4.7m cash for two printing industry
supplies companies and raising about Pounds 6m through a placing and open
offer.
The printing inks group also warned that a write-off following the
reassessment of stock values, the cost of reorganisations, spending incurred
in its development strategy and a disappointing last quarter would have a
significant impact on its results for 1991.
However, it expects to pay a final dividend of at least 3.75p, unchanged
from the adjusted final last time.
Usher is paying Pounds 3.82m for Hydro Dynamic Products from the
administrative receivers of Stormgard and FFr7.72m (Pounds 789,000) for 90
per cent of Graph Imprim. It is also providing FFr700,000 to acquire the
formulae for products Graph makes and has an option to acquire the other 10
per cent.
HDP reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 819,000 in the year to March 31 1991
at which date it had net tangible assets of Pounds 814,000. In the same
period Graph had pre-tax profits of FFr2.19m and year-end net tangible
assets of FFr2.01m.
A total of 4.38m shares are being placed at 155p and are being offered to
existing shareholders on a 1-for-1 basis. The cash realised will be used for
the acquisitions and to reduce borrowings.
Usher-Walker shares yesterday closed at 165p, down 6p.
