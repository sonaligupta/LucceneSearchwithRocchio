FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Spain offers Algeria Dollars 1bn export
credits


   By FRANCIS GHILES


SPAIN is to extend Dollars 1bn worth of export credits to Algeria in
1992-93. The agreement follows the visit to Algiers last week of Mr Javier
Solana, Spanish foreign minister, the first by an EC foreign minister since
Algeria's electoral process was suspended last January.
Each Dollars 500m package will include two Dollars 150m short-term loans
with maturities of 18 and 24 months, and one medium-term loan. The
short-term moneys will cover Algerian purchases of essential goods, not
least of them food, the other loan will help fund longer-term projects.
Spain's exports to Algeria were worth Dollars 650m last year and are
expected to be slightly higher in 1992. With the building of a new gas
pipeline to Spain, Spanish purchases of Algerian natural gas are set to
treble to about 10bn cubic metres by the late 1990s.
