FT  01 DEC 94 / Observer: Novel idea


A guilty conscience at Great Western? First-class passengers arriving at
Paddington station yesterday were presented with a copy of Degree of Guilt
by Richard North Patterson.
It's all part of a GW promotion, Business First, which gives first class
passengers complimentary refreshments and a daily newspaper between 7 am and
7 pm, Mondays to Fridays. Then, every few weeks, they also get a free book.
The blurb for yesterday's 595-page offering has it as being 'impossible to
put down'. Sounds just right for travelling InterCity.
