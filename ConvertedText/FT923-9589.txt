WESTERN Germany's industrial output in the second quarter of this year was
2.2 per cent lower than in the first three months, the Economics Ministry
reported yesterday.
The ministry, which also revised May production figures from a provisional
increase of 0.7 per cent to a fall of 0.1 per cent, and unveiled a 2.1 per
cent month-on-month drop for June, partly blamed the early start to the
holiday season.
However, the figures revealed the underlying economic slowdown, masked
earlier in the year by the beneficial effects of unusually mild winter
weather on sectors such as construction.
The seasonally-adjusted index of industrial production, which had been
falling gently earlier in the year, fell 2.5 points to 118.7 in June and
stood 5.6 points below the level of June 1991.
A two-month comparison of output in May and June with the same period in
1991 showed a 2.1 per cent drop. Only raw materials and construction showed
any improvement. Output of capital goods fell 3.3 per cent. Consumer
durables were down 3.5 per cent and food and drink output fell 4.5 per cent.
In a similar comparison with March and April of this year industrial
production fell 1.5 per cent.
