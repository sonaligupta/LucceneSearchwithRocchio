FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Club Med in venture with US
cruise line

CLUB Mediterranee, the French holiday group, is joining forces with Carnival
Cruise Lines, the US travel company, to launch a new cruise holiday concept
in Europe and Asia.
The two groups have signed a letter of understanding for their joint
venture, but have yet to finalise the details of the deal, according to Mr
Micky Arison, chairman and chief executive of Carnival.
Club Med and Carnival initially plan to launch a cruise holiday package
combining Carnival's expertise at running cruise ships with Club Med's
experience with holiday villages. The package, which will be launched in the
Mediterranean in summer next year, will be targeted at European clients.
When the venture is established, the two companies will consider launching a
mass-market cruise package for the Asian market. Although the concept of
cruise holidays is already well-established in Europe and Asia, it is not as
popular as in Carnival's home territory, the US.
For Club Med, one of Europe's largest holiday groups, the link with Carnival
is the latest in a number of joint ventures intended to diversify its
interests. Last autumn it joined forces with LTU, the German charter
airlines, to launch an upmarket holiday village business aimed at the German
market.
Club Med is still licking its wounds after a sharp swing into a loss of
FFr17m (Dollars 3.04m) from net profits of FFr395m in its last full
financial year to October 30.
Although the whole international travel industry was disrupted by the Gulf
war last year, Club Med was badly hit because of its concentration in the
south and eastern Mediterranean in Greece, Turkey, Israel and Morocco. It
was also vulnerable because it had expanded its airline interests the
previous year by taking control of Air Liberte and Minerve in France.
