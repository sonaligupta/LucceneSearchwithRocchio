FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Packaging dispute settled


   By ROBERT GIBBENS


THE New Brunswick provincial government has stepped in to solve a dispute
between Stone Container of Chicago and the Canadian Paperworkers Union,
writes Robert Gibbens.
Stone closed its pulp mill at Bathurst, New Brunswick, last autumn because
of poor market conditions and threatened to close the packaging materials
machine alongside if the union did not accept job flexibility and a 20 per
cent cut in the mill's labour costs.
The union agreed to job flexibility and manning reductions, but would not
give way on pay.
The province has provided CDollars 3.5m (USDollars 2.94m) and the union will
put aside CDollars 2m to ease the burden of job losses.
A new contract has been ratified, with pay based on the existing contract
running out next year.
