FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity


Yesterday's announcement by Offer, the electricity regulator, confirmed that
the market in second-hand UK power stations will be a limited affair. The
two generators feared the forced introduction of competitive tendering for
stations marked for closure because that would have encouraged the
persistence of overcapacity. In the event, by merely keeping an option to
appoint independent consultants, Offer seems to have accepted the
probability that there will be few, if any, bidders for plant which the
generators have already written off as uneconomic. The transparency
introduced in the form of individual power plant forecasts scarcely seems
the key to bringing in new entrants either.
All the same, Offer has removed a little of the uncertainty surrounding the
generators in the run-up to the forthcoming deal over future contracts with
British Coal. The timing of that remains obscure, although signs earlier
this week that the regional electricity companies are gradually being
brought into line by the government suggest there may not be much longer to
wait. Whatever the regional companies say publicly, it seems certain that
they will be able to buy electricity more cheaply. The question is by how
much. Until the deal is announced, the generators' shares will doubtless
mark time, not least because they have outperformed the market by nearly 9
per cent in the last month.
