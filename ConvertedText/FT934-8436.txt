FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Mirroring the rise of Pacific nations


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor


ASIA Pacific Economic Co-operation, the grouping holding its annual
ministerial meeting in Seattle this week, was founded four years ago at the
suggestion of Australia.
Its aim is to increase multilateral co-operation in view of the economic
rise of Pacific nations and growing interdependence within the region. The
US was keen to head off any moves to create Asian groupings from which it
would be excluded.
This year, for the first time, leaders of most member states will attend an
informal summit at the invitation of President Bill Clinton after the
ministerial meeting is concluded.
Original Apec members were Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, New
Zealand and the US, together with the six members of the Association of
South-east Asian Nations: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand. Two years ago, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were
admitted simultaneously. Other countries, including Papua New Guinea and
Mexico, are seeking to join.
Chairmanship of Apec is held for a year in rotation. After the Seattle
meeting, the chair will pass to Indonesia.
This year, an Apec secretariat was set up in Singapore with an executive
director whose nationality will also change annually.
Apec also has 10 working groups covering data in investment and trade, trade
promotion, investment and industrial science and technology, human resources
development, energy co-operation, marine resource conservation,
telecommunications, transport, tourism, and fisheries.
