FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Lasers bring home fibre optics
closer


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Fibre-optic networks promise advanced home services such as dial-up films
and high definition 3-D video, as well as futuristic services like consumer
retailing using virtual reality techniques.
The main obstacle to fibre links for home and office has been the high cost
of the optoelectric transmitter modules, units about the size of a postage
stamp which combine a laser and microelectric circuitry.
Bell-Northern Research, the joint venture R&D subsidiary of Canada's
Northern Telecom and Bell Canada groups, has developed a low-cost
semiconductor laser smaller than a grain of salt.
It emits a column of light which makes it easier to connect to optical
fibers and also drastically reduces costs. BNR: Canada, 613 763 5342;
