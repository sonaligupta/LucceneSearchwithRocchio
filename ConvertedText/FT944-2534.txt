FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Nelson's eye


Perfectly understandable if Warburg's Sir David Scholey does not feel like
exchanging Christmas cards with Lazards' vice-chairman John Nelson. Nelson,
one of the City's shrewder merchant bankers, has been making life miserable
for SG Warburg of late. First, he was one of the main reasons why GEC chose
Lazards rather than Warburg in its bid for VSEL, despite the fact that
Scholey is a GEC director.
When there are so few big bids around, it might have helped Warburg impress
Morgan Stanley a bit more if GEC's Lord Weinstock had given it the nod. Now
Warburg's planned get-together with Morgan Stanley has collapsed because
Warburg's Mercury Asset Management subsidiary dug its heels in over the
price. Guess who was advising MAM? Much more of this and Warburg will have
to make a takeover bid for Mr Nelson. Better to have him on the inside etc,
etc.
