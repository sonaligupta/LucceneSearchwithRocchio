FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Bonn to block export for arms


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


   BONN


GERMANY is to open a new Federal exports office, increase customs and
inspection staff, and toughen legal penalties, in an attempt to block
exports of goods which could be used in making weapons, Christopher Parkes
reports from Bonn.
Products which could be used to make or transport weapons will need export
licences from the new office, to open on April 1, the cabinet agreed
yesterday. The list of controlled goods includes machine tools, components
which could be used in rockets or uranium enrichment and civilian plant
which might be 'misused' to make chemical weapons. Licences will not be
issued for such shipments to 'sensitive' countries.
The cabinet agreed Chancellor Helmut Kohl would urge adoption of a uniform
international arms control policy while chairman of the forthcoming western
economic summit in Munich. Breaches of the new German controls or UN
embargoes will be punished by up to 15 years' jail. German technicians
working overseas will be covered by the legislation, an economics ministry
paper presented to the cabinet said.
The paper said Germany must introduce new rules to stop it being used as a
staging post for suspect or illegal shipments from other countries. Other
measures include 100 extra staff at the the customs crime bureau, raising
the workforce there to 370, and a staff of over 400 for examining exports
and issuing licences. About 18m export shipments leave Germany a year.
Peru has introduced a system whereby all imports will be inspected by an
independent company before shipment. Four have been nominated: Cotecna Group
and SGS of Switzerland, Bureau Veritas of France, and SSI, part of the UK
Inchcape group.
