FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: JP Morgan starts year with 20%
fall in income


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


JP Morgan, the New York banking group, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall
in first-quarter net income, due mainly to a sharp drop in revenues from
trading in global financial markets, which turned sour two months ago.
The bank reported net income of Dollars 345m, or Dollars 1.69 a share,
compared with Dollars 432m, or Dollars 2.16, in the same period of last
year, excluding the effect of an accounting change.
The figures were broadly in line with Wall Street expectations of earnings
of Dollars 1.70 a share.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.39bn, compared with Dollars 1.48bn, with net
interest revenue dipping to Dollars 397m from Dollars 432m. Excluding
receipts from Latin American companies restructuring their debt, net
interest revenue was up 5 per cent, which the bank said reflected improved
results from its European and Asian asset and liability management
activities.
Non-interest revenue dipped to Dollars 994m from Dollars 1.051bn. Trading
revenues were Dollars 356m - down 24 per cent on the Dollars 469m reported
in the first quarter of last year and 41 per cent lower than the record
Dollars 606m of 1993's final quarter - as the bank's positioning activities
were affected by difficult market conditions.
However, Morgan said that client-related trading activities had benefited
from strong demand for risk management products, particularly swaps and
other interest rate contracts, and for US fixed-income securities.
Corporate finance revenues totalled Dollars 117m, compared with Dollars
119m. Lower underwriting revenue of Dollars 45m was largely offset by
increased advisory fees.
Credit-related fees were up 4 per cent at Dollars 56m, investment management
fees rose 12 per cent to Dollars 127m, and operational services saw a 24 per
cent increase in revenues, to Dollars 144m, due to increased custody,
clearance and brokerage fees. Net investment securities gains totalled
Dollars 91m, down from Dollars 95m.
Other revenues totalled Dollars 103m, up from Dollars 85m, and included net
gains of Dollars 97m on sales from the bank's equity portfolio and Dollars
41m of hedging losses from the management of non-trading foreign currency
exposures.
Group operating expenses rose 5 per cent to Dollars 852m.
