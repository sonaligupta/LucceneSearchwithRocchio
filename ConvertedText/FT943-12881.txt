FT  22 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Purer products for
haemophiliacs


   By VANESSA HOULDER


Bio Products Laboratory, part of the National Blood Service, has launched a
highly purified blood product for the treatment of haemophilia.
Replenine is a concentrated form of purified Factor IX, the clotting agent
needed by people with haemophilia B to prevent bleeding. The Factor IX in
Replenine is 10,000 times purer than in the original plasma from which it is
manufactured.
The purification is based on metal chelate chromatography, a process that
uses copper to capture Factor IX from the plasma, while minimising damage to
the protein.
