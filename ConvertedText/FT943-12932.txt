FT  22 JUL 94 / Opencast mines get stricter standards


   By MICHAEL SMITH


The government said yesterday it was setting stricter environmental
standards for opencast coal mining as it published new planning guidance for
the industry.
Environmental campaigners welcomed what they saw as improvements on existing
guidance, in particular the removal of a statement that opencast was in the
'national interest'.
But the Council for the Protection of Rural England said important areas of
the countryside were still at risk from opencast devastation. It objected to
what it saw as the guidance's implication that opencast did not affect land
permanently.
The council and the Coalfield Communities Campaign said the full
implications of the fine print in the guidance would not be known until
tested in practice in the wake of coal privatisation later this year.
Mr David Curry, environment minister, said the guidance, which replaces a
1988 document, will give mineral planning authorities a framework to help
strike a balance between the economic importance of coal and the protection
of the environment.
Mr Stephen Fothergill, Coalfield Communities Campaign director, said
opencast mining was potentially one of the most damaging land uses.
He said: 'Local authorities fail to see why the government has for so long
been reluctant to rein back opencast coalmining when there is so obviously a
glut of coal on the market and when so many fine collieries are being
closed.'
The campaign believes the removal of the 'national interest' phrase from the
guidance is significant, however. Its inclusion in the 1988 guidance had
'made it easier to overrule local objections to opencasting at planning
inquiries than to overturn objections to any other form of development going
through the planning system'.
