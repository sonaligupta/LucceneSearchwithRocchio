FT  27 MAY 93 / Companies sign up for schools link


   By JOHN AUTHERS


BUSINESS IN the Community yesterday announced that it had enlisted the
support of 77 companies in a new initiative to build links with schools.
Its 'Aim High' campaign intends to improve on previous education-business
partnerships by using national education and training targets to monitor
their impact. It also hopes to encourage children to aim higher in their
careers and qualifications.
Mr Michael Heron, chairman of the Post Office and deputy chairman of
Business in the Community, launched the campaign at a primary school in
King's Cross, London, where volunteers from local businesses are used
extensively in classrooms. He said: 'For the first time business is
employing the best of business methods to the pressing needs of education.'
He hopes to enlist 500 companies during the next 12 months.
A survey of the 77 companies launching the initiative found that only 20 per
cent measured the effect of their involvement on children, and that less
than half had reviewed their education policy in the light of the national
targets.
Companies were found to provide strong support for work experience and in
providing material for the curriculum. However, almost 80 per cent of the
founder companies provided no support for parents, or for out-of-school
activities, and few helped with programmes involving direct personnel
involvement such as mentoring.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, and another leader of the 'Aim High' initiative, said the teaching
profession welcomed the move. He also called for greater emphasis on primary
schools, which - according to the survey - receive only a third as much
business support as secondary schools.
