FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (25): Airports of the world - Casino set
to open by end of year / Schiphol


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is heavily dependent on transit passengers and
goes out of its way to make connections easy. Though the airport is growing
rapidly in size, it remains under one roof, so there is no need for terminal
hopping.
The business traveller running from one gate to the other is sure to
encounter Schiphol's extensive array of duty-free shops. Besides the usual
cigarettes, alcohol, perfume and cosmetics, these sell diamonds, cameras and
televisions.
The latest sector to be added to duty-free sales is golf: Schiphol recently
became the first airport in the world to open an indoor centre, complete
with putting greens and driving ranges as well as a 'video-golf simulator'
which replicates 24 of the world's golf courses. There is even a
professional on hand for lessons.
The airport has two business centres, one for transit passengers and the
other for people already through immigration and customs. These have meeting
rooms and computers, and secretarial services can also be obtained. Other
airlines also have executive lounges.
For relaxation, there is a fitness centre, a sun centre, a sauna and a
hotel, all in the transit area.
At the end of the year, Schiphol plans to become the first airport to have a
casino, where departing and transit passengers will be able to play
blackjack and roulette and other games of chance.
The only drawback to Schiphol at the moment is the heavy programme of
construction, which can make finding the car parks a chore for people
driving to the airport.
