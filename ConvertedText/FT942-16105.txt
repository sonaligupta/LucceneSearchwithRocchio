FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Reconstruction boosts Orb


Financial reconstruction at Orb Estates helped the property company,
formerly known as Ossory Estates, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m for
the six months to end-December, against losses of Pounds 19.8m.
The result was helped by an exceptional credit of Pounds 10.3m, being the
elimination of subsidiaries in receivership, settlement with trade creditors
and the write-back of liabilities to banks.
There were also lower amounts written off properties and investments of
Pounds 897,000 (Pounds 8.74m) and interest charges of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds
9.94m).
Turnover was Pounds 4.04m, against Pounds 8.89m, which included Pounds 1.5m
from discontinued activities. Operating profits on continuing activities
were Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.77m).
The company said full benefits of the reconstruction were still to take
effect. Court permission for the reduction of the deficit on the profit and
loss account by Pounds 48m to Pounds 25m was received on February 18. A
revaluation of the assets will take place at the June 30 year end.
Earnings per share were 9.12p (losses 21.82p). Adjusting for the effect of
the reconstruction and taking into account the share issue, losses per share
were 0.16p.
