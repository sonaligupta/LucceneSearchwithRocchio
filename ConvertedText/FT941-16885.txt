FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Training tape jogs the memory


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Every personal computer user knows the problem with training: a day after
the course and the intricacies of the software are easily understood; a
month later and the mental fog has descended.
To replace the need to look up procedures, training specialist Futuremedia,
of West Sussex, has developed an audio cassette-based training system to jog
the memory.
The Q-PC comprises a small black box, plugged in between the PC and
keyboard, and a cassette, on which is a voice interspersed with audio
'bleeps'. When the cassette is played on a personal stereo, connected to the
PC, the voice instructs the user while the 'bleeps' instruct the PC to
perform the task.
Futuremedia has cassettes to help with popular software packages, or can
develop specific software. Large companies can buy a system to develop their
own training packages. Futuremedia: UK, 0243 555000.
