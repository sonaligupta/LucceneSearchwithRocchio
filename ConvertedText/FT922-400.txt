FT  27 JUN 92 / MPs see danger in BT vans' grey paint scheme


   By DAVID OWEN


IT IS the largest fleet of commercial vehicles in Europe. But is it the
right colour?
British Telecom is in the process of repainting about 70,000 yellow cars and
vans grey. But now Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry
spokesman, says the change is an example of a privatised utility pursuing 'a
corporate strategy that may well have compromised public safety'.
Indeed, three of the party's 20 MPs have put their names to a parliamentary
early day motion noting 'increasing public concern over the difficulty in
seeing BT vans when they are parked, due to their grey colour'.
The motion continues: 'Many British Telecom engineers are worried about
their safety due to the colour of their vans.' It urges Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, to talk to BT 'and ensure that better provisions are
made to make British Telecom vans more visible and thus safer'.
Mr Bruce said he had been told by BT employees of a number of 'near misses'.
He intended to try to win the support of MPs from other parties.
Mr Bruce has already secured the backing of the National Communications
Union, whose members use the vehicles.
The union said yesterday: 'It is vital that these vans are painted in the
safest possible colour.' It described the new livery as 'ghostly and
ghastly'.
BT said yesterday that it had no plans to make any changes to the new
design, which it announced in April last year.
It added: 'All the expert opinion we got said the new livery was as visible
as - if not more so than - the old livery.'
