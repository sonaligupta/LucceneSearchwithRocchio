FT  19 APR 94 / BNF pays worker Pounds 16,661 for idea


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


British Nuclear Fuels has paid out what is believed to be the largest ever
award in the UK to an employee for an idea.
The industrial worker at BNF's Sellafield reprocessing plant won Pounds
16,661 for a plan to increase efficiency, the company's staff newspaper
reports.
'Under our suggestion scheme workers receive 35 per cent of the first year's
savings if we put their idea into practice,' Mr Les Carrick, a senior
manager at Sellafield, told the magazine Personnel Today. A few other
workers have received several thousand pounds. Rewards of up to Pounds 100
are routine.
A survey by the UK Association of Suggestion Schemes says the average
savings generated by suggestion schemes is Pounds 265,000 a year per
workplace.
However the schemes at the social security department, Rover, British Rail
and the Inland Revenue have all regularly generated savings of more than
Pounds 1m. Rover also has one of the highest payout levels, making awards of
Pounds 1.25m last year for suggestions.
The average annual response to a suggestion scheme is 5 per cent of
employees, and an average of 22 per cent of suggestions are used by the
company.
The value of payments for suggestions used varies between about Pounds 15
and 50 per cent of any savings made in the first year of operation.
Mr Carrick told Personnel Today that BNF wants to upgrade its scheme and
involve more workers. 'Under the old scheme the bulk of suggestions were
from industrial workers,' he said. 'Under the new scheme we want everyone to
be involved.'
