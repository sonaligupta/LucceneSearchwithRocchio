FT  28 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Diving gold for China


World champion Fu Mingxia extended China's domination of women's diving by
winning the Olympic platform gold medal in breathtaking style.
Fu, 13, was diving against herself during the latter part of the
competition, so complete was her mastery over the other 11 entrants.
She eventually finished with 461.43 points, nearly 50 ahead of Elena
Mirochina of the Unified Team. Mary Ellen Clark of the US was third.
