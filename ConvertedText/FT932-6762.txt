FT  27 MAY 93 / Nissan halts recruiting as sales fall


   By CHRIS TIGHE


NISSAN, the Japanese car manufacturer, has frozen recruitment at its car
plant in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and is not retaining temporary contract
workers because of the fall in European car sales - 18 per cent down in the
first four months of this year.
But the company yesterday stressed that Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK and
its managing director Mr Ian Gibson were committed to ensuring there were no
redundancies at the plant. 'He (Mr Gibson) will fall on his sword before
that happens,' the company said.
The plant, widely regarded as one of the country's manufacturing success
stories and until recently apparently recession-proof, employs 4,600. If the
non-recruitment policy were sustained for 12 months there would be a drop of
about 230 employees, because the plant has about 5 per cent annual natural
wastage.
Job vacancies are being filled internally, though any highly specialist
posts may have to be advertised outside.
The plant has taken on temporary workers during surges in demand. Many of
these have been made permanent at the end of their contracts. But a month
ago the company decided to end this practice, affecting 51 temporary
employees. 'We accept there are some people out there who are very
disappointed that the temporary contract didn't turn into a permanent
contract,' said the company.
Mr Davey Hall, Tyne district secretary for the AEEU engineering union, which
has sole union status at Nissan, said last night: 'We are very perturbed at
the news in seeing the flagship of the north-east shrinking its workforce,
which will inevitably have a knock-on effect on its supply companies and our
union membership.'
The company is maintaining its plans to increase its overall UK output this
year by 51 per cent to 270,000 cars, from 179,000 in 1992.
But it has reduced planned 1993 production of the Primera from 130,000 to
110,000, and stepped up output of the Micra by 20,000 to compensate.
