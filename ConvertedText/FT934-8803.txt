FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Somic shares surge 23% on recovery


Shares in Somic surged by 23 per cent yesterday as the Preston-based maker
of yarns and woven fabrics reported what Mr Richard Blackburn, the chairman,
described as its 'best figures for 5 years'.
The shares, which touched 88p at one point, finished the day 15p up at 81p
after Somic announced that sales for the half year to September 30 grew by
24 per cent to Pounds 2.24m. This, combined with continuing cost saving
exercises, resulted in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 133,453.
In the same period last year there was a Pounds 10,151 loss, but better
trading conditions helped turn this round to an Pounds 81,249 profit at the
full year.
After a three year absence, the company is restoring the interim dividend
with a payment of 1p - last year's single final was 1.5p. Earnings per share
amounted to 4.47p (0.38p losses).
Mr Blackburn said the improvement in trading conditions had affected most
parts of the business, although there were still some areas yet to benefit.
