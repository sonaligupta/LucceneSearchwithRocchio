FT923-6536

FT  24 AUG 92 / Most current pay rises under 5%


MORE than half of pay rises are now worth between 4 per cent and 4.9 per
cent, according to Incomes Data Services, the independent pay research
group. This time last year two thirds of deals were worth 6 per cent to 8.9
per cent.
The number of new pay deals between 3 per cent to 3.9 per cent has grown to
19 this month while the number of 5 per cent to 5.9 per cent rises stands at
17. No new settlement is worth more than the 6.5 per cent increase for the
police from September.
Settlements are uneven across sectors, with pay rises in the chemicals and
allied industries mainly in the 4 per cent to 6 per cent range compared with
national agreements of 2.5 per cent in the construction sector.
