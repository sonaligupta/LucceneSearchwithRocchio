FT  20 APR 91 / Shake-up planned over teachers' pay


   By ANDREW ADONIS


THE GOVERNMENT will have powers to change the remit of the proposed
teachers' pay review body each year under the teachers' pay bill published
yesterday.
Ministers could therefore ask the review body to reach a pay settlement
within a specified range, as happened this year under existing methods for
determining pay.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, told the Commons on Wednesday
that the review body would not be cash-limited. However, the education
department yesterday acknowledged that ministers could seek to constrain the
body's financial discretion in future.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers, said: 'I would be very worried indeed if the power of direction
were to have financial consequences'.
The review body will replace the interim advisory committee which has
negotiated teachers' pay for the last four years.
The new body will resemble those in place for assessing the pay of doctors,
nurses, senior civil servants and members of the armed forces, but it will
consider teachers' conditions of service as well.
Of the six teachers' unions, only the National Union of Teachers opposes the
principle of a pay review body.
Mr Clarke has indicated that establishment of the review body is conditional
upon the unions relinquishing their right to strike, but the bill does not
contain a 'no-strike' clause.
The bill allows state schools which have opted out of local authority
control to negotiate their own pay and conditions, but the governing body of
each school must consult its teachers before doing so.
