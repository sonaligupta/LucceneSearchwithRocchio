ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, suffered a sharp fall in
fourth-quarter earnings as a result of heavy charges, amounting to Dollars
217m, relating to environmental clean-ups and restructuring costs.
Before the charges, fourth-quarter earnings were Dollars 25.6m, or 30 cents
a share, compared with Dollars 134.6m, or Dollars 1.58, for the 1990
quarter.
After the charges, Alcoa posted a loss of Dollars 191.4m, or Dollars 2.26,
in the final quarter of 1991, against a loss of Dollars 140.4m, or Dollars
1.61, for the year-ago period.
The company had warned it would take the charges earlier this month.
They are primarily related to cleaning up several operating plants around
the globe, though the costliest is for its smelting and fabricating plant in
Massena, New York.
With prices having dropped for virtually all aluminium products last year,
the company reported that before the charges, its 1991 net income was
Dollars 279.7m, or Dollars 3.27 a share, compared with Dollars 570.2m, or
Dollars 6.59, in 1990.
Once the charges were taken, the 1991 net income shrank to Dollars 62.7m, or
71 cents, compared with Dollars 295.2m, or Dollars 3.40, in 1990.
For the fourth quarter, Alcoa's revenues were Dollars 2.4bn, down from 2.7bn
in the year-ago period, while revenues for all of 1991 slipped to Dollars
10bn, down from Dollars 10.9bn in 1990.
Shipments increased last year to 2.8m metric tons from 2.7m 1n 1990.
