FT  19 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): The single market leaves
bosses cold - In A Nutshell


British companies are more dismissive of the likely impact of the single
European market than French and Danish counterparts, according to a survey*
by accountants Grant Thornton.
Thirty-seven per cent of small- and medium-sized businesses polled in the UK
viewed the proposed market as irrelevant, compared with only 18 per cent of
French businesses and 25 per cent of Danish companies.
Despite these sizeable minorities, more than half the companies in all three
countries plan to develop new markets, in particular inside the European
Community. Joint ventures and strategic alliances are the favoured means of
expansion in preference to outright acquisitions.
