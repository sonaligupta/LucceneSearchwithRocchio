FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Knapp demands limit on working hours
at BR


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


THE LEADER of the largest rail union yesterday called for a mandatory limit
on the hours British Rail staff can work after it was revealed that
thousands of staff worked longer than permitted by safety guidelines.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT rail union, said that -
according to BR's own figures for last year - staff worked more than 72
hours a week on 3,100 occasions, and that on 6,700 occasions staff worked
shifts of more than 12 hours.
Last year BR issued guidelines which laid down a maximum of six days or 72
hours per working week, and a maximum of 12 hours per shift following the
independent inquiry into the Clapham rail disaster in 1988, in which 35
people died. The working of excessive overtime was criticised by the
inquiry.
He added that BR was not even meeting targets that the union regarded as
minima. He was also concerned that the figures disguised the true weekly
picture of hours worked because some workers were carrying over hours worked
in one week to the next.
Mr Knapp expressed concern that signals and telecommunications staff - those
involved at Clapham - are not meeting the safety guidelines, according to
the figures. He said there were 172 occasions when signals and
telecommunications staff worked more than 72 hours in one week in November.
He also called for more government funding so that BR can meet the current
guidelines.
BR said yesterday that the amount of excessive hours worked by staff had
been significantly reduced.
