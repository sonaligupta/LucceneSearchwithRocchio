FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Single premium business ahead by 19% at CU


Commercial Union, the composite insurance group, reported a 19 per cent
increase in new life assurance and pensions business during 1991.
In common with Prudential, which announced new business figures earlier in
the week, most of the gain came from single-premium business which increased
19 per cent to Pounds 597.8m.
There was a 9 per cent increase to Pounds 146.3m in annual premiums, which
are seen as being more vulnerable to a recession.
Single premiums to personal pensions accounted for much of the rise, while
new annual premiums for life policies fell by 2 per cent.
