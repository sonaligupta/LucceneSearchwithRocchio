FT  27 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peer ends 43 years of silence in
House


A LORD who followed a tradition of not speaking until he had something to
say made his maiden speech to the House of Lords yesterday - 43 years after
he took up his seat.
'I am pleased to make my somewhat overdue maiden speech in a debate which
affects my locality considerably,' said 64-year-old Lord Trevor, who entered
the Lords in 1950.
His lordship, the fourth baron in his Welsh lineage, broke his silence in a
debate on proposals for new committees to oversee the police.
He said that the proposed changes were 'drastic' and bad for morale.
Lord Allen of Abbeydale congratulated him on 'breaking the ice', adding: 'I
hope it won't be too long before we hear you again.'
Asked why he had taken so long to speak, Lord Trevor did not waste words: 'I
think the quick, short and truthful answer to that question is that I have
waited for something that affected the locality in which I live.'
Was he a man of few words? 'Most definitely,' the peer declared.
