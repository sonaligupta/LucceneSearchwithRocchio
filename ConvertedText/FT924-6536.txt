FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Japanese blades at the cutting edge


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Razor maker Wilkinson Sword has turned to Japanese steel technology to give
Europe's shavers a safer shave. The dual blade on its Protector shaving
system uses non-corrosive steel which is especially hard to ensure that the
blade retains its cutting edge. To make sure the blades do not nick the
skin, 10 filaments of wire straddle the blades. Wilkinson Sword: Germany,
212 405 230; UK, 0670 713421.
