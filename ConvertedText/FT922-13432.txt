FT  11 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Sharing my house


MY HOUSE is registered in my name only. I assume that if it were shared
between my wife and myself, death duties would be reduced?
There is no inheritance tax (formerly death duties) chargeable on gifts made
by one spouse to the other. Hence the use of joint ownership to save
inheritance tax is only relevant between spouses where it is intended to
make a gift of a part or all of the half share of the first to die to
someone other than the surviving spouse. A formal transfer or conveyance
into joint names (to hold as tenants in common in equity) can be used, or a
declaration of trust followed by the appointment of a new trustee.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
