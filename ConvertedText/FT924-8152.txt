FT  12 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Howard 'confident' that council tax
will be seen as fair replacement for poll tax


   By IVOR OWEN


MR Howard told MPs he was 'confident' the council tax would be seen as a
fair replacement for the poll tax when it was introduced next April, Ivor
Owen writes.
He brushed aside a prediction by Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment
secretary, that the government would be 'profoundly embarrassed' when it
became known that the average charge would be far in excess of the Pounds
400 the public had been led to expect.
Labour MPs disputed Mr Howard's assertion that the government had never
forecast the likely level of the new tax.
Mr Straw brandished a sheaf of papers containing figures he claimed had been
produced on the instructions of Mr Michael Heseltine, the former environment
secretary, for use in the approach to last April's general election.
These had been 'entirely bogus' and were intended to deceive the electorate,
Mr Straw said.
Mr Howard accused Mr Straw of 'cheap misrepresentation' and insisted 'no
predictions were made'.
Labour MPs jeered when Mr Howard said the figure referred to by Mr Straw
were subject to caveats 'clearly spelled out at the time'.
They were not forecasts, and had never been represented as such.
