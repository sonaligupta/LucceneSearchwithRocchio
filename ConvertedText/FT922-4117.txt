FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chemical Bank lifts prime rate


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


CHEMICAL Bank yesterday increased its prime lending rate from 6.25 per cent
to 6.5 per cent to bring it into line with other US banks.
Two months ago, in anticipation of a cut by the Federal Reserve, Chemical
cut its own prime rate to 6.25 per cent.
The hoped-for cut by the Fed, however, never materialised, and Chemical's
lower prime rate failed to attract any additional customer loan business. A
spokesman said yesterday: 'We don't see any further easing (of monetary
policy) in the short term, so we are going back in line with the market.'
