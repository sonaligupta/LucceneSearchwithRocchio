FT  15 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Drummond tumbles Pounds 3.4m into the red


OPERATIONAL difficulties arising from the integration of acquisitions and
the introduction of new equipment, as well as the effects of recession, were
behind a fall into losses at Drummond Group.
The company, which makes fabrics and associated products for the clothing
industry, reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 3.38m after net
reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.6m in the year to end-March.
The outcome compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.14m last time and was
struck on turnover down from Pounds 48.4m to Pounds 45.6m.
Profits at the operating level were Pounds 116,000 (Pounds 2.03m).
Losses per share were 22.63p (4.59p earnings). There is no dividend; in
1991-92 a total of 1.5p was paid.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said the integration of Crowthers and
Courtauld Woollens, and Armatex, the group's man-made fibres division, had
taken longer to achieve than expected, while the re-equipping of the worsted
operation with modern plant had yet to show results.
