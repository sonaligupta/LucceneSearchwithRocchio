FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei closes at day's
low as trading volume falls

   TOKYO


SHARE prices fell moderately in low activity, as investors remained inactive
ahead of the Bank of Japan's branch managers' meeting which starts today.
Volume fell to 130m shares, the lowest level since August 3, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 106.32 to close at the day's low of 17,011.33. The
index moved within a narrow range, briefly hitting the day's high of
17,153.76 in the afternoon session.
Declines led advances by 594 to 305 with 187 issues remaining unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks lost 7.99 to 1,288.70 and in London,
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.21 to 1,036.35.
Traders said that while sentiment remained subdued, growing expectations of
a cut in the official discount rate prevented active selling. Market
participants hope that the central bank's meeting of regional managers will
shed some light on monetary policy. 'Lower interest rates will increase the
money flow, pushing up volume,' said Mr Takatoshi Okuyama, strategist at
Daiwa Securities.
However, a fund manager at Nippon Life, the leading life assurer, said that
he would not be in a hurry to buy even if interest rates declined. 'We would
have to see good profit figures, and an improvement in economic indicators
reflecting a recovery,' he said.
Investors remained on the sidelines ahead of this week's spate of corporate
earnings announcements. Leading electronics makers, such as Matsushita
Electric Industrial and NEC announce their interim profits today, while
ship-builders are scheduled to report half-year profits at the end of the
week.
Fears that the higher yen would hurt interim earnings at exporters prompted
light selling. Hitachi fell Y3 to Y710 and Fujitsu Y4 to Y553.
Dealers took profits on speculative issues which rose last week. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which surged on Friday on reports of its success in
room-temperature nuclear fusion research, lost Y30,000 to Y567,000. Aisin
Seiki, which also gained on the same theme, was the most active issue of the
day, falling Y20 to Y1,140.
Issues related to Alzheimer's disease cures gained ground. Snow Brand Milk
advanced Y15 to Y795 and Takeda Chemical added Y10 to Y1,240.
Some dealers looked for quick profits in public works-related issues,
pushing up road stocks and bridge builders. Maeda Road Construction gained
Y50 to Y2,700 and Yokogawa Bridge Y40 to Y1,110.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 22.29 to 18,725.81 in volume of 20m shares.
Roundup
SINGAPORE, Kuala Lumpur, Taiwan and New Zealand were all closed yesterday
for public holidays. Meanwhile, trading in Manila was cancelled after
Typhoon Colleen unleashed torrential rains on the capital.
HONG KONG ended sharply lower as investors took profits after Beijing
attacked Governor Chris Patten's plans to widen democracy in Hong Kong. The
Hang Seng Index closed 200.07 or 3.2 per cent lower at 6,062.47, having
fallen to the day's low of 6,012.94 at the opening.
HSBC Holdings, which topped the most active list, fell HKDollars 2 to
HKDollars 60 and its unit Hang Seng Bank also lost HKDollars 2 to close at
HKDollars 52.50. Cheung Kong eased HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 22.90 and
Hutchison Whampoa slid 80 cents to HKDollars 16.80.
SEOUL closed sharply higher on across-the-board buying inspired by news that
the Daewoo Group chairman had denied political aspirations. The composite
stock index jumped 24.88 to 582.74, as 684 shares went limit-up. Turnover
totalled Won423.7bn after Saturday's half-day Won325.82bn.
Daewoo Corp recorded the greatest turnover of 2.61m of the 36.41m shares
traded. It rose Won400 to close limit-up at Won9,500.
AUSTRALIA ended a four-day climb when it closed near its lows for the day in
uncertain trading. The All Ordinaries index ended 4.9 lower at 1,450.7 in
turnover of ADollars 151.8m.
The biggest loser was National Australia Bank which plunged 17 cents to
ADollars 6.95 amid rumours it was considering a paper bid for ANZ. NAB had
no comment and ANZ dropped 1 cent to ADollars 2.94.
BANGKOK's SET index gained 11.12 or 1.2 per cent to close at 913.88, its
highest close since August 17 1990, on the back of a strong baking sector.
Turnover was active at Bt13.11bn. Krung Thai Bank jumped Bt22 to Bt260.
