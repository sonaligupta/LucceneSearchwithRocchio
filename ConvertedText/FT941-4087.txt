FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues


   By JOHN THORNHILL


Beazer Homes, one of the UK's four biggest national house-builders, is being
split off from the Hanson conglomerate and floated into a buoyant stock
market sector, writes John Thornhill. The placing and public offer, arranged
by Lazard Brothers, values Beazer Homes at Pounds 463.4m. The issue price of
165p a share equates to 14.5 times historic earnings and gives a notional
gross dividend yield of 3.8 per cent. That is a modest rating relative to
the sector.
Beazer Homes has strong management, a relatively cheap land bank, and a
sound balance sheet. It will receive Pounds 50m of the flotation proceeds to
help fund its expansion programme. Its earnings growth is likely to prove
less dynamic than that produced by many other house-builders, though. The
company already has high margins and will rely chiefly on volume growth to
expand profits.
House-building is a highly cyclical industry which is in the early stages of
an up-swing. Last year, the industry had its first year of growth since
1988, with the number of new completions rising 5 per cent to 148,100. At
the last peak, in 1988, builders completed 203,000 new houses.
