FT  16 MAR 94 / Oxfam attack on World Bank


   By MICHAEL HOLMAN


Oxfam, the British charity, yesterday called for 'an open acknowledgment of
the scale of sub-Saharan Africa's development failure', Michael Holman
reports. World Bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to
'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty,' it said.
Adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through
interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets'. Poorly-planned import
liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local
industries to ruinous competition from imports'. Oxfam accused the bank of
'complacency' in the face of Africa's 'deepening development crisis'.
