FT  30 OCT 93 / Property: Somerset's different worlds - Gerald Cadogan finds
a wide variety of houses on offer in the heart of the West Country


   By GERALD CADOGAN


JULIUS Caesar would have divided Somerset into two or three parts. The
rolling hills of the east, on the border with Dorset, are a different world
from the plateau of Exmoor, the county's west end.
Exmoor has sheep, stag hunting, and ancient hedgerows from which huge
beeches sprout. Its steep and narrow valleys conceal burbling rivers, with
pools for a bracing bathe that return you to the days before heated swimming
pools in the garden. Its heroine is Lorna Doone, made famous by novelist RD
Blackmore.
East Somerset is gentle country. Long, low stone houses are tucked into the
hills or lie in a village at the bottom of the valley. Handsome churches
show how the county prospered in the Middle Ages. And there is a sense that,
in this haven of clematis and roses, it is always afternoon and time for a
cup of tea or the first glass of white wine.
In the middle, between Exmoor and the Dorset borders, lie the flat lands of
the Glastonbury levels, and the Sedgemoor marsh, and the Vale of Taunton
Deane which the M5 crosses. Here, the Duke of Monmouth started his revolt
against James II in 1685, and was routed. Judge Jeffreys' Bloody Assizes
followed. The Quantock hills separate this vale, packed with history, from
the wild country of Exmoor.
The M5, Somerset's main artery, goes south to Exeter, Plymouth and France,
and north to the rest of England and its motorway network. Caravans bound
for Devon and Cornwall crowd it in summer. The other links are the railway
to London - which sometimes has long delays and re-routings when floods wash
away the ballast; and, for east Somerset, the A303, the modern highway of
Wessex.
Close to the A303 is the thatched Rodwell Manor at West Lambrook, a long
house which has, as a centrepiece, a mid-16th century great hall. The house,
listed Grade II, comes with five acres and looks over the National Trust
land at Barrington Court (which will not be built on). Jackson-Stops is
asking Pounds 475,000.
Pendomer Manor, south-west of Yeovil, is another long house of similar date
which once was the rectory for the church next door. Buried there is a
knight who might be one Sir John de Domer. For a chance to be the late-20th
century squire, attend Humberts' auction in Hardington Mandeville village
hall on November 11 (7.30 pm). Humberts also will be selling Eastfield at
Hardington Mandeville: two farmworkers' cottages now made into one larger
cottage with a garden around enclosed by a low stone wall.
For cottages on Exmoor, Stags is an agent to consult, and Gribble Booth
Taylor has a good list of village properties. At Seavington St Michael, near
Crewkerne, Jackson-Stops is selling Orchard Cottage, at the end of a
no-through-lane, for Pounds 180,000. 'John Skellen May 25 1689' is inscribed
on the wall in plaster, and the thatched roof received a new ridge last
year.
At Compton Dundon, four miles from Glastonbury, Michael de Pelet (in
association with Knight Frank & Rutley) offers Castlebrook Cottage, a long,
thatched village house with Honeysuckle Cottage in the grounds, for Pounds
255,000. De Pelet also has the cottage-style Four Gables; this is listed
Grade II, presumably for the unusual gables at either end which make it look
like the model for a fairy story. The guide price is Pounds 360,000. Cheaper
is Fosseway, with some mullion windows and exposed beams, in Hinton St
George near Crewkerne: Pounds 265,000 from Jackson-Stops.
Farmhouses on offer start with Pightley, at Spaxton on the edge of the
Quantocks, with nine acres and priced at Pounds 125,000-Pounds 150,000 by
Greenslade Hunt. It needs total renovation but has a good position. South of
Shepton Mallet, Kilkenny Farmhouse is half a mile from the Roman Fosse Way
(A37) and, with a stable yard and 3.5 acres, costs Pounds 325,000-Pounds
350,000 from Cluttons. Two barn conversions are Park Barn at Castle Cary
(Jackson-Stops, Pounds 245,000) and Home Barn at East Compton near Shepton
Mallet (Cluttons, Pounds 215,000).
Just over the Devon border, and new on the market, Stags is selling Lodfin
Farm at Bampton with 110 acres and farm buildings for Pounds 465,000. At
Winsford, on Exmoor, the same firm offers The Tufters, with a licenced
hiring yard for 10 horses in prime hunting country. Apart from the Devon &
Somerset staghounds, five packs of foxhounds meet within five miles. The
price for this retirement sale is Pounds 350,000.
If Victorian rectories are your taste, Cluttons has the Old Vicarage at
Pilton, near Shepton Mallet, which is lucky still to have its coach house
(now converted as a three-bedroom house). Often, a diocese has sold these
separately or pulled them down to allow space for re-building. The price is
around Pounds 325,000.
If your house has to be Georgian, Humberts and de Pelet offer Cheriton
House, in South Cheriton near Wincanton; this has 26 acres, a swimming pool
and outbuildings for Pounds 420,000. De Pelet also will sell Magnolia House
at Watchfield, close to the M5 (junction 22) and needing renovation, by
informal tender on November 24; offers in the Pounds 150,000-Pounds 200,000
range are suggested.
For Pounds 280,000, he offers the Old Rectory at Limington, near Yeovil, and
Grove House at Baltonsborough, near Glastonbury.
The Great House at Edington, near Bridgewater, is on offer from Greenslade
Hunt for Pounds 240,000. But the handsomest Georgian property is Haygrass
House in Haygrass, near Taunton, from Humberts for Pounds 550,000; for
Pounds 155,000 more, there are cottages and a further 17 acres.
Finally, there are two solid, Edwardian houses. Ham Court at High Ham -
built, rightly, with some Ham stone - costs Pounds 400,000 from
Jackson-Stops. The same agent (with Grimley JR Eve) is selling Coker House
at East Coker, built with much more Ham stone, for Pounds 450,000. Recently,
it was an old people's home.
TS Eliot is buried in East Coker church. His family left the village to
emigrate to America, but he came home. In the East Coker part of The Four
Quartets, he writes: 'In my beginning is my end, in my end is my beginning.'
