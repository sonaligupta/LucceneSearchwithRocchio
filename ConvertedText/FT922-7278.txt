FT  19 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Total


At first sight, the French government's decision to reduce its stake in
Total looks curious. The world market for oil assets is severely depressed,
European refining margins are weak and Total's first-half results are
expected to be poor. All the same, its shares have performed well in recent
years, supported lately by overseas demand on hopes for the Cusiana field in
Colombia.
Like the recent sale of 2.3 per cent of Elf, selling most of the Total stake
fits the policy of tidying up holdings as part of a wider privatisation
programme. Were it not for the group's complicated share structure, the sale
might raise FFr9bn (Pounds 900m). The more likely figure is nearer FFr6bn,
which will scarcely ease the budget deficit.
