FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Country Casuals declines to Pounds 117,000


   By PETER FRANKLIN


COUNTRY CASUALS, the women's wear group that in April acquired one of its
suppliers - House of Lerose - in a Pounds 10.8m agreed offer, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 405,000 to Pounds 117,000 for the
six months to July 24.
Mr John Shannon, chairman, said the downturn was largely due to the current
economic environment and the costs associated with the setting up of the
Wild Women chain - now trading as Koto.
Turnover, boosted by an Pounds 832,000 contribution from new operations,
grew to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 14.8m). The pre-tax outcome was bolstered by
net interest income up from Pounds 12,000 to Pounds 108,000.
Mr Shannon said the group retained a strong balance sheet, with a net cash
posi-tion after borrowings of Pounds 3.2m.
An interim dividend of 1.41p is declared, uncovered by earnings per share of
0.41p (1.88p).
The Country Casuals spring/summer collection was launched in a difficult
economic environment, Mr Shannon said, and for the first time the company
had seen its core customer base reacting to the recession by purchasing
fewer units per transaction.
However, the autumn/winter collection had made a good start, with a high
level of sales growth compared with that of last year.
The Wild Women chain was formed in the final quarter of last year as a 100
per cent subsidiary of Country Casuals with Ted Baker supplying merchandise
and design. However, the 'aspirations of the two parties proved
incompatible', Mr Shannon said, which caused operational problems in the
shops.
The design and supply of merchandise has now been brought in-house and the
name changed to Koto, said Mr Shannon, and stock throughput had increased
dramatically.
The Elvi brand was targeted for expansion over the next 18 months with a
further 20 to 30 shops planned, while the Lerose Manufacturing busi-ness was
also trading well, he said.
The company planned, however, to run down the wholesale operations of Lerose
to concentrate on the group's main objective of brand retailing. It was also
intended to dispose of or close the textile printing operation in the
Netherlands.
