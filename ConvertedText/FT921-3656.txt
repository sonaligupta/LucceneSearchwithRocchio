FT  13 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: NatWest


The decision by the trade and industry secretary to reopen the Blue Arrow
inquiry is an astonishing condemnation of the UK system of regulation. One
departmental inquiry and subsequent trial have already cost the taxpayer
nearly Pounds 40m. Now, suddenly, more money is to be spent examining
allegations made in court last summer and subsequently widely reported in
the press.
It is a mystery that the government should have delayed so long initiating
an investigation into facts which should have been fully established in the
original inquiry. But it is equally perplexing that National Westminster
waited until the allegations were revived by The Economist before seeking an
inquiry. The position of Mr Tom Frost, National Westminster chief executive,
is unenviable. He utterly rejects the suggestion which emerged in last
year's court proceedings that he was involved in the cover-up. Now he faces
a long wait to have his name cleared. Perhaps, however, in view of the
continuing embarrassment to the bank, it would still be better for him to
stand down until that process is complete.
