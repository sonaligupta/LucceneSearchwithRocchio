FT  16 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Thai toll road wrangle ends


   By WILLIAM BARNES


   BANGKOK


A 15km motorway from the centre of Bangkok almost to the city's
international airport was opened yesterday, two years late. The Don Muang
Tollway Company expects to be able to complete its delayed Bt12bn (Dollars
478m) stock market listing and raise Dollars 50m following its victory in a
contract wrangle with the government. The original contract drawn up
stipulated that two flyovers competing with the motorway would be knocked
down. After a long row, the government decided to have the flyovers turned
90 degrees to serve east-west traffic and this week gave the company
permission to build a 5.5km extension to the airport.
