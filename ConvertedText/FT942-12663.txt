FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Brixton Estate net asset value rise below
estimates


   By SIMON DAVIES


Brixton Estate yesterday announced a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 30.5m.
The UK's seventh largest property company also revealed that it has invested
the entire Pounds 100m proceeds of its May rights issue in UK properties,
and is planning to invest a further Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m in the current
year.
Net asset value per share rose 14 per cent to 192p (168p), which was below
analysts' expectations, and the shares fell 6p to 224p.
The value of Brixton's portfolio, excluding last year's acquisitions,
increased by only 6.5 per cent (7.4 per cent, excluding the impact of
currency). This reflected the weak performance of the 17 per cent of its
portfolio outside the UK.
Mr Terence Nagle, managing director, said demand for space in the UK had
increased over the past few months. Brixton achieved new lettings and
relettings of 800,000 sq ft last year, leaving a vacancy rate of 7.4 per
cent.
Net rental income rose 9 per cent to Pounds 60.2m, while interest on
developed properties increased 3 per cent to Pounds 27.2m. There was a
further Pounds 7.4m of interest charged to the cost of ongoing property
developments, equal to the rental value of its unlet property.
The effect of recovering property values together with the cash from the
rights issue, helped reduce gearing from 114 per cent to 72 per cent.
Last year, the company invested Pounds 75m of the rights issue proceeds in
new properties, and it has invested a further Pounds 25m since the year end.
These properties are yielding 11 per cent, significantly above the cost of
long-term money.
A proposed final dividend of 5.175p makes a total of 8p for the year.
Earnings per share, adjusted for the rights, fell 8 per cent to 11.66p.
COMMENT
Brixton achieved consistent profits growth through the downturn in the
property market, but is looking unexciting in the upswing. For a company
with few development projects, Pounds 7.4m capitalised interest is high, and
its further reduction will hurt future earnings. Analysts expect net asset
value per share to rise to 225p at the end of 1994, and the company is
likely to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 34m, given few rental reversions
this year. With no premium to year-end net asset value and little earnings
growth to come, the shares look pricey.
