FT  30 JAN 92 / Letter: Treasury double-speak that denies companies project
finance


   From Mr PETER MCGREGOR


Sir, In the row over the EC regional aid one important factor seems to have
been missed. This is that the Treasury's interpretation of the word
'additionality' when in receipt of EC funds is completely opposite to its
interpretation when UK finance is being provided.
A good example was the Product and Process Development Scheme (now
suspended) of the Department of Trade and Industry, designed to assist
companies to develop prototypes. Here the Treasury refused to agree to
support being given if work on the prototype had already started, since
'there was no additionality', in other words the work would be done whether
or not government support was provided. In practice the result was that some
companies' second best projects were financed, while, according to
information to which I had access at the time, others with a good product
could not finance it and had to sell it off to foreign competitors.
We shall really become a laughing stock if in addition to our ignorance of
foreign languages we do not even know what our own words mean, or give them
two opposing meanings. Federalism, subsidiarity, and now additionality.
