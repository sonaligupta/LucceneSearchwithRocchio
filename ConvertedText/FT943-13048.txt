FT  21 JUL 94 / New home loans up 38%


   By ALISON SMITH


New mortgage lending by building societies rose sharply last month to reach
its highest level for almost two years, in contrast to some other recent
indicators which have cast doubt on the housing market recovery.
But alongside the increase in lending was an outflow in retail funds from
societies so that significant reliance for mortgage funding was placed on
money raised in the wholesale markets and interest credited to retail
accounts.
According to figures published yesterday by the Building Societies'
Association, net new lending totalled Pounds 1.14bn in June - a 38 per cent
increase on the Pounds 830m figure for May, and higher also than the Pounds
976m recorded in June last year.
Gross new lending, which takes no account of repayments of principal, rose
to more than Pounds 3bn in June for the first time since March. It totalled
Pounds 3.22bn compared with Pounds 2.93bn in May.
There was also an increase in net new commitments made by societies, which
rose from Pounds 3.29bn in May to Pounds 3.58bn in June. Because the
commitments given take some weeks to translate into loans, these figures are
seen as an important leading indicator for the direction of the market in
the coming months.
Although the figures were more positive than other recent housing market
indicators, Mr Adrian Coles, association director-general, was wary of
predicting a sustained and strong recovery.
'Caution is still needed in what continues to be an uncertain market,' he
said before adding that building societies' market share had been rising
this year.
