FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: GE Capital hints at increasing
Kemper bid

   CHICAGO


Mr Gary Wendt, president of GE Capital, yesterday suggested his company
might increase its Dollars 2.2bn bid for Kemper Corporation and accused
Kemper's chief executive of 'stonewalling' on the merger negotiations.
In a letter to Mr David Mathis, Kemper chairman, Mr Wendt said: 'We have the
money available to pay any price we agree to. Your shareholders will be
rewarded if you will stop stonewalling and begin negotiations.'
However, responding to the letter, Mr Mathis said Kemper's major
shareholders supported the board's decision to reject GE Capital's offer.
'Your ongoing Dollars 55 per share proposal, found by our board and its
financial adviser to be inadequate, has been and continues to be rejected,'
Mr Mathis said.
GE Capital's suggestion that it might pay more for the diversified
securities and insurance company came as Kemper reported an improvement in
first-quarter earnings.
Operating earnings rose to Dollars 35.4m, or 87 cents a share in the
quarter, from Dollars 10.4m, or 17 cents, in the same quarter of 1993.
First-quarter 1993 results include an extraordinary charge of Dollars 11.9m
or 24 cents. Kemper's first-quarter revenues rose to Dollars 464.5m, from
Dollars 419.2 in the same quarter last year.
Kemper's troubled real estate division made significant progress in the
quarter, showing a net loss of Dollars 2.3m, or 6 cents a share, compared
with a 1993 first-quarter loss of Dollars 30.9m, or 63 cents a share.
The company's life insurance division saw operating earnings rise to Dollars
28.8m, from last year's Dollars 17.9m. However, results from Kemper's asset
management and securities operations were flat, and assets under management
fell during the quarter to Dollars 67.4bn, from Dollars 69.3bn at the end of
last year's first quarter.
