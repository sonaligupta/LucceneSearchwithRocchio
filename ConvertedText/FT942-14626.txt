FT  19 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in steep decline as Fed
tightens

Wall Street
US stocks followed the bond market in steep decline yesterday after the
announcement of a further tightening of monetary policy, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 41.05 lower at 3,620.42, while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was down 3.72 at 442.46. Declining
issues overwhelmed advances, 1,642 to 626 in brisk trading.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite dropped 4.29 to 434.00,
and the Nasdaq composite 7.52 to 720.45.
The market was jolted into life by the 10am announcement by the Federal
Reserve that it would 'increase slightly' pressure on the banking system's
reserve positions.
The action is expected to result in a small boost in the overnight
inter-bank lending rate, the third increase since the Fed warned of a shift
to more 'neutral' credit conditions in early February. As in the past, the
move triggered a sharp response in the US Treasury market, where the
benchmark 30-year government bond led the yield curve in hasty retreat.
Blue chips immediately plunged 45 points on the news, with other market
indices showing similar levels of decline. But as bonds began to firm near
midday, share prices reversed course and began to recover some lost ground.
In the afternoon, share price slipped again. Cyclical stocks, which shot up
in the weeks before the Fed's initial policy move, continued to suffer the
most. Alcoa gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 , General Motors lost
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 56 7/8 and Allied Signal dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 34 1/2 .
General Electric was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 94 3/4 . The company
announced at the weekend a Dollars 350m charge against first-quarter
earnings after uncovering a fraudulent trad ing scheme at its Kidder Peabody
brokerage subsidiary.
Digital Equipment, down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 21 1/8 , continued to feel
the impact of its disappointing first-quarter performance. It near the top
of the NYSE's most active list after Smith Barney Shearson downgraded the
stock.
Canada
Toronto prices tumbled in moderate trading, led by a steep drop in gold
stocks. The TSE 300 index plunged 71.89 points, or 1.70 per cent, to
4,168.06.
Declines led advances 572 to 211, the volume of 55.11m shares was below
Friday's 64.09m, and trading value was CDollars 601.0m compared with
CDollars 674.2m.
All 14 stock groups fell, with golds posting the biggest loss of 4.62 per
cent on index. Mexico
Equities closed sharply weaker as prices trailed Wall Street. The key IPC
index lost 61.02 points, or 2.78 per cent, to 2,137.62.
The market was also hit by fears of an increase in domestic interest rates
at the weekly auction.
On Wall Street Telmex ADRs ended down Dollars 2 at Dollars 55, the lowest
level this year. In the local market Telmex A shares retreated 4.33 per cent
and the L series dropped 4.13 per cent.
