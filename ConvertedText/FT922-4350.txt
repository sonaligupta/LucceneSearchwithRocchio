FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Change in overseeing of financial
regulation


   By DAVID OWEN


RESPONSIBILITY for regulating financial markets and non-bank financial
services will shift to the Treasury from the Department of Trade and
Industry next week, nearly three months after the change was foreshadowed in
the Conservative manifesto.
The move will bring together responsibility for overseeing wholesale
financial markets, such as those for foreign exchange and gilts, and
wholesale investment markets, such as those for stocks and bonds.
It will necessitate the transfer over the weekend of about 50 DTI officials.
It is understood that the move was delayed by legal difficulties.
The government's proposals have given rise to a series of questions in the
City about the future regulation of London's financial markets.
In particular, they have fuelled a belief among some regulators that the
Bank of England will eventually become more involved in overseeing all
London wholesale markets.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in April that
the shift reflected developments in financial markets. 'The barriers between
the different industries are crumbling.'
Mr Nelson also argued that the switch would give more weight to the UK
financial sector's views on the international stage.
Negotiations are in train within the EC over the remaining measures needed
to flesh out areas of common supervisory practice, with directives on
capital adequacy and deposit protection high on the Brussels agenda.
