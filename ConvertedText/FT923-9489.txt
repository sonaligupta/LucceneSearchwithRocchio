FT  05 AUG 92 / Observer: Clearing out the bankers


What a shambles. The revolving door at the top of NatWest continues to spin
faster than most in London's accident-prone securities industry. Yesterday,
Sir Geoffrey Littler and John Drury, who little more than a year ago were
appointed chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment Bank, the
parent of County NatWest, headed for the exit.
Their departure may have been inevitable following the reorganisation
earlier this year which saw first Derek Wanless, and then Martin Owen,
clearing bankers through and through, put in charge of a new corporate
octopus called NatWest Markets. Even so it means that this side of the
business must have had half a dozen chiefs in as many years.
Whereas there were supposed to be three senior managing directors under
NatWest Markets new chief executive Martin Owen, Drury's departure means
that there is now only one, Roger Byatt, another career clearing banker. The
lower orders seem equally confused. Presumably, the gaps will soon be
plugged but given the recent record it would be surprising if it did not
result in a fresh twirl of the door from the executive dining rooms.
