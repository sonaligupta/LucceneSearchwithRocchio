FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Thumbs up to control device


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


A TINY control device, just 1.6 inches square, could replace the ubiquitous
computer mouse for use with laptop computers.
The Thumbelina incorporates a mini-trackball, which can be moved around
using the thumb while the device is held in the palm of the hand. Two
buttons on the surface enable the user to 'click' on to files. A third
button enables the user to highlight chunks of text or data by 'clicking' on
at the beginning of the section and a second time at the end.
Because it has a three-feet long cable the Thumbelina, which has been
developed by Appoint, of Paso Robles, California, and is sold in the UK by
KSI, of Milford-on-Sea, Hampshire, can also be used for giving
presentations.
