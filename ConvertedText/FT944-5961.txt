FT  01 DEC 94 / The Budget: Difficult hurdles which Labour has to negotiate


   By DAVID OWEN


Next Tuesday's vote is the first of at least two hurdles Labour must clear
if it is to block the proposed increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent in
the rate of value added tax on domestic fuel.
If Labour wins this vote, with the help of the other opposition parties and
a few Tory rebels, the effect would be to enable MPs to table amendments or
new clauses on the subject. These could be considered during the Commons'
detailed scrutiny of the finance bill which implements the Budget.
Labour might choose to table an amendment at the committee stage. But party
strategists think it would be unlikely to win the day. This is because they
think it would be difficult to ensure the amendment was voted on by all MPs,
as opposed to the standing committee set up specifically to scrutinise the
bill.
The standing committee usually consists of between 20 and 30 MPs, with the
government expecting to command a majority capable of overturning such
controversial amendments.
Labour strategists believe their prospects are much better in the subsequent
report stage, where they would be able to table a new clause on VAT on which
all MPs could vote.
If the government thought it was in danger of losing this vote it might
consider saying that it regarded the issue as a matter of confidence in an
effort to turn the tables.
It is hard to see how the government could avoid abandoning the proposed
increase from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent if the vote nevertheless went
Labour's way, since it could not contemplate voting against the entire
finance bill at the third reading.
There is an outside chance the government might try to devise a way of
wording a subsequent confidence motion so as to override the enforced
U-turn. Government business managers indicated yesterday that this was
unlikely.
