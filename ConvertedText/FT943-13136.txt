   By REUTER


South African shares found late support to lift industrials off their lows,

The overall index added 31 at 5,579 as it found support from De Beers and
Anglos. The industrial index finished 2 firmer at 6,359 and the gold shares
index retrieved 18 at 2,113 following Tuesday's 61-point fall.
De Beers advanced R1.75 to R109.75 and Anglos R6 to R239 amid steady demand.
Minorco slipped 50 cents to R106.50 and Richemont managed a R1 gain to R38.
SAB climbed off a mid-afternoon low to close a net 25 cents down at R85.75
and Barlows firmed 25 cents to R31.75. Iscor continued to tread water at R4
after recent hefty gains, and Sasol improved 25 cents to R27.50.
