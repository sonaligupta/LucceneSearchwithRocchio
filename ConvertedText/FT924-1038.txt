FT  21 DEC 92 / Power 'duopoly' may face extra curb


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


PROFESSOR Stephen Little-child, the electricity regulator, is considering
whether the power generating companies should be regulated as electricity
distributors are.
The review comes amid mounting concern about the 'duopoly' exercised by
National Power and PowerGen, which together have more than 70 per cent of
the market.
Prof Littlechild has the power only to regulate prices charged by the
regional electricity companies, since they are considered local monopolies
and regulation is required to keep prices down. But because the generators
are supposed to compete to sell their electricity, they were exempted from
regulation.
Prof Littlechild has frequently criticised the market dominance of the
generators, most recently last week when, in a report on electricity prices,
he called for greater competition.
He has threatened the generating companies with a monopolies reference,
although an alternative would be to subject them to price regulation. Prof
Littlechild indicated last week that he was considering that option.
The generating companies have been accused of damaging the prospects for the
coal industry by failing to pass on all the benefits of falling coal prices.
National Power and PowerGen have denied that and will soon be discussing
pricing with Prof Littlechild.
