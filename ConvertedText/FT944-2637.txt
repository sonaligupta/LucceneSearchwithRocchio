FT  16 DEC 94 / Scots travel group makes foray south


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


Direct Holidays, the Glasgow-based direct-marketing holiday group backed by
the Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced its first foray into English
markets with a Pounds 1m investment in running cut-price flights and
holidays from Liverpool Airport.
The company is guaranteeing to undercut the brochure prices of any similar
holiday from Manchester Airport by 21 per cent.
It is tilting at big holiday companies such as Airtours and Thomson, which
run their own aircraft fleets from Manchester and have substantial
investment there in dedicated check-in facilities and aircraft maintenance.
Direct Holidays, founded in 1991 by three former directors of Owners Abroad,
works on the same principle as direct-marketing insurance companies -
cutting out agents, brokers and commission in a mainly telephone sales
operation. It claims to be Scotland's largest direct-sales holidays
business, with a 12 per cent share of the Scottish charter holidays market.
This year it has carried 70,000 passengers using Glasgow and Prestwick
airports, turning over about Pounds 15m. Mr John Boyle, one of the founders,
said current pre-tax profits were about Pounds 450,000 a year.
Liverpool Airport's struggle for growth in Manchester's shadow has provided
the company's first opportunity in England. Mr Boyle's research showed other
regional airports, such as Newcastle, well served by local operators, but
Liverpool had less holiday charter traffic than Exeter.
Two tour operators ceased trading yesterday.
The Civil Aviation Authority said Ultimate Holidays and Transamerica
Holidays were both covered by air travel organiser's licence bonds.
Ultimate Holidays took over Transamerica in July.
