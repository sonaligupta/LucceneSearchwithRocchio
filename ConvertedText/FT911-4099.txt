FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: Annuities find favour


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Falling interest rates and speculation about changes to tax laws in the
pipeline have caused an increase in demand for annuities from life insurance
companies, according to Baronworth Investment Services. The products are of
interest for people who want to increase income during retirement, but the
drawback is that payments normally stop on death.
According to Baronworth, the best annual payments on temporary annuities
lasting for nine years, assuming a down payment of Pounds 10,000, are Pounds
1,900.70 from Carlyle Life, and Pounds 1,890 from Scottish Equitable. On a
Pounds 10,000 immediate annuity, which guarantees to pay you annually until
your death, RNPF Nurses is offering Pounds 1,328.28 a year to people aged
60, and Scottish Equitable Pounds 1,308.
