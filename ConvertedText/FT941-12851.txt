FT  28 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Israel to buy 20 US jet fighters


   By JULIAN OZANNE and REUTER


   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON


Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said yesterday Israel had decided
to go-ahead with a deal worth up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to buy 20
specially adapted F-15E jet fighters from McDonnell-Douglas, the US aircraft
maker, writes Julian Ozanne from Jerusalem.
The decision ends a fierce two-year bidding war between McDonnell-Douglas
and Lockheed to supply Israel with its next-generation fighter. The cost of
an F-15E is estimated at around Dollars 100m each, although Israel has
apparently negotiated a substantial discount on the entire order.
Sweden has asked to buy 500 AIM-120 air-to-air missiles made by Raytheon and
the Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors for Dollars 465m (Pounds
310m), the Pentagon said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The
missiles would be used on the new Swedish JAS-39 Gripen multi-role military
jet.
