FT  21 JUL 94 / Observer: Hourglass figure


So much for Sweden's famed sexual libertarianism. Bjorn Rosengren has been
forced to quit as head of the country's white-
collar union, the Confederation of Professional Workers, following
revelations that he visited a topless club - three years ago.
Rosengren dropped in at the Tabu club along with an American guest, but says
he left - after less than an hour - when he realised what sort of
establishment it was.
Some hour. His bill was for SKr55,000, or Dollars 7,200, which even by
Scandinavia's expensive standards is pushing the boat out. His lawyer
managed to reduce the outlay to below SKr10,000. What sank Rosengren was the
outcry from his membership, 50 per cent of whom are women. Some taboos die
hard, it seems.
