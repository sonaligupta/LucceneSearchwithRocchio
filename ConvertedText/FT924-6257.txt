FT  21 NOV 92 / Castle embodies nation's heritage


WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the
sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years.
The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry
ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of
strongholds to control the area around London.
It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still
follows the shape of the original earthwork.
In 1215 King John rode reluctantly from the castle to nearby Runnymede to
set his seal on the Magna Carta.
Earlier, Henry I was the first monarch to make it a royal house when in 1121
he married his second wife Adelaide of Louvain in a chapel in the castle.
Their new home was little more than a cold and draughty timbered hall.
Each monarch in turn strengthened and added to the castle. The lower wall of
the dominant Round Tower dates back to Henry II, who reigned from 1154-89.
Two kings were born in the castle: Edward III (1327-77), and the gentle and
pious Henry Vl (1422-61), who founded Eton College. His body lies in the
castle's St George's Chapel.
Henry VIII (1509-47) made additions to St George's Chapel and his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), built a gallery which is now part of the
Royal Library.
Work on the inside of the castle was carried out by Sir Christopher Wren on
the command on Charles II (1660-85), although he was not often resident
there.
George III - 'Farmer George', who was king for 60 years from 1760 - loved
the whole of the Thames valley, and since then Windsor's popularity has
never wavered. Queen Victoria (1837-1901) loved the castle more and more as
she grew older.
The state apartments are open to the public when the Queen is not in
residence and visitors can view a collection of paintings by Holbein,
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Canaletto, as well as important
collections of furniture, porcelain and tapestries. Also on display are
drawings by old masters, including Leonardo da Vinci.
