FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting lifts DuPont
earnings in fourth quarter


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


Underlying earnings at DuPont in the final quarter of 1993 reflected the
steady improvement in the US chemicals company's operating position during
last year, rising to Dollars 329m from Dollars 97m the year before.
After-tax operating earnings rose by a quarter for the year as a whole, to
Dollars 1.7bn.
The gains were made largely as a result of cost-cutting, said Mr Edgar
Woolard, chairman, adding that the company would continue to concentrate on
productivity improvements to enable its businesses to grow at a faster rate
than the world economy.
Mr Woolard pointed in particular to improvements in the group's petroleum
business in the latest period, where cost-cutting on the upstream side and
higher margins on refining and marketing pushed operating income up to
Dollars 163m from Dollars 94m the year before.
The chemicals and other businesses also benefited from lower costs, he
added, though this was partly offset by weak economic conditions in Europe.
The chemicals business recorded operating income of Dollars 76m, up from
Dollars 51m a year before; fibres reported Dollars 104m, against Dollars
52m; polymers Dollars 85m, up from Dollars 26m; and diversified businesses
Dollars 4m, from a loss of Dollars 47m.
After previously-announced restructuring costs and other non-recurring
items, fourth quarter net income was Dollars 226m or 33 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 230m or 35 cents the year before.
One-off items included an after-tax charge of Dollars 144m to reflect
product liability claims, mainly related to the Benlate fungicide, offset by
a gain from the sale of Remington Arms and the company's Canadian
polyethylene business.
For the year as a whole, net income was Dollars 555m (Dollars 1.7bn before
all one-off items), against a loss of Dollars 3.9bn (a profit of Dollars
1.3bn before items) in 1992.
Cost-cutting also helped push earnings at chemicals group Union Carbide
ahead in the final quarter, lifting net income to Dollars 41m, or 26 cents a
share, from Dollars 17m, or 12 cents, the year before, when the results had
benefited from a net Dollars 7m gain from one-off items.
For the year, net income was Dollars 58m (Dollars 165m before accounting
changes), against a loss of Dollars 187m (a profit of Dollars 119m before
accounting changes and a contribution from discontinued operations) in 1992.
