FT  21 APR 94 / Japanese steel giant to halve investment

NKK, Japan's second largest steelmaker, plans to more than halve its capital
investment this year in an effort to cut costs and tide it over the
recession.
Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, meanwhile said it was testing
Korean-made steel, which is as much as 20 per cent cheaper than Japanese
steel, underscoring the growing rift in the traditionally strong business
ties Japanese companies have had with each other.
If Mitsubishi decided to use Korean steel, it would be the first Japanese
car company to do so on any scale in the domestic market.
NKK said that as part of its restructuring programme it would reduce capital
spending to Y63bn (Pounds 414.5m), or 52 per cent less than the Y130bn spent
last year.
The company, which expects to make a Y25bn loss in the year to March, is
planning to reduce capital spending by March 1997 to one-third of levels
seen in the past three years.
The move highlights the increasingly difficult trading environment facing
Japanese steelmakers, battered by falling demand at home, the strong yen and
increasing competition from cheaper, foreign-made steel.
The car industry provides as much as 20 per cent of overall steel demand in
Japan. Earlier this month, the main steelmakers were forced to agree price
cuts demanded by leading carmakers, for the first time in five years.
Mitsubishi emphasised that there was no change in its policy of maintaining
good relations with Japanese steelmakers. 'The high quality of Japanese cars
owes much to the technology development efforts of Japanese steelmakers,'
Mitsubishi said.
But Japanese carmakers themselves are under extreme pressure to reduce
costs.
Even if Mitsubishi in the end decides against using Korean steel, the
message will have been delivered - the recession has made vulnerable one
link that had seemed inviolable.
The US government yesterday upheld a preliminary ruling that Japanese makers
of grain-oriented electrical steel have been dumping their products in the
US market.
If the International Trade Commission decides that the practice is hurting
US business, Japanese steelmakers could face anti-dumping tariffs of up to
31.08 per cent.
