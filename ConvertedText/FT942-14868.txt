FT  19 APR 94 / Greek doctors begin stoppage


   By ASSOCIATED PRESS


   ATHENS


Greek doctors began a nationwide five-day strike yesterday in protest at the
government's decision to tax them under a new system which tells them how
much they earn and how much tax they should pay. They say that the system is
harsh on doctors earning less than the set level and soft on those earning
more. Doctors claim that the new system may lead to many giving up the
profession. Lawyers have been striking for the same reason for seven weeks,
leading to postponement of 60,000 court cases. Dentists plan a one-day
strike tomorrow, and truckers have announced an indefinite strike.
Parliament is to start debating the new tax system today and may vote by the
end of the week.
