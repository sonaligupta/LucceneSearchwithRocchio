FT  05 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Democrats to delay sale of
dairy boosting hormone


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


AMONG THE hundreds of provisions in the Democrat budget plan is a measure
promoted by Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, to delay the
sale of dairy output boosting hormone bovine somatotropin (BST) to US dairy
farmers.
The measure would ban the sale of BST for 90 days, if, as expected, the
synthetic hormone gets the blessings of the Food and Drug Administration
this year.
The entry of BST on to the market is expected to cost the US government
Dollars 15m in payments to dairy farmers, resulting from an over-supply of
milk.
An aide to the senator said the US Agriculture Department would, during the
90-day ban, conduct a study about the economic effects of BST. This would
give the senator time to find 'a legislative solution'.
The BST provision infuriated Senator John Danforth, a Missouri Republican,
in whose state is the headquarters of Monsanto, the group which has spent
Dollars 500m developing the product.
'This is a matter of principle in that it conveys such a very loud and clear
message to America's scientific community,' he said. 'What it says to the
scientific community is don't invest, don't play by the rules, because in
the end the politicians are lurking and the politicians will get you.'
