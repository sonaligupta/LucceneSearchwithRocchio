FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: London


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Friday's unexpectedly good inflation numbers and the news of a short-dated
gilt auction will have increased hopes of a base rate cut as trading resumes
this week.
According to Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International
(Europe), the inflation news, which saw the underlying rate falling to 2.4
per cent in March, fulfilled only one half of the conditions for a rate cut.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, will also want to see signs of a weakening recovery before
they agree to a cut.
Such signs could emerge this week, as analysts pore over Wednesday's
unemployment figures and Thursday's retail sales statistics. But the
chancellor may have a narrow window of opportunity to cut rates if he wants
to avoid being accused of a political move ahead of the May local, or June
European, elections.
The short-dated auction also prompted speculation about a rate cut.
Depending on timing, a cut would either boost the price of short-dated stock
which had already been issued, or allow the Bank to achieve a lower
financing cost.
Gilts seem to have steadied after the first quarter's falls. But a rally may
require more evidence that the latest inflation figures are not just
retrospective, but point to continued slow prices growth.
