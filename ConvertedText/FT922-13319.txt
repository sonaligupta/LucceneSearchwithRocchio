FT  13 APR 92 / HK governor urges early decision over successor


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


LORD WILSON, Hong Kong's outgoing governor, has urged Mr John Major, the
British premier, to make an early decision on his successor.
Lord Wilson said at the weekend that he hoped his replacement would be named
within the next few weeks and that the individual chosen would have
knowledge of China and Hong Kong.
Lord Wilson is expected to travel to London by the end of the month for
talks with Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.
The choice of governor is likely to be one of Mr Major's most difficult
appointments. The next occupant of government house is likely to be the
person who hands back the UK's last big colony to a communist regime. The
job is not seen to be for someone who wants a political career after 1997.
Senior colonial officials are adamant the appointment of a 'failed'
politician would be detrimental to Hong Kong. Persistent reports from London
that Dr David Owen, the former Labour foreign secretary and leader of the
Social Democrats, is a favourite for the post worries officials.
The job is demanding and requires a high degree of administrative skill. The
governor is one of the last true plenipotentiates; he presides over a civil
service of over 100,000 and possesses wide reserve powers.
In addition, since last September's elections in Hong Kong - which returned
18 democratically elected individuals to the 60 member Legislative Council -
politics in the colony has become more fractious and the government has come
under greater pressure to justify and explain its policies.
High on the agenda of a new governor will be how to incorporate some of the
democratically-elected politicians into his cabinet, or Executive Council.
Lord Wilson failed to do this, and it has cost his administration dear.
