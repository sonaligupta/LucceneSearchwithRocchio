FT  15 NOV 93 / Alfonsin backs Menem reform


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUNOS AIRES


PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina and former president Raul Alfonsn, new
leader of the main opposition Radical party, last night signed an agreement
opening the way for constitutional reform allowing Mr Menem to stand for
re-election, John Barham reports from Bunos Aires.
In the agreement between two bitter enemies, Mr Menem agreed to opposition
demands to call off a planned plebiscite on constitutional reform scheduled
for next Sunday. In return, Mr Alfonsn promised Radical backing for the
ruling Peronist party in a forthcoming congressional vote to amend the 1853
constitution.
