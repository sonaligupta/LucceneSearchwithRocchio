FT  13 MAR 92 / Assad assails west's curbs on weapons sales to Arabs

SYRIA'S President Hafez al-Assad yesterday bitterly criticised western
attempts to deny Arab countries advanced weaponry, while allowing Israel to
continue to develop its arsenal of modern weapons.
'That is not international legitimacy. That is the law of the jungle, the
law of wild animals,' Mr Assad said in a speech marking his swearing in as
president for a fourth term. Mr Assad also denied that a North Korean ship,
which docked earlier this week at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, was
carrying improved Scud-C missiles for Syria.
'These ships they are talking about are not carrying missiles to Syria,' he
declared. 'Everything you have heard is untrue.'
The US, which had come under intense pressure from Israel to stop the ship,
said it had eluded surveillance by hugging the Iranian coast. But it seems
more likely the US decided not to intercept the North Korean vessel to avoid
an international incident.
'If they want to limit arms, the Israeli factories which produce the nuclear
bomb, tanks, missiles and electronics should be closed,' he declared.
