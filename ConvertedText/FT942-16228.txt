FT  12 APR 94 / Mexican murder inquiry set back

The investigation into last month's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party, has received a setback after a judge freed an official
accused of helping plot the murder.
The judge on Sunday released Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official who
hired the security guards accused of aiding the assassin, on the grounds of
insufficient evidence. Mr Rivapalacio had been charged with indirect
involvement in the murder.
His arrest had led to speculation that an organised faction in the PRI was
behind the murder of Mr Colosio, and his release seems to hit hopes that the
government prosecutor will discover who, if anyone, ordered the
assassination.
The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to bring to trial Mr
Mario Aburto, the confessed assassin, along with three security guards at
the campaign rally in Tijuana where Mr Colosio was killed - Mr Vicente
Mayoral and his son Rodolfo, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez.
The three security guards were held on the basis of a video and photographs.
US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said yesterday he would visit
Mexico next month, Reuter reports.
