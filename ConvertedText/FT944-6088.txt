FT  30 NOV 94 / Imposters prey on business rate fears


   By JOHN AUTHERS


Bogus rating consultants are defrauding small businesses in the run-up to
next year's business rate revaluation, professional rating bodies said
yesterday.
Mr Colin Farrington, director of the Institute of Revenues, Rating and
Valuation, said unqualified people were setting themselves up as
'consultants', and in some cases 'absconding with clients' money'.
The institute says the Serious Fraud Office is investigating a company which
has ceased trading after taking Pounds 400,000 in advance fees. Trading
standards officers are investigating five or six companies who have
allegedly misrepresented their competence.
He said opportunities to 'leech' off companies were increased by the 'panic'
affecting businesses during evaluations. Some Pounds 7bn was raised from
business rates this financial year, and this total may increase after the
revaluation comes into force in April. The new rateable values will be
published in January.
