Digital Equipment has launched an aggressive bid to take the lead in the
fast-growing market for computer network 'servers', computers that boost the
performance of networks linking desktop computers.
Digital said its new 2100 servers, based on its Alpha Reduced Instruction
Set Computing (Risc) microprocessors, offered higher performance at half the
price of equivalent products from Sun Microsystems and International
Business Machines.
'Digital is breaking several performance and cost barriers,' said Mr William
Strecker, vice-president of engineering. 'We are bridging the worlds of
large-system features and small-system advantages to put the power to manage
complex tasks within the reach of enterprise departments and small
companies.'
The Digital 2100 server is the first in a family of Alpha Risc-based
departmental servers. Prices start at Dollars 18,900 for a single processor
unit.
