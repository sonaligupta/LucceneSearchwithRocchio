FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: E-II outlook uncertain as Icahn
again bids for assets

   NEW YORK


THE FUTURE of E-II, the bankrupt holding company which has become the
subject of a fierce tussle between two major creditors - Mr Carl Icahn, the
financier, and Mr Leon Black, a former Drexel Burnham Lambert banker -
remained unresolved late yesterday.
Court hearings to authorise a reorganisation plan put forward by the company
began yesterday with a debate on the advisability of a litigation settlement
involving E-II and McCrory, which was approved. McCrory, like E-II, was once
controlled by Mr Meshulum Riklis, another well-known US businessman. But
after a late start and lengthy adjournment, no decision over the central
issue - whether E-II's reorganisation plan should be approved by the court -
had been reached.
Mr Icahn, who owns 31 per cent of E-II's junior debt securities and is
opposing the company's reorganisation, again muddied the waters. He said
yesterday he was willing to bid for all E-II's operating assets.
Under this plan, the Culligan water treatment unit would be acquired by
Ametek, a quoted Pennsylvannia-based conglomerate, for Dollars 265m, while
Mr Icahn would bid for Samsonite, the luggage business, and McGregor. Mr
Icahn said his company, ACF, had placed Dollars 310m in escrow accounts
pending court action on the bids. Mr Icahn had previously offered Dollars
1.18bn in cash for the entire company.
