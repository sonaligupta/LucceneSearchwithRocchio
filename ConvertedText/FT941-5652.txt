FT  05 MAR 94 / Setback as Japan's surpluses rise again


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS

Hopes that Japan's current account and trade surpluses had peaked were
dashed yesterday when both recorded record highs in January.
The finance ministry announced that the country's balance of trade in goods
and services had increased by 30.9 per cent in dollar terms during January
compared with the same month last year.
In yen terms, the current account surplus increased for the first time in
six months, up 16.8 per cent to Y761.7bn.
The ministry attempted to play down the increase, pointing out that
January's figures tended to be volatile because of holidays and that there
had been an additional day of business this year.
The current account surplus reached a record Dollars 6.83bn before seasonal
adjustments. Exports rose 6.9 per cent to Dollars 25.36bn, while imports
increased only 3.3 per cent to Dollars 17.09bn. The surplus had fallen in
November last year by 20.6 per cent, but rose the following month.
Meanwhile, Japan's contentious trade surplus - excluding services - rose
15.1 per cent to a record Dollars 8.26bn during January. The figures were
inflated by the falling value of the dollar. However, the surplus widened
even in yen terms, up 2.7 per cent to Y921.5bn.
The upward trend continued during the first 20 days of February. The trade
surplus increased 1.4 per cent to Y731.2bn compared with the same period
last year, said the ministry. Exports fell 7.5 per cent to Y2,134bn, while
imports fell 11.5 per cent to Y1,402bn. In dollar terms the trade surplus
increased over the same period by 15.4 per cent to Dollars 6.674bn. Exports
rose 5 per cent to Dollars 19.4bn, while imports increased 0.3 per cent to
Dollars 12.7bn.
Presenting the government's budget yesterday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
Japanese prime minister, predicted the trade surplus would fall from
Y15,400bn (Pounds 98.1bn) to Y15,000bn. The current account surplus would
shrink, down from Y14,400bn to Y13,800bn, Mr Hosokawa said.
