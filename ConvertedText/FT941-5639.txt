FT  05 MAR 94 / Local newspapers look to multimedia as sales slip


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


The regional newspaper industry has launched its biggest study of multimedia
and the implications of electronic publishing for the future of newspapers.
Average circulation decline in the regional press has been 1 per cent to 2
per cent a year over the past 20 years and there are widespread worries
about the future of print.
The first stage of the project, organised by the Newspaper Society through
consultants Meta Generics, will scrutinise existing consumer and advertising
markets and assess the likely impact of technology in the next seven years.
A technical trial of electronic publishing concepts with a small number of
consumers may start next year to gauge interest in new services from
newspapers.
Mr Richard Beamish, director of development at the Newspaper Society, which
represents England's local and regional newspapers, has been looking at
research in the US and believes there are no magic solutions on offer.
'I think we are talking more about enhancing the product than producing a
different one,' he said.
Newspapers in the US already provide several thousand additional services -
either by audio or by fax - although at the moment these only account for
about 2 per cent of revenues. For instance, for a subscription of Dollars
2.95 a month readers can get five faxes a month providing more information
on chosen stories.
But Mr Brian Sallery, a director of Meta Generics, believes that as
competition from the electronic media intensifies the regional press may be
in a stronger position than national newspapers because it is 'more
targeted, more localised'.
