FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Canada bank expands in Chicago


   By LAURIE MORSE and BERNARD SIMON


   CHICAGO, TORONTO


Bank of Montreal has begun a long-planned expansion into the rapidly
consolidating Chicago banking market with the purchase of Suburban Bancorp.
The deal will merge Suburban, which has USDollars 1.3bn in assets, with Bank
of Montreal's Chicago subsidiary, Harris Bancorp, with assets of Dollars
13.5bn.
Under the agreement, Bank of Montreal will pay around Dollars 246m by
exchanging 3.93 of its own shares for each of Suburban's. Based on Friday's
closing markets, it will pay Dollars 73.08 a share for Suburban, or about 17
times 1994 earnings.
Suburban Bancorp owns 13 community banks in Chicago's suburbs, and the
majority of its stock is owned by members of the Gerald Fitzgerald family,
which has agreed to the sale.
The acquisition will boost the Chicago profile of Harris Bancorp, which has
banks in 42 locations and is the parent of Harris Bank, one of the five
largest banks in the city of Chicago.
The deal is the first big acquisition for Harris since the Bank of Montreal
a year ago unveiled plans to triple its Chicago subsidiary's earnings and
market share within a decade.
It is competing for acquisitions with large expansion-minded regional US
banks, which view Chicago as one of the largest and most profitable banking
markets in the country.
Bank of Montreal will file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington relating to the shares it will issue to pay for the
acquisition. A official said yesterday the bank would probably seek a
listing on a US stock exchange later this year.
All Canada's six big banks are eager to expand their operations in the US,
especially in the corporate market. So far, however, they have been
discouraged by the high prices demanded for acquisitions.
