FT  06 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


TECHNICAL trading between the futures and traded options arms of the Liffe
was behind a sharp fall in Footsie futures yesterday, writes Peter John.
Derivatives dealers said an early exercise of a large number of the August
2,850 and 2,900 FT-SE 100 call options prompted heavy selling of the Footsie
future for September.
As a result, September opened 15 down from the previous night's close and
traded even lower to hit 2,930, only a few points above the underlying cash
market.
When the technical position-taking was out of the way the futures began to
regain their lost ground. One analyst said: 'It was quite encouraging that
September picked up despite the selling pressure and the high level of the
market. It still feels quite firm.'
The September future was trading at 2,958 in after-hours' dealing,
comfortably above its estimated fair value premium to cash, which is
currently priced at around four points. However, turn-over was below 10,000
contracts, which is considered an average acceptable level.
Volume in traded options was boosted by some active business in Hanson. The
conglomerate was the top traded stock option with 4,339 lots transacted, and
most of the interest represented buying of call options. The bullish trade
prompted speculation of asset disposals within the company and drove the
underlying share price higher.
