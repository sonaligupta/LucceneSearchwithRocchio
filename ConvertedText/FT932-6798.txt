FT  27 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Challenge on EC banana imports upheld


   By REUTER


   GENEVA


A GATT disputes panel has ruled that the European Community's banana import
regime unfairly limits Latin American exports, trade sources said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Geneva.
The ruling was seen as a test case likely to encourage Latin American
nations to protest against a new EC quota scheme which sets even higher
tariffs on their bananas from July 1.
The panel recommended six EC member states remove their discriminatory
quotas and lower their tariff rates for Latin American producers to bring
them into line with those for other Gatt signatories, the sources said.
'The EC did lose,' said one trade source familiar with the report, which is
still confidential.
'The panel found two violations of Gatt provisions,' another said.
The report is also seen as a blow to African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries, which have enjoyed favourable access to some EC markets despite
their higher prices.
The 111 Gatt member states will be asked at a meeting of the ruling council
on June 16 to adopt the report formally.
The new regime will allow the annual import of 2m tonnes of bananas from
Latin America at a tariff of Dollars 117 (Pounds 75.90) a tonne. Shipments
over this limit will be charged at the rate of Dollars 995 a tonne - thereby
favouring ACP producers.
