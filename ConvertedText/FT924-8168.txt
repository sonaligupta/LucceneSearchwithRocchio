FT  12 NOV 92 / Matisse fetches Dollars 11m: Saleroom


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


A LATE painting by Henri Matisse depicting a young Asian girl with swirling
reds, purples and yellows, sold for Dollars 11m (Pounds 7.2m) at Sotheby's
New York on Tuesday night.
The painting, L'Asie, 1946, was bought by the Kimbell Art Museum of Fort
Worth, Texas. It was sold by the Estate of the late Mollie Livingston, who
designed clothes for the wives of several US presidents.
The price was comfortably above the Dollars 9m estimate. It was the first
time in two years that a work of art sold for more than Dollars 10m in the
US.
However, 31 of the 66 lots of Impressionist and Modern art on offer failed
to find buyers. The auction, which totalled Dollars 35.6m, was 38 per cent
unsold by value.
