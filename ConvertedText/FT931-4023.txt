FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Stora loses SKr1.36bn on poor
prices

STORA, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, said yesterday it was halving
its dividend to SKr6.50 per share after recording a SKr1.36bn (Dollars 179m)
loss after financial items in 1992.
Sharply lower prices were responsible for the deficit, which compares with a
SKr595m profit in 1991, after sales sagged to SKr46.9bn from SKr51.9bn.
'Price levels deteriorated sharply during the year because of overcapacity,
deregulation, the general recession and a turbulent currency market,' the
group said.
However, it was more upbeat about prospects for 1993, although it expects
weaker development in Europe due to reduced growth in Germany. It cited the
depreciation of the krona and the improving US economy as positive factors.
The big 1992 loss had been expected after Stora revealed preliminary figures
in January. The loss reflected one-off costs of SKr847m to cover further
restructuring. These costs were only partly offset by SKr375m in capital
gains.
The performance in the final four months of the year was particularly weak,
when the group struck an operating loss of SKr238m and a loss after
financial items of SKr979m.
Full-year sales fell SKr3.7bn, adjusted for divestments, with lower volumes
and prices for the building materials sector accounting for SKr1bn of the
decline. A further SKr3.3bn of the decline was attributed to lower prices
for forest products, although this was partially offset by increased
volumes, which added SKr700m.
Cost reductions of SKr2bn, following the group's extensive rationalisation
programme, ensured the deficit was not greater. The company reduced its
payroll by 4,100 employees in 1992 and is promising a further 2,500 job cuts
this year as part of a new SKr1.8bn savings programme.
Stora Feldmuhle reported an operating loss of SKr258m for the year, sharply
reversing the SKr915m profit recorded a year earlier. The group blamed a 20
per cent fall in newsprint prices and a 12 per cent fall in prices for
lightweight coated paper for the decline, even though demand for both
products increased.
Stora Cell, the pulp unit, recorded a deepened loss of SKr394m, against
SKr310m, following substantial one-off costs and the write-down of a
forestry project in Portugal.
Group investments fell to SKr2.43bn during the year from SKr3.38bn. The loss
per share amounted to SKr18.70, compared with income of SKr8.60 in 1991.
