FT  30 OCT 93 / Midland aims at small businesses


   By ALISON SMITH


MIDLAND BANK yesterday confirmed its intensified competition for small
business clients by announcing the freezing of its small-business tariff for
the coming year.
About 100,000 small businesses will continue to pay 60p for each credit and
debit item and a monthly maintenance charge of Pounds 2.50, the level they
have been since December 1990.
Charges have also been frozen for a further 200,000 on the standard business
tariff, which is no longer available to new customers.
The move reinforces the bank's high-profile advertising campaign which
emphasises that it has Pounds 1bn to invest in viable small businesses.
It comes at the end of a week in which Lloyds said it was cutting
transaction charges to small businesses and National Westminster announced a
slight increase in its tariff.
Banks should recognise their social obligations by not misusing their
economic power, by providing banking services to the entire community and by
acting to prevent unsustainable environmental practice, Bankwatch UK, the
research group, says.
Its report, published by the 'green' pressure group New Economics
Foundation, highlights the withdrawal of banks and building societies from
parts of Birmingham as an example of how banks have the power to 'pull the
plug' on a community.
