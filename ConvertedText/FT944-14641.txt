FT  21 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Most wool prices have moved up steadily this week. At the superfine Merino
end the market was a little erratic but below that increases predominated.
They only amounted to a few cents but this gradual strengthening is
preferred by the trade to the more dramatic increases which applied
particularly with finer Merinos earlier in the selling season. The Eastern
states market indicator in Australia closed at 762 cents a kg. 24 cents
higher than a week before, but well short of it's seasonal peak of 835
cents. The market recovery has occurred without special emphasis on China,
seen not only as the main international buyer but also as the best prospect
for growth. Confidence in wool stems from confidence in world economic
recovery, and major distortions either way would be unwelcome to the trade.
