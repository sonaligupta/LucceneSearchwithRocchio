FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rights bolsters Wassall advance


   By DAVID WIGHTON


Wassall, the conglomerate which lost the bid battle for Evode last year, saw
pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 17.8m to Pounds 27.6m in 1993 on sales up
11 per cent to Pounds 277.8m.
Profits were boosted by the Pounds 103m rights issue launched to fund the
thwarted Evode bid. But the issue diluted earnings per share which rose 23
per cent to 11.7p.
Mr Chris Miller, chief executive, said that earnings per share would have
been 11 per cent higher but for the rights issue, though they were lifted 8
per cent by exchange rate movements.
The loss of Evode, where Wassall was outbid by Laporte, has been followed by
further disappointments, including abortive talks with Fenner. 'We have got
quite close to a number of things but most failed for price-related
reasons,' said Mr Miller.
'We are as confident as you can be that there will be an acceptable deal in
the not too distant future,' he added.
Although Wassall is still viewed as an acquisition-driven group, Mr Miller
pointed to the strong organic growth shown by the 32 per cent increase in
operating profit to Pounds 27.2m. 'That suggests there is something we are
doing that is not straight asset-stripping.'
He said the improvement was 'particularly satisfactory' given that most of
its markets outside the US experienced little or no recovery last year.
Even in the US, its DIY products supplier DAP has had to work hard to
increase sales and most of the advance came from higher margins. Its
operating profits rose from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 13.7m, on sales Pounds
20.7m higher at Pounds 146.7m.
Metal Closures, the bottle top manufacturer which was the group's first
large acquisition, continued to make good progress. The South African arm,
which contributes nearly 30 per cent of group profits, had an 'excellent'
year in difficult conditions and the division's profits rose to Pounds 12.2m
(Pounds 9.3m) on sales of Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 76.6m).
A final dividend of 2.4p gives a total up 36 per cent at 3.4p (2.5p).
COMMENT
It may be that the ex-Hanson men who run Wassall are just too choosy when it
comes to buying companies. But then they can afford to be. Their past
acquisitions are still generating the sort of improvements that most
'growth' companies would kill for. Perhaps most remarkable of all is the
progress of Metal Closures' South African business, where profits have risen
from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 8m since Wassall bought the company in 1990. This
exposure may unsettle the nervous, though Mr Miller points out things would
have to get pretty bad to hit sales of bottle tops. The real worry is
Wassall's inability to find an earnings enhancing acquisition despite the
low returns on its cash pile. Without some action before long, the shares'
deservedly high rating will be hard to sustain. On current year forecasts of
about Pounds 31.5m the shares at 295p, up 10p, are on a multiple of over 22.
