FT  12 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Labour shortage delays rubber
tapping


   By REUTER


   KUALA LUMPUR


About 540,000 hectares of rubber trees on Malaysian smallholdings are still
untapped, mainly because of a shortage of workers, the Rubber Industry
Smallholders Development Authority said, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Shahabuddin Shafie, the authority's director-general, was quoted by a
local newspaper as saying that the figure accounted for 30 per cent of the
1.8m rubber trees in Malaysia.
'The industry is facing a serious shortage and that is why the trees have
been left untapped,' he said. 'People prefer to work in factories than in
rubber smallholdings and if left unchecked (this) will affect the rubber
output.'
Malaysia's rubber output fell to 1.07m tonnes in 1993 from 1.17m tonnes in
1992.
The country's central bank, in its 1993 annual report, said that production
in the smallholding sectors, which contributed to 70 per cent of the
country's output, declined by 3.5 per cent in 1993 to 851,800 tonnes.
The authority is looking into ways of curing the labour shortages in the
country's rubber industry. 'This will include increasing the wages of rubber
tappers to as competitive as those in the construction or the industrial
sectors,' Mr Shahabuddin said.
