FT  28 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Urenco enters Japanese market

URENCO, the uranium enrichment consortium linking British Nuclear Fuels with
German and Dutch partners, has broken into the Japanese market. Tokyo
Electric Power Company (Tepco) has awarded Urenco a long-term contract
expected to be worth at least Dollars 300m (Pounds 157m) over 10 years.
Tepco said that because there were few international providers of enriched
uranium, it had decided to widen its sourcing in order to ensure that its
needs were met. As the country's biggest electric utility, Tepco's choice of
Urenco is thought likely to prompt other Japanese regional power companies
to follow suit.
Japan is now one of the few countries with a clear policy to expand nuclear
generating capacity. Its needs for enriched uranium are currently met by the
US, through the Energy Department in Washington, and by the French-led
Eurodif. Tepco said the contract, from 1995 to 1996, had passed all
approvals required by the Ministry for International Trade and Industry.
Urenco is to supply two boiling water reactors which Tepco is building in
Niigata Prefecture.
Mr JA Paleit, Urenco managing director, said the enrichment work would be
carried out by all three of the consortium's partners: British Nuclear
Fuels, Uranit of Germany and Ultra-Centrifuge of the Netherlands. It is
likely to add at least 10 per cent to Urenco's turnover in the late 1990s.
