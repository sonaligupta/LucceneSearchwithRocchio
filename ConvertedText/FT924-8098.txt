FT  13 NOV 92 / Painting by Matisse fetches record Dollars 14.5m: Saleroom


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


HENRI Matisse's 'Harmony in Yellow', a domestic interior, showing his model
Zita asleep at a table, sold for Dollars 14.52m. (Pounds 9.6m) at Christie's
in New York on Wednesday night.
The price was an auction record for the artist, exceeding the Dollars 12.4m
paid in 1989 at the height of the art-market boom.
Matisse painted the work in Nice in 1928 and it has been in a private
collection since the early 1930s. It was modestly estimated at up to Dollars
7m and proved the highlight of an exceptional auction.
The sale totalled Dollars 70.6m with 59 of the 76 lots sold. Just 9 per cent
by value was unsold. The total was within Christie's expectations and
suggested that its policy of modest estimates and selective choice of art
tempted US private buyers. The auction was the best in the market for
Impressionist and Modern paintings for more than two years and did much
better than Sotheby's sale on Tuesday which was 38 per cent unsold. One of
Monet's few fully completed versions of water lilies, painted when he was
78, sold for Dollars 12.1m - comfortably above estimate. 'Two Dancers in
Green Dresses' by Degas also sold well, at Dollars 7.156m, to a private
European collector. Another Monet, a view of Venice, made just over Dollars
3m.
All 24 pictures from the collection of the late Dorothy Rodgers, widow of
the composer Richard Rodgers, were sold, confirming the appeal of paintings
fresh to the market. The top price in this group was the Dollars 2.2m paid
for 'Guitar and Newspaper' by Picasso, although this was below estimate.
In London yesterday 'The Antique Juggling Girl', one of the few full-length
nudes painted by Lord Leighton, sold at Sotheby's for Pounds 440,000, at its
low estimate. It was the top lot in an auction of Victorian pictures which
made Pounds 1.7m but was 30 per cent unsold.
