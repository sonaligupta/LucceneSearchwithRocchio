FT  13 APR 94 / Walesa approves budget


   By REUTER


   WARSAW


President Lech Walesa yesterday signed into law Poland's 1994 budget, ending
weeks of speculation that he might veto it to show his disaffection with the
left-wing government. He signed the law two days before the Paris Club of
government creditors decides whether Poland has met all the conditions for
completion of a 50 per cent reduction of its official foreign debt under a
1991 agreement. The Paris Club is expected to clear the final 20 per cent
tranche of the agreement struck when Poland's official debt was about
Dollars 35bn (Pounds 23.9bn). The budget envisages a deficit of 83,000bn
zlotys (Pounds 2.5bn), equivalent to about 4.1 per cent of gross domestic
product and a limit acceptable to international financial institutions. It
also allows for a 4.5 per cent increase in GDP this year and annual
inflation of 23 per cent, compared with more than 37 per cent in 1993.
