FT  26 OCT 92 / Labour's tactics kept under wraps


   By ALISON SMITH


MYSTERY and suspense are clearly Labour's tactics as the Commons nears
confrontation on the Maastricht treaty - whatever their tactics at the end
of that debate to pave the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill.
The Opposition decided last week that they would not give government whips
the comfort of being able to work on the basis of a known Labour stance.
That position was complicated slightly at the weekend with speculation that
the government might turn the issue into a matter of confidence. Mr John
Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday that if the motion was
one of confidence, it would be Labour's job to vote against it.
Amid those uncertainties, the shadow cabinet will discuss tactics at its
regular meeting on Wednesday.
Labour has a delicate task of balancing its views on Europe with its job in
the House, both in how it votes on the government motion and how it
expresses its views.
One option is that Labour could put down an amendment that simply regretted
that the government was proceeding with the Maastricht Bill before Denmark's
position on ratification was clear.
Such an amendment might appeal to some Tory Euro-sceptics, but it might also
make Labour more vulnerable to Tory charges of reneging on its commitment to
Europe.
Alternatively, it could put down an amendment expressing its broadly
pro-European stance and deploring once again the absence of the social
chapter from the version of the treaty agreed by the UK. That would deny it
any prospect of Tory rebel support on that particular vote, but would put
its position clearly on the record.
