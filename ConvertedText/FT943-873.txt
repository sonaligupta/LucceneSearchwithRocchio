FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Discounting helps T&S to Pounds 7m


   By PETER PEARSE


T&S Stores, the confectionery, tobacco and news retailer and convenience
store operator, lifted pre-tax profits by 3 per cent from Pounds 6.79m to
Pounds 7.02m in the 26 weeks to July 2.
Operating profits, before losses from business disposals of Pounds 212,000
(Pounds 88,000 profit) grew more strongly. They showed an 11 per cent
increase to Pounds 7.62m (Pounds 6.85m).
Turnover was 17 per cent ahead at Pounds 201m (Pounds 171m).
The shares edged up 2p to close at 182p.
Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, said he was 'happy' with the results. They
were achieved in a mature market and in spite of declines in cigarette
volumes.
He said that although the UK confectionery market was up 2 per cent over
last time, the grocery market was 'flat or slightly down', and the news
market was down in the wake of the price war in newspapers and magazines.
In February the group bought the 74-store Gibbs Newsagents chain for Pounds
7.1m including expenses and in March it acquired 23 Macs convenience stores
for a total of Pounds 6m.
These contributed Pounds 399,000 to profits and Pounds 10.7m to turnover.
By division, Supercigs, the core high-street 'deep discounter' chain, raised
profits 22 per cent to Pounds 2.96m on turnover up 5 per cent at Pounds 87m.
The rise was fuelled by multi-buy discounts and discounts on everything in
the stores - even news in 125 of the 217 stores.
Average branch profits rose 18 per cent.
Profits in the 336-strong CTNs chain advanced by 20 per cent to Pounds
3.97m, mostly as a result of the Gibbs acquisition. Turnover grew 24 per
cent to Pounds 63.3m, with like-for-like sales edging up 3 per cent.
The C stores format showed the strongest organic gains.
Here, profits rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 3m with only a small
contribution from Macs. Turnover was 36 per cent ahead at Pounds 50.7m. Like
for like sales rose 9 per cent. Ten extra stores were opened.
The interim goes up to 2.6p (2.5p), payable from earnings of 7.27p (7.06p)
per share.
