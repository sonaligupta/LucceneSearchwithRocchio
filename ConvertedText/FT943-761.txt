FT  28 SEP 94 / Travellers face extra checks


   By STEWART DALBY


Germany and France have become the first European countries to introduce
extra health checks on travellers from India, where an outbreak of pneumonic
plague has killed at least 43 people.
Other European countries, including Britain and the Netherlands, said they
saw no reason for tighter controls yet. In London, the Immigration
Department at the Home Office said: 'The Department of Health has decided
that current procedures at Heathrow Airport are adequate and no extra checks
are necessary for the moment.'
The decision by Germany and France follows new measures by Hong Kong,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Thailand, some Gulf states and South Korea. Many Asian
countries have a large number of Indian expatriate workers.
A Frankfurt airport spokesman said last night that doctors had boarded early
morning flights from India and checked passengers for symptoms of fever. All
other flights from India would be monitored.
France began conducting special medical examinations at the main Paris
airports over the weekend. The French health ministry said disinfectant
measures on flights from plague-affected areas had been stepped up.
The six Gulf states - UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar -
have decided to screen all passengers arriving from India.
The US yesterday warned arriving travellers to see a doctor if they develop
symptoms. 'Plague alert notices' are being handed to airline passengers
arriving directly from India.
