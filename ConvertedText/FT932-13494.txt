FT  23 APR 93 / Company steps out of Merck price line


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


PROPOSALS by Merck, the largest US drugs group, on how the industry should
respond to political pressure over pricing, were rejected yesterday by
another company, Warner-Lambert.
Merck's chief executive, Mr Roy Vagelos, has proposed limiting price
increases on all prescription products to the rate of inflation plus 1 per
cent. He suggested drugs groups should sign contracts with the government
and pay revenues from excess price increases to improve access to health
care.
Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Amgen and Schering-Plough have all adopted the plan.
However, Mr Melvin Goodes, Warner-Lambert's chief executive, has refused.
'This is not an industry proposal. It's a Merck proposal,' he said.
Price controls did not work, he claimed, and he believed the Clinton
administration would not implement them.
The announcement exposes a split in the US drugs industry over how to
respond to increasing political attacks on its pricing policies. During the
late 1980s, many groups incapable of driving volume growth compensated by
increasing prices.
Warner-Lambert is a classic example of a struggling pharmaceuticals group,
according to analysts. Most of its recent historic growth has been generated
by price increases.
Its main volume-growing product, Lopid, a cholesterol lowering product, has
been hit in recent months by price competition. Earnings are being driven
mainly through rationalisation. Mr Goodes forecast 7-8 per cent sales growth
this year.
So far, 13 companies, including Upjohn, Eli Lilly, Lederle and Syntex, have
agreed to limit price increases, on average, to the rate of inflation. This
allows them to raise some prices more than the rate of inflation, and while
cutting others.
