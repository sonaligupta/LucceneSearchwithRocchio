FT  13 NOV 92 / Irish poll shows fall in PM's popularity

MR Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has suffered a new blow to his
re-election hopes with the publication of the latest nationwide opinion poll
showing a sharp drop in support for his Fianna Fail party and his own
personal popularity hitting a new low.
The poll published yesterday in the Irish Times, carried out by the Market
Research Bureau of Ireland, shows support for Fianna Fail down from 49 per
cent to 40 per cent over the past six weeks, and Mr Reynolds' leadership
rating down from 60 per cent of voters satisfied to 31 per cent.
The poll was conducted last Monday. It remains to be seen whether a IPounds
1bn (Dollars 1.6bn) spending package announced by Fianna Fail this week, as
part of its manifesto, will enable it to turn the tide.
Mr Reynolds has staked his political future on winning an absolute majority
in the November 25 general election, but will require at least 47 per cent
of the vote to do so.
The poll also indicates that the majority of the electorate did not think a
general election was necessary, and that most believe Mr Reynolds was
responsible for precipitating it, in the 'feud of honour' with his coalition
partners.
