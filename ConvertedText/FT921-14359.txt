FT  16 JAN 92 / FIS leader urges non-violence


   By REUTER


   ALGIERS


Mr Abdelkader Hachani, the FIS leader, told followers yesterday not to clash
with the army, saying they could achieve an Islamic state without violence
in spite of the scrapping of this week's parliamentary election, Reuter
reports from Algiers.
Mr Hachani said a junta had staged a coup d'etat but predicted the army
would split if ordered to move against the people. 'Confrontation with the
army will lead to the break-up of the armed forces, which are one of the
Algerian people's achievements.' He appealed to the army not to act as a
'strike force for the junta' and he vowed to pursue his struggle through
peaceful means.
'We will arrive at the Islamic state progressively, without concessions. . .
with wisdom and political legality,' he added.
