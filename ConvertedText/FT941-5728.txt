FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Amic steps up dividend after
strong advance


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic) is increasing its dividend for
the first time since 1989 following a sharp increase in profits.
The industrial arm of Anglo American of South Africa, reported an
unexpectedly robust performance in the year to December 31 amid growing
signs of recovery in its domestic and overseas markets.
The company, whose interests range from chemicals to mining equipment,
stainless steel and consumer goods, recorded a 37 per cent jump in pre-tax
profit to R647m (Dollars 187m) from R470m, on turnover a third higher at
R8.79bn against R6.78bn.
The dividend is increased by 7 per cent to 375 cents a share, from 350
centsin 1992. Shareholders have been offered a scrip alternative.
A large part of the improved sales reflected an increased shareholding in
construction subsidiary LTA. A similar boost is expected in 1994 from an
enlarged stake in chemicals supplier AECI.
The group's three major unlisted subsidiaries - Scaw Metals, the pulp and
paper producer Mondi, and mining equipment supplier Boart - all reported a
strong turnround in their main markets in the second half of 1993, with
further signs of good domestic and export orders so far thisyear.
Net income before abnormal items was up by more than a fifth at R526m,
against R354m. Deferred tax credits boosted the bottom line by another R90m.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said the South African economy was heading for
growth of at least 4 per cent in 1994.
Amic has completed an internal reorganisation to improve financial
efficiency and borrowing capacity by maximising the tax base of its
wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Mr Boyd said Amic was embarking on a drive to attract international
partners, mainly for new business ventures.
In the past year, AECI established a joint venture in explosives with ICI of
the UK and entered a partnership with Daewoo, the Korean conglomerate, which
is investigating the construction of a R600m colour television tube plant in
South Africa.
