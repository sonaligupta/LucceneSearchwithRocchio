FT  12 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Utility sectors switch


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


UTILITIES attracted exceptionally heavy trading, with the regional
electricity (recs) and water stocks chased higher during the early part of
the session before the former came off sharply after Hoare Govett reiterated
its recommendation to switch from the recs to water shares.
The latter maintained Tuesday's late upsurge and closed with sharp gains
across the board as analysts adopted the view that the latest Ofwat
consultative paper contained nothing untoward for the sector. 'Institutions
are looking for dividend growth and security and the water sector delivers
on both of these categories,' said one specialist.
The market also responded to the relatively good figures released on Tuesday
by Anglian Water, which showed profits at the very top end of expectations
and a satisfactory 7.8 per cent increase in the interim payment.
Anglian, Hoare Govett's prime selection in the sector, ran up 15 to 494p,
while Northumbrian advanced 19 to 562p, Southern 14 to 476p and Thames 9 to
512p.
The recs were broadly lower after Hoare's switch recommendation, which
impacted mostly on Southern Electricity. The latter settled 12 off at 416p
after shifting its ex-dividend date from November 30 to January 1, a move
which prompted substantial selling by income funds.
The Scottish generators were heavily bought, with BZW said to have
emphasised their immunity from the Heseltine energy review and their
attraction following the expected British Coal deal. Scottish Hydro-Electric
and Scottish Power added 7 apiece at 235p and 215p respectively.
Glaxo easier
Two large lines of stock on offer contributed to weakness in Glaxo, which
was also marked down ahead of figures from Swedish pharmaceutical company
Astra. The Astra figures were expected to show an improved performance from
anti-ulcer drug Losec, which would suggest erosion of Glaxo's key product
Zantac. In the event they were strong but in line with forecasts.
However, there was pressure from the two blocks, of around 1m Glaxo shares
apiece, that were being sold at the bid price of 812p. Although the stock
did not recover its early fall, it held against a sliding market and closed
13 down at 813p with 5.4m traded.
Coats supported
Textile group Coats Viyella was firm as analysts returned from a company
visit to the US in enthusiastic spirits. The shares picked up 3 to 212p,
with BZW and UBS Phillips & Drew reinforcing their buy stance on the stock.
Ms Julia Blake, BZW's textile analyst said: 'There was considerable
reassurance in terms of forecasts and the strategy and speed of the
integration with Tootal. It was good solid stuff, which settled people's
nerves.' However, she cautioned that after running up on currency benefits
and the US visit the shares were nearing the top of their trading range.
The placing of 80m new shares in HSBC Holdings, raising some Pounds 480m,
was said by dealers to have gone smoothly, with all the shares taken up
'within minutes' and the whole issue substantially oversubscribed.
HSBC shares opened higher at 570p but came off sharply to trade at 560p as
the placing got under way, before stabilising and then moving up again to
close a net 4 firmer at 565p.
The big placing of HSBC shares triggered wholesale selling of the other UK
banks to enable institutions to pick up cheap stock in HSBC. National
Westminster fell 12 to 389p on turnover of 5.2m, Barclays 8 to 360p and
Lloyds 11 to 484p.
Merchant bank Hambros emulated SG Warburg in reporting disappointing interim
figures. Hambros shares fell sharply, touching 224p, before rallying after
what was described as a positive post-results meeting with analysts to end
the session 9 off at 235p. Kleinwort Benson dipped 5 to 289p with turnover
boosted by an agency cross of 535,000 shares at 285p.
Shares in the London discount houses burst into life as dealers anticipated
a cut in UK interest rates of a full percentage point. The sector was
additionally boosted by the encouraging statement from King & Shaxson, one
of the smallest of the discount houses.
K & S increased its interim dividend by 60 per cent and reported that in the
half-year to end-October it had made 'excellent profits', as opposed to a
small profit in the same period last year, deriving great benefit from
falling interest rates. The stock jumped 32 per cent, closing 21 ahead at
87p.
Cater Allen, scheduled to announce interims on November 19, advanced 22 to
370p, Gerrard & National 10 to 339p and Union Discount 7 to 61p.
The absence of the much rumoured bearish news on Lasmo saw the market shrug
off the effects of the recent spate of bear raids and lift the shares 5 1/2
to 160 1/2 p.
Turnover in the stock expanded strongly, eventually reaching a very heavy
16m shares, the largest single day's business since September 1988.
The shares were helped by a number of recommendations from broking houses,
notably from Hoare Govett, whose oil team told clients to switch out of
Enterprise Oil and into Lasmo because the 'massive disparity between the two
stocks is both unjustified and unsustainable'. Enterprise eased to 447p.
Calor dipped 3 to 225p after an agency cross of 1.3m shares executed at
220p.
Paper group Bowater firmed a penny to 452p as the shares attracted interest
following Monday's one-for-one share split.
Cable and Wireless's deal with BCE, of Canada, was greeted with enthusiasm
and saw C and W shares move forward 9 to 658p.
Rumours of an imminent dawn raid lifted Tarmac 2 to 96p. Taylor Woodrow fell
7 1/2 to 67 1/2 p after Hoare Govett increased its forecast of losses in the
current year.
Amersham International performed very well on good results and the
realisation that profits for the year to March 1994 would receive a big
boost from currency changes. Hoare Govett increased its forecast for 1994 to
Pounds 37m from Pounds 32.9m. The shares climbed 29 to 555p.
Courtaulds had been looking oversold and recovered 4 to 503p ahead of
results expected next week.
A large line of stock was said to have unhinged Asociated British Foods,
leaving it down 14 at 421p. More heavy two-way business in ASDA saw 21m
traded but with little effect on the share price, which edged forward  1/4
to 47 3/4 p.
Switching fromn J. Sainsbury, down 13 at 479p, and into Argyll lifted the
latter to within a penny of its all-time high. It ended at 370p, up 2 on the
day.
Nervousness ahead of today's half-time results held back Boots. Analysts
said potential black holes included the US drugs market, the domestic DIY
business and the impact of a price war in perfumes. The shares slipped 5 to
497p.
Vickers eased 2 to 79p after Smith New Court bought and sold a block of 4m
shares at around 77p.
Motor trader Jessup forged ahead 10 to 65p as the company announced
full-year figures back in the black and an upbeat trading statement.
Rothmans International weakened 18 to 595p in reaction to a BZW profits
forecast downgrading and depressed also by slightly lower profits from
Dunhill Holdings, in which Rothmans has a 58 per cent share stake. BZW cut
its 1992-93 profits forecast to Pounds 592m from Pounds 605m and to Pounds
667m from Pounds 675m for 1993-94 as a result of weak results from Rothmans'
Australian operations. Dunhill closed the session 9 lighter at 384p.
