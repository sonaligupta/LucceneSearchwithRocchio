FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical advances 38%

Dow Chemical said higher sales volume and improved productivity had paid off
in a 38 per cent jump in first-quarter earnings, excluding special items.
The US basic and specialty chemical producer yesterday posted revenues of
Dollars 4.5bn for the quarter , a 4 per cent rise on the year-earlier result
of Dollars 4.36bn.
The gain was struck on an 8 per cent increase in sales volume, reflecting
the moderate expansion of the US economy and the beginning of an upturn in
European markets. But prices remained under pressure amid a capacity glut
within the world chemical industry.
An off-setting factor was the group's extensive streamlining efforts, which
resulted in further productivity gains. Cost-cutting in the quarter saved
Dollars 40m in research, promotion and administrative expenses, following an
estimated Dollars 100m in savings in 1993.
The net effect of higher volumes and lower costs was best highlighted by
Dow's plastics business. Sales of Dollars 1.6bn were unchanged from the 1993
period, but operating income surged 85 per cent to Dollars 161m.
The overall result was a bottom line figure of Dollars 173m, or 62 cents a
share, after a provision of 3 cents a share related to a fall in the value
of a short-term investment portfolio.
The group realised net income of Dollars 402m, or Dollars 1.47, in the first
quarter of last year, but the figure was bolstered by a one-time Dollars 1 a
share from the sale of the 50 per cent interest in Dowell Schlumberger, an
oil-field services group.
The consumer specialties division, including pharmaceuticals, agricultural
supplies and household products, turned in the most buoyant performance.
Sales were up 16 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn and income 52 per cent ahead at
Dollars 246m.
The hydrocarbons and energy division showed a 9 per cent sales improvement
and narrowed its operating loss to Dollars 1m, from Dollars 7m a year ago.
Sales of chemicals and performance products slipped 7 per cent to Dollars
1bn. Operating income slumped 25 per cent to Dollars 109m.
