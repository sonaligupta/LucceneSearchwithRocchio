FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervousness distorts new
aluminium contract


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


   A PREMIUM for nearby metal over metal for forward delivery


known as a backwardation - has developed in the London Metal Exchange's new
aluminium alloy contract because of market nervousness over the fact that
there is no metal yet in LME warehouses, an LME seminar was told in London
yesterday.
Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME aluminium alloy committee, said the
backwardation (Dollars 15 a tonne between January 6 and 20) reflected the
lack of cash trading in the contract, which does not begin until January 6.
He did not expect the backwardation to last much beyond then.
The aluminium alloy contract, launched on October 6, is trading about 600
tonnes a day, with open interest at 13,740 tonnes. 'I consider this
extremely healthy,' said Mr Kestenbaum, who believes that trading volume
will increase once cash trading begins. But he said it would be four or five
years before the contract could be considered mature.
He did not doubt that it would be successful, pointing out that the amount
of aluminium scrap produced in the US alone was set to rise from the present
2.7m tonnes to 3.6m tonnes by the turn of the century. 'For much of this
tonnage the primary aluminium contract is a rotten hedge,' he said, but the
industry could make increasing use of the aluminium alloy contract.
'This particular industry is in its infancy and that is why this was the
right moment to introduce this contract,' Mr Kestenbaum told the seminar.
Western nickel stocks, at about 16 weeks consumption, are not substantial,
Mr Vivian Davies of Brandeis (Brokers) told the seminar. Producer stocks are
between 110,000 and 115,000 tonnes and merchant stocks at 30,000 tonnes. LME
warehouse stocks are a record 53,706 tonnes, much of it from the CIS, which
is expected to export 115,000 tonnes this year, of which 30,000 tonnes will
come through unofficial channels. But, Mr Davies pointed out, in 1975 Inco,
the world's biggest nickel producer, alone had stocks of 165,000 tonnes.
Mr Martin Abbott, LME marketing director, said the surge in options on the
exchange from 5 to 12 per cent of total turnover in the last 18 months was
'entirely logical' in a period of great uncertainty in the market. He denied
that there was anything suspicious about the development.
