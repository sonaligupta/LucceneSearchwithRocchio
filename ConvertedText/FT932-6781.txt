   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


US OFFICIALS yesterday offered an olive branch to North Korea ahead of next
week's talks at the United Nations on North Korea's withdrawal from the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
Mr Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of state for political-military
affairs, told a Senate committee yesterday that the US would be willing to
consider improved economic and political links if North Korea allowed
international nuclear inspectors into its reactor and nuclear fuel
processing plant at Yongban.
Mr Gallucci said the US was also prepared to address North Korean concerns.
