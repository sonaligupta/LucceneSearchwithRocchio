FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown makes Scottish disposal


Hillsdown Holdings' subsidiary FMC has sold its abattoir and consumer ready
meat operation at Perth, Scotland, to a subsidiary of Beck Food Group.
Consideration was a sum not material in relation to Hillsdown's net assets.
The sale of the Perth plant virtually completes the FMC disposal programme.
