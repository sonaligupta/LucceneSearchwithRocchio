FT  28 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Wako Securities considers
sale of some shareholdings


   By EMIKO TERAZONO and REUTER


   TOKYO


WAKO Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker, is considering selling some
of its stock portfolio, including bank cross-shareholdings.
The slump in the Tokyo market is severly hurting Japanese brokers. Several
brokerage houses, including Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko
Securities and Yamaichi Securities have announced cost-cutting programmes.
Wako is the first to admit it would sell cross-shareholdings, mainly of
banks.
A loosening of cross-shareholding relationships among Japanese companies
became apparent last April, when bank shares plunged on the Tokyo stock
market.
Wako said it would try to avoid releasing shares in a way that would depress
prices further.
Second-tier brokers expanded aggressively at the height of the bull market
in the late 1980s but they face losses as commission revenue has fallen due
to low market turnover.
Mr Brian Waterhouse, financial analyst at James Capel in Tokyo, said the
sale of cross-held shares was one of several painful options for brokers,
though he doubted this would have much impact as the volume of shares
involved was relatively small.
NKK Corp, Japan's second largest steel manufacturer, is to issue Y60bn
(Dollars 480m) in Eurobonds through public placements, Reuter reports.
Yamaichi International (Europe) will lead manage a Y20bn issue due in
November 1999. The issue will carry a 6.1 per cent coupon priced at
Y101.845. Signing is on August 4 and payment date is August 14. The other
Y40bn of bonds are due in November 2002 and carry a 6.2 per cent coupon
priced at Y101.825. Nikko Europe is lead manager.
