FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Hartons may receive full offer


Hartons Group said yesterday that discussions being held between two of its
main shareholders and a third party may result in a full offer being
launched for the distributor of semi-finished plastics.
If a deal were struck, at an intimated price of 8p per ordinary share and
60p per 7 per cent convertible cumulative redeemable preference share, the
purchaser would hold more than 30 per cent of the issued voting capital,
triggering a bid under the Takeover Code.
The shares rose 1p to 7p yesterday, valuing the group - which has incurred
losses in the past four years - at Pounds 5.2m.
