FT  19 MAY 92 / Argentine tax offensive targets flight capital


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


ARGENTINA'S tax inspectors yesterday began hauling in for questioning more
than 1,000 suspected owners of luxury yachts and holiday homes in Uruguay,
Brazil, Spain, the US and France.
The offensive against the rich is part of a successful campaign against tax
evasion by the 5,000 inspectors of the tax department, or DGI - known as the
Untouchables.
The wealthy have so far evaded the tax dragnet. They are the principal
holders of an estimated Dollars 40bn-Dollars 50bn (Pounds 22bn-Pounds 27bn)
in flight capital, which includes billions of dollars-worth of foreign
property, estimated at about Dollars 2bn in Uruguay alone. Mr Domingo
Cavallo, economy minister, wants them to pay taxes on the assets and 'begin
repatriating their wealth'.
Unofficial estimates indicate that attempts to encourage the return of
flight capital have so far been disappointing.
If the latest move is successful, the extra taxes will be used to finance
small companies and bolster the social security fund. Those complying will
be given an amnesty on any tax offences committed up to April 1.
Tax dodging was once part of the Argentine way of life. That changed when Mr
Cavallo took up his post last year and ordered a crack down. This, combined
with economic recovery, increased tax revenues to Dollars 1.84bn in April,
against Dollars 1.03bn a year earlier.
