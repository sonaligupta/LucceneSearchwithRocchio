FT  15 JUN 93 / Super-union for Romania


   By VIRGINIA MARSH


   BUCHAREST


TWO OF Romania's largest trade unions have merged to form a single union
with 3.7m members, one-third of the country's workforce, writes Virginia
Marsh in Bucharest.
The creation of the new union, CNSLR-Fratia, follows a failed general strike
last month when the unions disagreed.
