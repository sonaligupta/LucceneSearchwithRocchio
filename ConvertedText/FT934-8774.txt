FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Qantas finance director resigns

QANTAS, the Australian airline, has lost Mr Graham Jones, its finance
director, less than one month after Mr James Strong took over as managing
director.
Qantas, in which British Airways holds a 25 per cent stake, announced
yesterday that Mr Jones, chief financial officer, had resigned afteronly 11
months with the company. It said Mr Jones would leave the carrier at the end
of November 'to pursue further specialised project roles'.
This means Qantas will have changed chairman, managing director and finance
director in nine months.
Qantas, which has seen upheavals and management changes recently as its own
international operations have been merged with those of the domestic
Australian Airlines and the combined entity prepared for privatisation,
declined to comment on whether the departure was amicable or not.
But a formal statement said Mr Jones had joined Qantas 'specifically to be
involved in the heavy programme of activities leading up to immediate public
float of the airline'.
'With the deferment (of the flotation) until probably at least early 1995,
Mr Jones said he felt he could not make the required commitment to Qantas to
stay on for at least a further three to five years, encompassing the float
and consequential beddingdown process,' the airline said.
Mr Jones had joined Qantas in mid-December last year.
Government plans to float the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas have been
pushed back several times because of the airline's poor financial results.
Last month, Qantas announced a pre-tax loss of ADollars 413.5m (USDollars
276m) for the year ended June.
