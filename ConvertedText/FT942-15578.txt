FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: M&G accepts GKN's offer for Westland


   By TIM BURT


M&G, one of the largest institutional shareholders in Westland Group,
yesterday said it was accepting GKN's revised takeover offer for the
helicopter manufacturer.
The institution said it did not want to remain as a minority shareholder
following the engineering group's hostile bid for Westland, in which it
holds 12 per cent.
M&G's decision is expected to prompt other institutions to accept the 335p a
share offer. GKN has also offered a partial share alternative or 290p plus a
share of any compensation received from the Arab Organisation for
Industrialisation.
The AOI has been ordered to pay Westland Pounds 385m in damages over an
alleged breach of contract in the late 1970s.
Institutions which have yet to formally accept GKN's offer are understood to
favour the partial share alternative, worth 344 1/2 p on GKN's 584p share
price yesterday. They include Schroders, controlling 13.5 per cent of
Westland, and Royal Insurance with 4 per cent.
GKN, which expressed confidence that the institutions would accept its
offers, yesterday confirmed that it had invited shareholders to take part in
the second tranche of its Pounds 248m rights issue to fund the Westland
takeover.
It also said discussions were continuing between Sir David Lees, its
chairman, and Mr Alan Jones, his Westland counterpart, on the integration of
the helicopter company into GKN's defence division.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Jones will remain with the enlarged group
once the integration has been completed.
