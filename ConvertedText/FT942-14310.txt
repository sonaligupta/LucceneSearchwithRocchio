FT  21 APR 94 / US and Seoul plan for military manoeuvres


   By JOHN BURTON

The US will hold its Team Spirit military exercise in South Korea some time
in November if North Korea continues to refuse full international nuclear
inspections.
The decision was announced yesterday after talks in Seoul between Mr William
Perry, the US defence secretary, and South Korean officials.
The military exercise, which involves extensive ground manoeuvres, cannot be
held earlier because it would disrupt planting and harvesting activities in
farming areas, according to South Korean officials.
However, the late schedule for Team Spirit, which is normally held in the
spring, could weaken its use as a negotiating tactic to pressure North Korea
to allow nuclear inspections.
The US has offered to suspend Team Spirit if North Korea permits nuclear
inspections to proceed. But the International Atomic Energy Agency wants to
conduct the inspections by early next month. North Korea has repeatedly
protested against the staging of the exercises, which have been held almost
annually since 1976, as a provocative act that would raise tensions on the
Korean peninsula.
Analysts believe that the US may use this year's Team Spirit, if it is
conducted, as a means to stockpile more US military equipment in South
Korea. Mr Perry said that the US and South Korea had agreed to improve their
defence preparations through the deployment of new equipment, such as
Patriot anti-missile batteries, Apache attack helicopters and mobile missile
early-warning systems.
The US is also asking South Korea to purchase artillery targeting systems
that would spot the location of thousands of North Korean artillery
batteries along the demilitarised zone.
But Mr Perry emphasised that there is 'no imminent danger of a military
confrontation' and explained the military build-up was a precautionary
measure.
