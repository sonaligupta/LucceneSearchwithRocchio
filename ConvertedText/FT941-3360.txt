Santos, the Adelaide-based oil and gas company, reports a near doubling of
after-tax profits to ADollars 219.3m (USDollars 157.5m) for 1993. In the
previous year, profit after abnormals was ADollars 112.7m.
In part, the sharp improvement was due to a turnround on abnormals. In 1993,
Santos booked a net gain of ADollars 34.9m, reflecting a ADollars 46.6m
surplus on the sale of the company's shares in Sagasco, which was taken over
by Boral last year, a ADollars 44.1m gain from tax-related matters, and a
ADollars 55.8m write-down of capitalisation exploration expenditure. In the
previous year, there was a ADollars 49.9m abnormal charge.
Santos also benefited from lower tax and interest charges, with the latter
falling to ADollars 38.2m from ADollars 50.3m. Earnings before interest and
tax in 1993 stood at ADollars 327.4m, marginally below 1992's ADollars
322.2m.
