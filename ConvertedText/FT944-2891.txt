FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Australian groups buy Kobe mine
stake


   By NIKKI TAIT


Three Australian mining groups have bought the 10 per cent interest in the
Boddington gold mine, in Western Australia, previously held by Kobe Alumina
Associates, for an aggregate ADollars 42.9m. Kobe Alumina is a unit of Kobe
Steel and Nissho Iwai Alumina, writes Nikki Tait.
The three companies are Acacia Resources, the former Shell Australia mining
and minerals business which was floated on the stock market as an
independent company earlier this year; Poseidon Gold, part of the Normandy
Poseidon group; and Newcrest Mining. All three were existing joint venture
partners in the mine.
