FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Non-executive directors


   By DANIEL GREEN


British Biotech has replaced Brian Richards as non-executive chairman with
John Raisman, former chairman and chief executive of Shell UK.
The change came about at Richards' suggestion, says Keith McCullagh, chief
executive of British Biotech.
'Brian is an R&D oriented man. Board discussions are increasingly financial
and commercial. As we move towards commercialisation, it is a fitting
change,' he says.
Raisman, 65, retired from Shell in 1985 after 30 years with the company; he
is a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank, and formerly on the board of
Glaxo.
Richards, 62, a co-founder of the company in 1986, remains on the board.
