WEST GERMAN economic growth gained a welcome lift in the first quarter of
this year from mild winter weather, strong output in the building sector and
1.5 extra working days.
Gross national product was 1.8 per cent higher than in the first three
months of 1991, the federal statistics office reported yesterday. That
growth followed a rise of only 0.6 per cent in the last quarter of 1991, the
lowest increase since the spring of 1987.
Despite further comforting news on the employment front - jobless totals
fell slightly in both parts of the country - industry remains gloomy about
the immediate future.
Business conditions worsened in the west during April, the Ifo economics
institute reported yesterday, and expectations for the next six months
remained pessimistic. According to its monthly business confidence survey,
there were still no signs of improved export business. However, in the east
the rate of job losses had slowed and conditions appeared to have
stabilised, Ifo said.
The value of incoming orders to east German companies contracted by 30 per
cent in February. Foreign orders were down 55 per cent.
The statistics office said spending on construction was 10 per cent up on
the previous year.
