FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rally on hopes of
output cuts


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


OIL PRICES bounced back yesterday as the market was cheered by willingness
among producers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
shave output. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil for March delivery was
22 1/2 cents higher at Dollars 18.12 1/2 a barrel.
The market has risen by almost Dollars 2 a barrel so far this week following
successive announcements from Opec members that they would cut output. The
cuts of some 50,000 barrels a day each are nominal, but the co-operation
between producers has led the market to hope that agreement will be reached
swiftly to make more meaningful cuts at February's meeting.
Nigeria became the latest Opec member to signal its unwillingness to accept
lower prices yesterday when oil minister, Mr Jibril Aminu, said the country
would cut back by 50,000 b/d. Nigeria followed the lead by Venezuela last
week and the announcement by Libya on Tuesday that it would cut 30,000 b/d.
Algeria also indicated yesterday it would be willing to make a voluntary cut
in output. The oil market is, in part, reacting to uncertainty cast over
Algeria's oil sector by the country's political problems and the rise of
religious fundamentalism, which could put off western investors.
The smaller producers who called for an emergency Opec meeting when prices
tumbled late last year, are giving a clear signal to Saudi Arabia, the
export leader, that they will co-operate with production cuts. Saudi Arabia,
Opec's largest producer, is unwilling to carry the burden of cutting back
alone.
Oil prices in New York rose by some 40 cents to Dollars 19.36 a barrel for
the March futures contract in late trading yesterday.
