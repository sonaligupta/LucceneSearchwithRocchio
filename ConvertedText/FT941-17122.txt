FT  06 JAN 94 / People: Insurance moves


Jim Payne, one of the most prominent figures in the London reinsurance
market, is to retire from the Sedgwick Group later this year. Payne, now 56,
retired as chairman of Sedgwick Payne (the Sedgwick Group's reinsurance
subsidiary) at the end of last year, and will leave his position as
vice-chairman of Sedgwick Group itself in March. Payne joined EW Payne in
1954 and did much to build up its reinsurance business in the 1970s and
1980s, both before and after its acquisition by Sedgwick in 1978.
More recently Payne has played a role in attracting corporate capital to the
Lloyd's of London market. He will continue as a board member of CLM
Insurance Fund, one of the new Lloyd's investment trusts. He is succeeded at
Sedgwick Payne by Jonathan Gilbert, deputy chairman and managing director of
Sedgwick Payne and a board director of the group. Gilbert, who is also 56,
has specialised in energy insurance broking. He joined Sedgwick in 1957 and
was appointed to the board in 1981.
