FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Borland and WordPerfect unite
against Microsoft


   By LOUISE KEHOE


   SAN FRANCISCO


BORLAND International and WordPerfect, two of the leading suppliers of
software for personal computers, have formed a strategic alliance to compete
more effectively against Microsoft, the world's largest software company.
The two companies will share technology and other resources but have no
plans to merge, they said.
Initially, Borland and WordPerfect will collaborate in research and
development and jointly support standards for accessing data on different
types of computers. They will also co-ordinate marketing, sales and support
programmes.
Financial terms of the agreement between Borland and WordPerfect were not
revealed. The companies said, however, that it did not include equity
investment by either company.
Next month, Borland will launch the first product resulting from the
alliance, Borland Office for Windows, an integrated software package
combining WordPerfect's popular word-processing program with Borland's
spreadsheet and database programs.
This product will be available only in North America at first, where it will
cost Dollars 595, less than half the price of the three programs that it
combines.
Borland Office will compete with similar 'suites' of application programs
from Microsoft and Lotus Development. According to International Data, a
market research group, Microsoft sold 700,000 suite packages in 1992, and
Lotus 100,000.
However, neither offer a 'suite' package containing a database management
program.
Lotus Development, the US personal computer software company, unveiled a
sharp drop in earnings on flat revenues for its first quarter.
Net income was Dollars 12.3m, or 29 cents per share, a 41 per cent decline
on income of Dollars 20.8m, or 47 cents, last year. Revenues of Dollars 227m
equalled those of the first quarter a year ago.
