FT  24 MAR 92 / Import volumes rise sharply


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


IMPORTS MEASURED in terms of volume rose faster than exports in the UK last
month, government figures showed yesterday.
The volume of imports excluding oil and erratics in the three months to
February rose 3 per cent compared with the three months to November last
year while exports rose by only half as much.
The value of UK exports rose 8.5 per cent last month to reach Pounds 9bn,
while imports rose 6.5 per cent in the month to Pounds 10.1bn.
In the three months to February the value of exports was 1 per cent higher
than in the previous three months and 5.5 per cent higher than a year
earlier.
The three-monthly trend for import value showed them 1.5 per cent higher
than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent higher than a year
before.
Last month's deficit in the current account, which covers trade in goods,
services and certain transfer payments, totalled Pounds 750m, about Pounds
250m worse than the market forecast of Pounds 500m. It compared with a
revised deficit in January of Pounds 858m.
The visible trade deficit - trade in merchandise goods - improved slightly
last month, falling from Pounds 1.2bn in January to just over Pounds 1bn in
February. However, this was the second consecutive month in which the
visible trade deficit had exceeded Pounds 1bn. The poor figure was caused
partly by weaker trade in oil and erratics, and the surplus on these two
items was only Pounds 72m last month compared with Pounds 187m in January.
The estimate of the surplus on invisible earnings such as banking, insurance
and tourism was held at Pounds 300m.
A breakdown of exports and imports measured by value shows that imports of
manufactured goods, excluding erratics such as aircraft and precious stones,
grew by 2 per cent in the latest three months while exports of manufactured
goods rose 2.5 per cent.
Imports of finished manufactures, which include consumer durables and cars,
grew by 2.5 per cent in the three months to last month - ahead of exports
which grew by 2 per cent.
Within finished manufactures, the outlook for the UK motor industry was
bleak. Exports of cars fell 4.5 per cent in the three months to February
while imports rose 13 per cent.
However, the value of imports of capital goods rose 1.5 per cent in the
latest three months compared with the previous three months while exports
fell 1 per cent. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the rise in imports
of capital goods was a sign that companies were investing in plant and
equipment.
The value of chemicals exports, one of the few buoyant sectors of the
economy, rose 2.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the
three months to November and by 12 per cent on the year.
Imports of food, beverages and tobacco, measured by value, rose 5.5 per cent
in the latest three months and by 13 per cent on the year.
Britain's surplus on oil fell slightly last month to Pounds 100m compared
with Pounds 200m in January.
The January fall in exports to the European Community was reversed last
month. Exports to the EC rose 2 per cent in the three months to last month
compared with the previous quarter and by 5.5 per cent on the year.
Exports to north America fell 0.5 per cent.
Imports from the EC rose by 2 per cent on the three-monthly basis and by 3
per cent compared with a year ago.
Imports from other OECD countries, which include Japan, jumped by 18 per
cent in the latest three months, bringing the year-on-year increase to 25
per cent.
