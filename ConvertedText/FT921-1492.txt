FT  24 MAR 92 / International Company News: Tighter margins hit Pick 'n Pay

RECESSION in South Africa caused earnings at Pick 'n Pay, the country's
largest supermarket chain, to slip in the year to February.
Turnover rose 13.9 per cent to R5.91bn (Dollars 2.05bn), but tighter margins
meant trading income declined to R127.9m from R133.5m a year earlier. The
trading margin fell to 2.16 per cent from 2.57 per cent amid conditions
described by Mr Raymond Ackerman, chairman, as the toughest he has
experienced in 25 years.
Earnings dropped 2.5 per cent to R84.4m, with earnings per share similarly
down at 107.9 cents. The total dividend was maintained at 57.5 cents.
Pick 'n Pay said its results showed it could not be blamed for the high
level of food price inflation in the country. Food price rises have been
singled out as the main culprit for the relative lack of success in driving
down inflation in the country despite tight monetary policy by the Reserve
Bank, the central bank.
The South African Central Statistical Service has estimated food price
increases in 1991 were about 28 per cent. Pick 'n Pay disputes this figure,
saying it overstates the importance of small traders and meat sales.
Prices in its stores, including tax, rose by 13 to 14 per cent during the
year. Mr Ackerman said higher-margin, non-food sales, which account for
about 20 per cent of the group's total sales, were subsidising food sales,
not the other way round.
Although South Africa is only expecting 1 per cent real economic growth in
1992, the directors are confident Pick 'n Pay will achieve real growth in
the year ahead.
