FT  22 DEC 92 / GDP edges 0.1% ahead in real terms


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


THE UK economy performed marginally better than thought in the third
quarter, although government figures released yesterday indicated that most
areas of activity were flat.
The Central Statistical Office reported that gross domestic product grew by
a seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent in real, inflation-adjusted terms between
the second and third quarters. That contrasted with a provisional
announcement a month ago that GDP had not changed in the third quarter.
Excluding oil and gas production, GDP fell 0.2 per cent compared with 0.3
per cent reported earlier.
Both GDP measures were 0.7 per cent lower than in the third quarter of 1991,
bringing the cumulative decline in output since the recession started in the
second quarter of 1990 to about 4 per cent.
Although this recession has lasted longer than that of 1979-81 it is still
less deep. GDP fell then by 5.4 per cent and the non-oil economy contracted
by 6.2 per cent.
Third-quarter GDP details underlined the UK's growing dependence on imports
and financial flows from abroad.
Consumers' expenditure was stronger than the overall economy, growing a real
0.4 per cent between the second and third quarters and 0.3 per cent compared
with the third quarter of 1991.
One consequence of that was higher net imports of goods and services worth
Pounds 4.3bn (at 1985 prices) in the third quarter, against Pounds 4.1bn in
the previous three months and Pounds 2.6bn in the third quarter of last
year.
The UK's real national disposable income also grew more than GDP. It rose
1.1 per cent between the second and third quarters of this year and fell by
only 0.2 per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991, largely because
of a steep increase in third-quarter net property income from abroad to
Pounds 1.73bn.
Other GDP highlights were:
Faster growth of profits than wages. Income from employment rose 3.2 per
cent in current prices compared with the third quarter of 1991, while
companies' gross trading profits were up 7.7 per cent. Increases between the
second and third quarters were 0.3 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively.
Less destocking. Stocks fell by Pounds 201m (at 1985 prices) in the quarter,
the lowest quarterly drop since de-stocking began at the end of 1990.
Broadly unchanged fixed investment. It dropped 0.1 per cent in real terms
compared with both the second quarter of 1992 and the third quarter of last
year.
Spending on vehicles, ships and aircraft rose 10.6 per cent compared with
last year, partly reflecting a recent revival in fleet demand for new cars.
Investment in new dwellings rose strongly, by 10.7 per cent, compared with
the second quarter - probably reflecting increased demand ahead of the
expiry in August of the temporary suspension of stamp duty on most house
purchases.
The CSO also disclosed that unit labour costs for the whole economy rose 3
per cent compared with the third quarter of 1991, the lowest rate of growth
since the end of 1968.
Productivity across the economy grew by 2.4 per cent, its highest rate for
five years.
