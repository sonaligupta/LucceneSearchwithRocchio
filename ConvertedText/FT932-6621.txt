FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Board changes as Olives Property seeks
Pounds 2.55m


OLIVES PROPERTY yesterday announced a placing and open offer to raise Pounds
2.55m after expenses.
The company, which also reported a Pounds 1.69m pre-tax loss for 1992, said
the funds would be used to reduce borrowings and provide capital for
investment.
In addition, the board plans to appoint Mr Anthony Grant, non-executive
chairman of Grant & Partners, as chairman and joint chief executive and Mr
Gary Leigh of First Argyll as joint chief executive.
Mr Kent and Mr Gerald Jiggins, finance director, will remain non-executive
directors.
The shares of Mr Kent and family settlements are held through Kent Holdings,
which owns 50.54 per cent of Olives. It has agreed to sell 2.19m ordinary
Olives shares at 31p each to the new management.
Mr Grant (and trustees under his family settlement) will be investing about
Pounds 1.5m (including a limited non-recourse loan to Mr Leigh for the
purpose of his share acquisition and placing.)
Under the 4-for-3 placing of 9.76m shares at 28p each, Mr Grant and the
trustees have irrevocably undertaken to take up a total of 2.05m new
ordinary shares and Mr Leigh has undertaken to take up 878,225.
Following all transactions Mr Grant and the trustees will hold 3.59m shares,
representing 20.99 per cent of the capital and Mr Leigh will hold 1.54m
shares, or 9 per cent.
Kent Holdings has undertaken to apply for 2.01m ordinary shares under the
open offer. In addition, it has a commitment under the placing of up to
1.58m shares.
Olives' results for 1992 were hit by an exceptional item of Pounds 1.34m,
which helped turn last time's Pounds 718,600 pre-tax surplus into a Pounds
1.69m deficit.
Sales rose to Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 1.58m).
An extraordinary item of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 327,700) represented provision
against the carrying value of investments in Continental Paper Group, the
former associate company which has gone into receivership.
Losses per share amounted to 21.55p (5.78p earnings). The final dividend has
been omitted, leaving the total at 1.5p, against 6p in 1991.
Following a review of the balance sheet, the proposed directors intend to
dispose of certain assets which Kent Holdings has agreed to acquire. It is
also intended to move the head office from Bristol to London.
An extraordinary meeting will be held on June 18 to seek approval for the
above proposals.
