Poland yesterday awarded the first 12 regional TV licences to NTP Plus, a
Warsaw-based consortium led by Independent Polish Television (NTP) and
Central European Media Enterprises (CME). NTP Plus will initially transmit
programmes terrestrially to an area which includes Warsaw, the capital, and
roughly one third of the Polish television audience. It plans to set up
regional TV stations in Warsaw and three other cities with an investment of
up to Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.2m). NTP is headed by Mr Miroslaw Chojecki, a
Polish entrepreneur. CME is privately owned; its main shareholder is Mr
Ronald Lauder, heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics group fortune, backed by
US and Canadian businessmen. Poland, with its population of 39m people, is
the largest TV market in central Europe.
