FT  20 APR 91 / Electricity sell-off 'an environmental disaster'


   By JULIET SYCHRAVA


THE Labour party plans reforms that would force the electricity industry to
take the environment more seriously, according to a paper published
yesterday by Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary.
Mr Dobson's paper followed Wednesday's Commons committee report on energy
efficiency, which attacked the government for failing to introduce measures
to conserve energy. The industry's privatisation had been 'an environmental
disaster', Mr Dobson said. It had failed to introduce any measures to clean
up electricity generation, develop renewable energy sources such as wind
power, or encourage energy efficiency.
The government had cut spending on scrubbing equipment for power stations
from the Pounds 2bn it promised in 1989 to Pounds 1.2bn, Mr Dobson said. A
Labour government would install more scrubbing equipment and would invest in
new technologies for burning coal more cleanly and efficiently. It would set
up an agency to promote renewable energy.
The report did not specify the cost of the proposed measures, but said that
the Labour party would introduce a 'cleaner energy levy' to replace the
nuclear levy, which raises more than Pounds 1.15bn every year.
The government had restructured the industry on the principle of maximising
electricity sales without considering the issue of investment in energy
conservation, Mr Dobson said. Labour would require the regional electricity
companies to spend their own money on energy-efficiency measures.
