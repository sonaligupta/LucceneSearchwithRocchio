FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Supasnaps behind Sketchley's 16% rise


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


A GOOD contribution from Supasnaps helped Sketchley, the dry cleaning,
textile rental and film processing group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 16
per cent to Pounds 3.6m compared with Pounds 3.1m.
Sketchley acquired Supasnaps from Dixons last April for Pounds 4.3m, plus
Pounds 2m goodwill. Mr John Richardson, deputy chairman, said the
acquisition had 'performed exceptionally well', generating Pounds 6m of cash
to date.
Supasnaps contributed Pounds 2m to operating profits in the 26 weeks ended
October 1. However, the group warned that profits from film processing would
be significantly less in the second half because of the seasonality of the
business.
Operating profits from the rest of the group fell to Pounds 2.36m, against
Pounds 3.74m in the 27 weeks to October 2 last year.
Mr Tony Bloom, joint deputy chairman, said the dry cleaning business had
proved tough and competitive, particularly in the south-east of England.
The group was responding with an aggressive price promotion campaign.
The textile rental division, which supplies workwear for British Coal's
miners, won a net increase in customers for the first time in three years
during the half. But in spite of reduced dependence on British Coal, the
falling number of miners would continue to affect profits in the second
half.
Mr Richardson said the jewel in the crown of Supasnaps was its strong retail
management team. The group is to merge its dry cleaning division with
Supasnaps.
Mr Richardson said the group had closed 30 lossmaking dry cleaning stores
and 22 lossmaking Supasnaps branches.
It now had over 750 retail outlets, including 460 dry cleaners, and planned
to have 100 fully-integrated stores by the end of next year.
Total group revenues rose from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 75.6m, including a
Pounds 24m contribution from Supasnaps.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 721,000, and gearing
was up from 17.7 per cent to 26.8 per cent.
Earnings per share moved ahead from 4.2p to 4.4p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 1p a share.
