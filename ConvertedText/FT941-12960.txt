FT  27 JAN 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts recover their poise after
post-auction dip

   LONDON, NEW YORK


UK government bonds dipped immediately after the release of disappointing
results to the Bank of England's Pounds 2.75bn auction of stock due 2010
yesterday. However, they recovered their poise relatively quickly in the
belief that the market's upward trend was still intact.
Analysts said that prices were supported by the positive outlook for
inflation in the UK and the fact that the Bank was well ahead in its funding
programme.
In addition, traders said they were confident that most of yesterday's
supply of gilts had gone straight into the hands of domestic institutions
and were unlikely to come back into the market.
The cover on the auction was 1.21 times, which compared with market
expectations of around 1 1/2 times, while the tail was two basis points,
above hopes of one basis point or less.
The March long gilt future on Liffe fell as low as 118 23/32 but by the end
of the day it was trading around 119 1/16 , down  13/32 points on the day.
By contrast, long-dated gilts fell around  5/8 points.
More positive news on inflation and renewed hopes of an early cut in
interest rates helped German government bonds to break their losing streak
yesterday.
The March bund future on Liffe rebounded from an intraday low of 99.74 to
trade around 100.21 late in the afternoon, up 0.40 on the day.
Some analysts were encouraged that the March future had bounced back above
par and they were confident that it would remain above par for the
foreseeable future.
However, they noted that most of the activity was in the futures market
whereas the cash market was reasonably quiet.
A disappointing reception to the Japanese ministry of finance's monthly
auction of 10-year government bonds kept the downward pressure on Japanese
government bonds yesterday.
Although the size of the auction, at Y1,000bn, came in below the market's
expectations of between Y1,200bn and Y1,300bn, the coupon was set at 3.7 per
cent as opposed to hopes of a coupon of 3.8 per cent.
As a result, the bid-to-cover ratio was just 1.44 (which traders said was
the worst in recent history), the average yield was 3.904 per cent and the
lowest successful bid was at 3.958 per cent.
The March future dropped as low as 113.44 in Tokyo trading before closing at
113.60, down more than a point on the day.
The future later bounced back to around 114.20 in London but dealers warned
that the outlook for the market remained vulnerable due to persistent
worries about supply and the likely re-allocation of assets from bonds to
equities.
US bond prices moved higher yesterday in spite of lacklustre bidding in the
Treasury's auction of Dollars 12bn in new five-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 higher at
98 3/16 , after slipping as much as  1/4 early in the session. The yield
eased to 6.306 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note inched  1/32
ahead to 99 3/4 , to yield 4.115 per cent.
The session got off to a slow start, with a winter storm over much of the
east coast. Traders allowed prices to drift lower but as activity picked up,
there were modest gains across the maturity range.
After a disappointing follow-through on Tuesday's sale of new two-year
notes, the market had approached the afternoon's five-year auction with
caution. In the event, dealer-led demand was just fair. The notes were
awarded at a yield of 5.10 per cent, on the weak side of expectations.
Afterwards, when-issued five-year bonds dipped, but soon firmed in
speculative buying. Near the session's end, the yield was at 5.052 per cent,
against 5.099 per cent at the opening, with the price  1/16 ahead at 100
9/32.
