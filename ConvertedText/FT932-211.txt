FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia to buy Russian and US fighters


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and DANIEL GREEN


A FIERCE 18-month contest between the world's leading military aircraft
manufacturers ended yesterday with a decision by Malaysia to split its
purchase between Russia and the US.
Mr Najib Abdul Razak, Malaysian defence minister, announced it would buy 18
MiG-29s and eight McDonnell Douglas F/A-18s. Details of the deal, thought to
be worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m), have still to be negotiated.
He said the Russian jets would be paid for in 'cash and commodities' while
the US aircraft would be paid for in cash.
By opting for MiG-29s, Malaysia will become the first member of the
Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to equip itself with Russian
aircraft. The other members are Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand,
Singapore and Brunei.
The contest, to replace ageing US-supplied F-5 fighters, was narrowed down
after Malaysia rejected the French Mirage 2000 and the Anglo-German-Italian
Tornado.
Also eliminated in the competition was the Lockheed F-16, the most
successful fighter in previous sales contests in the region.
Malaysia originally planned to buy a squadron of Tornados from the UK under
a 1988 accord but changed its mind two years later and bought British
Aerospace Hawk light fighter/trainers instead.
Russia reinforced its sales campaign by proposing to accept part-payment for
the MiG-29s in palm oil and other products. But the Royal Malaysian Air
Force voiced concern about Russia's ability to support the aircraft once in
service and is reported to have insisted on including at least some of the
multi-role F/A-18s. The only other country in the region with F/A-18s is
Australia.
Japan Air System, Japan's third biggest carrier formerly called Toa
Domestic, yesterday ordered seven Boeing 777 aircraft worth Dollars 820m,
