FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mechanisms for unitary councils
already in two-tier system


   From Mrs M P CASE


Sir, Martin Easteal, chief executive of the Local Government Commission,
described his vision (Letters, December 29) of the outcome of the
commission's local government review - 'a structure that will ensure local
government in the future meets the needs of the community in such a way that
many of the functions now undertaken by quangos may instead become the
responsibility of local authorities'.
That future is not equally envisioned by ministers who are hardly likely to
concur with the implied undermining of major Conservative restructuring in
the fields of, for example, health, education and waste management. There,
power and responsibility have been passed to trusts, to parents and
teachers, to companies at arm's length from, and more commercially driven
than, local councils.
Moreover, on the ground in the shires, notably in my own county, the
preferred option being urged by the lead commissioner, namely the creation
of aggregations of districts, ostensibly unitary, is already necessitating
proposals for the establishment of a range of joint strategic authorities.
They include transportation and planning, and joint boards for police, fire,
magistrates, probation etc.
Specialist areas in childcare, and the education of children with learning
difficulties, are to be handled by agencies; county archives, the Lord
Lieutenancy and other functions will be managed by different 'lead'
authorities.
Surely all of these mechanisms are as dispersed and distanced from the new
unitary council concept as the apparently despised quangos.
How can a system be sufficiently resilient to take over the roles of quango,
and yet require the creation of manifold bodies to facilitate anew the
combination of strategic thinking and local delivery which are the hallmark
of the present two-tier system in many parts of England?
