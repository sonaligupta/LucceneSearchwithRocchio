FT  04 SEP 93 / Remittances boost Philippines economy

THE PHILIPPINES' economy, mostly stagnant since 1990, registered growth of
1.8 per cent in the first half of the year, according to government data
released yesterday.
The first-half growth, reported by the National Statistical Co-ordination
Board, dispels fears of prolonged stagnation resulting from severe power
cuts in Manila and the main Luzon island since October 1992.
The growth rate was boosted by a sustained inflow of remittances from
Filipino workers abroad. Without the workers' remittances, gross domestic
product grew by only 0.7 per cent, although that was still an improvement
over the first-half economic performance of the past two years. In the first
half of 1992, for instance, GDP declined by 0.13 per cent.
The best performer was the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sector, which
posted a 2.5 per cent expansion. The industrial sector, however, declined
1.5 per cent in the half year mainly because of the power shortage.
