FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Canada forest group reduces
first-half loss


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

FLETCHER Challenge Canada, the integrated forest products group, reduced
losses in the first quarter of fiscal 1994. The company, controlled by
Fletcher Challenge of New Zealand, was helped by higher timber and coated
paper prices, increased pulp and newsprint shipments and a lower Canadian
dollar.
For the three months to September 30, the company posted a loss of CDollars
12.9m (USDollars 9.9m) or 11 cents a share, against a deficit of CDollars
18.8m or 24 cents, on sales ahead to CDollars 378m from CDollars 207m last
time. The rise in sales came partly from inclusion of the Elk Falls pulp and
paper operation acquired last February.
FCC, which had a small profit in the June quarter, is putting most of its
wood products and logging operations into a new company, TimberWest. It will
then sell 49 per cent of the company to the public.
The group said industry-wide shutdowns appear to have stabilised pulp prices
and there might be an improvement in 1994.
