FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure upbeat and buying
bookmakers chain


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


SHARES IN Stanley Leisure rose 20p to 249p yesterday as the betting shops
and casino group issued an upbeat trading statement and announced the Pounds
6m acquisition of the bookmakers chain Selwyn Demmy (Racing).
The company said yesterday that after the first six months, 'the trading
performance in both the betting shop and casino divisions are considerably
ahead of the same period last year.'
Analysts revised their forecasts for the year to the end of April from
Pounds 9m to Pounds 10m.
Stanley is buying 49 betting shops in the north-west of England through the
acquisition of Demmy Investments, which owns Demmy Racing. Demmy's 49 shops
bring the number of outlets operated by Stanley's racing division to 401.
The company said that it expected to make significant savings from the
integration of Demmy's shops with its own.
Stanley is paying Pounds 6m for Demmy Investments. This figure will be
adjusted however, subject to Demmy's net asset position.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 589,520 Stanley Leisure
shares at 229p, Pounds 250,000 in cash and the balance in loan notes
repayable within three to five years. The vendor has agreed not to sell the
Stanley shares for at least one year.
Demmy Racing returned profits of Pounds 247,000 for the year to February 27,
on sales of Pounds 25.2m. However, this was before charges of Pounds 242,000
for interest on loans to the company by directors, depreciation of goodwill,
and executives remuneration.
Demmy Investments is expected to show a debt of Pounds 1.65m to Mr Selwyn
Demmy, which will be repaid in cash on completion.
Last year Stanley Leisure returned annual profits of Pounds 8.05m, a rise of
3 per cent, in spite of foregoing an estimated Pounds 300,000 profit on the
Grand National debacle at Aintree when the race was declared void after two
false starts.
Sales for the 53 weeks were Pounds 218.4m, against Pounds 203.3m in 1992.
