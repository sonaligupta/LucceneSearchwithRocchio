FT  16 DEC 94 / People: Non-executive directors


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Yorkshire Water yesterday appointed two non-executive directors less than
three months after rejecting smaller shareholders' attempts to elect a
similar candidate to the board.
Yorkshire has appointed Patricia Marsh, 48, (above) and Colin Cooke, 54, to
replace retiring directors, Tom Jackson and David Cramb.
Marsh, former managing director of Ace Coin Equipment, one of the UK's
largest distributors and manufacturers of electronic interactive machines
for the leisure industry, is a former member of the customer services
committee for the water industry regulator's Central region. Her appointment
follows the resistance of Yorkshire management and institutional
shareholders to the nomination of Diana Scott, former chairman of the Ofwat
Yorkshire customer services committee.
At the time, Yorkshire's board argued that Scott, who had the support of a
substantial number of smaller shareholders, did not have the relevant
business experience.
Yorkshire yesterday sought to stress Marsh's business qualifications, citing
her positions as non-executive director at Yorkshire-based Rosebys, the
households and soft furnishings retailer, and chairman of the Birmingham
Children's Hospital.
Cooke, who will join the board in the spring, is chairman of industrial
groups Triplex Lloyd and Fenner, and a non-executive of Ash & Lacy and
British Dredging.
