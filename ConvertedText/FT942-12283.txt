FT  30 APR 94 / Russia and Latvia to sign troop pull-out


   By JOHN LLOYD

An agreement to pull out the remaining Russian troops from Latvia is
expected to be signed today in Moscow by the leaders of the two states.
The agreement will mean that only Estonia, the smallest of the three former
Soviet Baltic countries, is at odds with Russia over troop withdrawal.
Negotiators agreed on the last issue between them - that of payment of
pensions and other benefits to the 22,300 Russian military veterans still
living in Latvia - at a meeting yesterday in the resort town of Jurmala.
The agreement allows the officers to stay in Latvia with benefits, but not
to obtain citizenship - a clause which nationalists in the Latvian
parliament say gives retrospective justification to the occupation of Latvia
by Soviet troops between 1940 and 1991.
The Latvians have also agreed to rent out the Skrunda radar base to the
Russians for the next four years.
The sudden worsening in relations between the two countries when a decree
signed by President Boris Yeltsin appeared to suggest that Russia wished to
keep troops in Latvia appears to have been patched over.
Mr Guntis Ulmanis, Latvian president and Mr Valdis Birkavs, prime minister,
are due in Moscow today to sign the treaty with Mr Yeltsin - a treaty which
should remove all 10,500 Russian troops by the end of August.
The deal, if carried through, focuses all attention on Estonia, where fewer
than 3,000 troops remain but where talks have proved fruitless.
