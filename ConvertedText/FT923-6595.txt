FT  24 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading water treatment works


BALFOUR BEATTY has been awarded a Pounds 12.5m design and construct contract
for the modemisation of the Tittesworth Water Treatment Works by Severn
Trent Water, with Acer Engineering acting as engineer.
The contract will be executed by an internal collaboration between the water
industry unit and the central unit of Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering, with
Balfour Beatty Projects & Engineering providing the detailed design.
Located two kilometres north of Leek, Staffordshire, the existing works
treats water from Tittesworth Reservoir by conventional gravity
clarification and sand filtration, to a design typical of its period, the
1960s.
The new works will replace the existing plant, with enhanced technology
comprising clarification by dissolved air flotation (DAF), first stage sand
filtration, second stage sand filtration and disinfection.
This treatment stream includes dosing systems for various different
treatment chemicals and systems for waste water reclamation and sludge
disposal. Also included in the contract, which is scheduled for completion
in the autumn of 1994, is refurbishment of the ancillary plant.
