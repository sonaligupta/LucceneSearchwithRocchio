327m in Harjavalta metals complex

   HELSINKI


OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish metals and mining group, is to modernise the
production facilities at its Harjavalta plant through an investment
programme worth FM1.8bn (Dollars 326.9m), Reuter reports from Helsinki.
'Capacity at the nickel production line will increase to 32,000 tonnes per
year, the copper smelter's capacity will increase to 160,000 tpy and the
copper refinery's to 125,000 tpy,' Outokumpu said.
The programme, to run between 1993 and 1996, includes the copper smelter and
nickel production line located at Harjavalta and the copper refinery located
at Pori, both towns in western Finland.
Nickel production will increase from 18,000 tpy, copper smelter capacity
from 100,000 tpy and copper refinery capacity from 70,000 tpy.
'The raw material required for expanded nickel production will be sourced
from Outokumpu's wholly owned Forrestania nickel mine in Western Australia
and through a long-term purchase agreement for concentrate from Western
Mining Corporation's Mt Keith mine when it starts up in 1995,' Outokumpu
said.
'The copper raw material supply is based on the production of Outokumpu's
own copper mines, existing long-term purchase agreements and additional
future agreements,' Outokumpu said.
Outokumpu said these copper and nickel production facilities would be among
the most efficient units in the world.
'These investments also mean a considerable improvement in terms of
environmental production. The Harjavalta's works' emissions will be reduced
from current levels even though production will almost double.'
