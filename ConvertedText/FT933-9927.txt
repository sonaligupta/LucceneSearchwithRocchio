FT  06 AUG 93 / International Company News: Vard losses widen to NKr212m in
first half

VARD, the troubled Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday disclosed a
sharp deterioration in first-half pre-tax losses to NKr212.20m (Dollars
29.4m) from NKr124.54m last year.
The weaker performance is attributed to substantially higher interest
payments on debt and losses by the group's ferry operations. The company's
shares yesterday closed down NKr2.50 at NKr28.
Group revenue increased to NKr3.35bn from NKr2.69bn as operating expenses
widened to NKr2.97bn from NKr2.31bn. Operating profits fell to NKr161.63m
from NKr210.21m.
Net financial items for the six-month period rose to NKr373.83m from
NKr235.39m. The rise was largely due to an increase in net interest expenses
to NKr310.44m from NKr233.33m resulting from a financial restructuring of
Kloster Cruise in May when Dollars 300m in 10-year secured notes was issued
at a coupon of 13 per cent.
Kloster's half-year losses rose to NKr116.9m from NKr100.9m as increased
competition in European waters put pressure on summer prices.
Larvik Line, one of Vard's two ferry operations, plunged into a six-month
loss of NKr15.8m from profit of NKr11.2m last year, due to stagnation in
traffic between Norway and Denmark. Scandi Line, the other ferry operation,
also fell into a half-year loss of NKr3.1m against a profit of NKr1.7m, in
spite of an increase in passenger volume.
Mr Ketil Arvesen, analyst with Oslo-based Finanshuset, said the general
trend in domestic ferry traffic was weak but that Vard's troubles were
exacerbated by having to fill a bigger fleet.
Vard last month halted negotiations to dispose of ferry operations to a
group of investors led by Union Bank of Switzerland which offered NKr1.1bn
for the business.
Sparebanken Nor, known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, yesterday
unveiled a sharp improvement in first-half net profit to NKr741m (Dollars
101.5m) from NKr3m last year. Group net interest income rose to NKr1.514bn
from NKr1.341bn as operating income increased to NKr2.66bn from NKr1.85bn,
helped by a sharp rise in securities gains to NKr575m from NKr77m.
Operating profit in the six-month period increased to NKr1.42bn from
NKr663m. First-half losses on loans and guarantees rose slightly to NKr651m
from NKr643m. The bank forecast a weaker second-half performance.
