FT  16 NOV 93 / Denmark-Sweden bridge go-ahead

A SWEDISH court yesterday approved controversial plans to build a Dollars
3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) road and rail bridge between Denmark and Sweden, but laid
tough environmental conditions on the project.
Sweden's prime minister Carl Bildt said his right-centre coalition, which is
split on the issue, would soon take a final decision on the 17km link
between Malmo and Copenhagen, on which construction is supposed to begin
next year.
Sweden and Denmark agreed to build the bridge in 1991, but it has faced
strong opposition, particularly in Sweden, because of fears it would hinder
vital salt water flows into the already heavily-polluted Baltic Sea and
break international agreements on limiting vehicle exhaust emissions.
The so-called Water Court, which rules on all projects effecting waterways,
gave the go-ahead, but insisted on changes in the construction proposals
drawn up by the Swedish-Danish consortium planning the bridge.
It called for a shift in the planned site of an artificial island, tight
controls on spillage from dredging, and three-dimensional computer models of
the construction process to be commissioned from two independent
institutions before construction went ahead.
