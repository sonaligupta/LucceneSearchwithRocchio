FT  04 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Danish referendum triggers widespread
sell-off across Europe


   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB


EUROPEAN bond markets were sent reeling yesterday following the Danish
referendum on European union.
The Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty has thrown the future of
monetary union into doubt and consequently destroyed the theory of
convergence, which has driven European bond markets for the past few years.
If European monetary union is no longer a certainty, the rationale for
European economies to move closer together - causing rates in
higher-yielding markets to fall - evaporates.
The Ecu bond market bore the brunt of yesterday's sell-off, although prices
regained about  1/2 point after suffering losses of as much as two points.
The new issues market in Ecus is now closed for the foreseeable future,
reversing its recent substantial growth. Dealers said liquidity had dried up
as participants tried to sell bonds. Since many traders had expected the
treaty to be ratified by Denmark, prompting a rally in the Ecu bond market,
there were numerous long positions, which proved difficult to liquidate.
On the Matif, the Ecu bond future fell the maximum 1 1/2 points, triggering
temporary suspension of the contract. When trading reopened, the price
rallied about 18 basis points to close at 105-92.
'Unless we see a quick solution, the risks are very severe, compared with
other markets,' said Mr Neil Rogers, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew.
THE Italian government bond market slumped by over 1.5 points as investors
scrambled to move out of high-yielding bonds in the wake of the Danish
referendum.
The futures contract settled 160 basis points lower in trading of 62,000
lots, but finished off the day's lows.
The May 2002 bond ended at 96.97-97.04, well below the previous day's close
of 98.08-98.11, while the Liffe September BTP contract settled at 96.69,
against 98.29 on the previous day.
UK government bonds plummeted over 1 point following Denmark's vote and the
announcement that France now intends to hold a referendum on treaty
ratification.
The outcome of the Danish referendum raised fears of a realignment in the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and led to concern
in the gilt market over the ease with which the government will be able to
fund the public-sector borrowing requirement in future.
Long-dated gilts showed the sharpest falls, with the benchmark 11 3/4 per
cent due 2003/07 dropping from 117 7/8 to 116 5/8 . At the shorter end of
the market, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell from 101 1/2 to 101 11/32 .
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 99.13 to 98.16. Volumes were very
heavy at about 70,000 contracts.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at SG Warburg, said Denmark's vote raised
fears of a realignment of the EMS currencies. 'If you are looking for who
might be desperate to devalue, the UK has to be on the list of candidates,'
Mr Richardson said, pointing to the UK's inflation and current account
problems.
THE French bond market held up better than most other markets apart from
Germany, although prices fell about  1/2 point on an announcement that
France will hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty later this year. The
French government bond contract on the Matif ended  3/4 point lower at
107.78.
The French market came through better than most mainly because of strong
economic fundamentals, which convinced traders that the market did not rely
on the constraints of monetary union. 'Markets like France and Holland have
independent credibility,' said one analyst.
THE German bond market was the main beneficiary of the uncertainty over the
future of European monetary union yesterday, with dealers reporting a strong
rise in bunds at the start of trading.
'There was a marked flight to low-yielding, non-converging instruments such
as bunds,' said one dealer.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.98 and rose to 88.07 within an
hour of the market opening. After dropping to a low of 87.61, the future
ended the day around 87.75. Volumes in the futures market were high.
THE Nordic government bond markets dropped over 1 point initially, but later
made some recovery as investors looked for bargains.
Danish bonds dropped 2 points on Tuesday evening after the referendum
results came out. The 9 per cent 2000 bond closed at 101.90 on Tuesday,
opened at 99.60 yesterday, and ended the day at 100.30 to yield 8.93 per
cent.
JAPANESE government bond prices climbed yesterday as the yen strengthened
against the US dollar following the Bank of Japan's intervention in the
foreign exchange markets.
The dollar opened at Y127.00 and ended at Y126.90 in Tokyo, but later moved
to Y127.50 in London trading.
The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 5.505 per cent and closed at
5.485 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract climbed from
its opening level of 101.85 to reach a high of 102.08, but traders said this
marked a strong resistance level, and the futures contract fell back on
profit-taking to close at 101.95.
US Treasury markets settled down yesterday after some early profit-taking in
the wake of Tuesday's late rally on the Federal Reserve's surprise coupon
pass. Prices were left little changed in subdued trading.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  1/8 at
101 13/32 , yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer,
up  1/32 at 99 7/8 , yielding 5.175 per cent.
The market generally ignored the day's economic news - a 1 per cent increase
in factory orders during April, and an upward revision in annual
unemployment figures. Investors remained reluctant to trade ahead of
tomorrow's key employment report for May.
