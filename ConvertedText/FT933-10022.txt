FT  06 AUG 93 / Overseas shares hit turnover record


   By NORMA COHEN


TURNOVER in overseas equities hit an all-time high in July, rising Pounds
3bn on the previous month to Pounds 50.7bn, the London Stock Exchange said
yesterday, Norma Cohen writes.
The total for the first seven months of the year was Pounds 302.1bn, with
nearly two-thirds transacted through firm quotes on the exchange's SEAQ
International system. The exchange estimates that 90 per cent of all
cross-border transactions in Europe are through SEAQ International.
The exchange said 'preoccupation with the ERM was evident' as trading in
European securities rose to 71 per cent of all foreign transactions, up from
65 per cent in June. Activity was heavy in French, German and Dutch
equities. Non-European equity turnover fell, particularly in north American
and Japanese stocks.
Trading in domestic equities remained high, boosted by the BT3 flotation of
the government's final stake in the telephone company. Turnover for the
first seven months was Pounds 305.5bn, 40 per cent more than in the same
period last year.
