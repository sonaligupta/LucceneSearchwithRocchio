FT  21 DEC 92 / Companies take poor view of banks


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY


WORSENING relations between banks and their corporate customers have led a
quarter of UK companies to change bankers in the past five years - more than
half of them in the past two years, a Manchester Business School survey
indicates.
That is an increase in market volatility of two or three times compared with
the mid 1980s.
At the same time, increasing numbers of companies are splitting their
banking, allowing foreign banks to compete for specific business. Only 8 per
cent of companies now use only one bank.
That has enabled US, Japanese and continental European banks to gain a
foothold in 25 per cent of UK corporate accounts.
Those are among the main findings of a detailed survey of banking
relationships by the school's International Centre for Banking and Financial
Services. The survey was of a sample of 670 subscribers to Financial
Director magazine.
The survey reveals widespread dissatisfaction with banks over new fees and
poor quality of service. There was almost universal consensus that the
banks' introduction of customers' charters this year had been largely
useless to business.
The centre's research team, led by Professor Doug Wood, says banks have a
clearer focus on what their competitors are doing than what their clients
are asking for.
The most common complaint was that banks had not passed on interest rate
cuts, using them instead to improve their own margins and leaving struggling
customers in as much trouble as ever.
Only half of those surveyed said they could depend on their bank in a crisis
and only half believed their bank stuck by the spirit of its commitments.
In the sample, Lloyds and NatWest appear to be picking up as many new
customers as they are losing. Barclays emerges as losing share slowly, but
there was a 'quite sharp' drop for Midland.
Net gainers were continental European banks and Bank of Scotland.
