FT  05 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Mitel bounces back
to profit


   By ROBERT GIBBENS

Correction (published 8th November 1993) appended to this article.
MITEL, Ottawa-based maker of switches, semiconductors and other
telecommunications equipment, has continued its recovery with a
second-quarter profit of CDollars 5m (USDollars 3.7m) or 4 cents a share
against a loss of CDollars 3.7m or 6 cents a year earlier on revenues of
CDollars 115m against CDollars 98m.
Six-month earnings were CDollars 8m or 6 cents against a loss of CDollars
10.7m or 16 cents.
British Telecom sold its 51 per cent control of Mitel to Schroders, the UK
merchant bank, for CDollars 40m in June 1992. Schroders has since reduced
its interest.
CORRECTION
A COMPANY advised by Schroder Ventures purchased 51 per cent of Mitel last
year, and not Schroders, the UK merchant bank, as wrongly stated on Friday.
