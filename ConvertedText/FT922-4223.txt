FT  06 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Distrusted trustees


ALTHOUGH MY father died in December 1988, his trustees have still to render
final accounts. Is there a time-limit?
Because the original will went astray in the post, granting of probate was
delayed until October 1989 and, as a consequence, the estate incurred losses
resulting from a slump in the housing market and an increased liability for
rates, community charge, etc and an over-charging of property tax. Can the
trustees be made liable for these losses?
The trustees have invested all monies held in trust for minor beneficiaries
in one building society; but I have been told that only 50 per cent of such
assets may be so invested. What is the present state of the law?
The beneficiaries have sought explanations from the trustees; but without
much result.
There is no formal time limit, but a simple estate should be resolved within
a year of the probate being extracted. The trustees would not normally be
liable for the loss of the will in the post.
The question of what investments are permitted will depend on whether your
father's will contained an express provision enlarging the statutory powers
of investment (it is likely to do so if drawn up by a solicitor). If it does
not, the provisions of the Trustee Investments Act 1961 would apply to limit
to half the fund the amount which may be invested in wider range
investments. This can have the effect of reducing the available return on
investment.
If you are in doubt about the trustees' dealings with the estate, consult a
solicitor.
