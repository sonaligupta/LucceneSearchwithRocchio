FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Sales training behind Refuge Assurance fall


   By ALISON SMITH


Training and testing its 2,100 sales agents contributed to sharp falls in
both regular and single premium business at Refuge Assurance, the life
insurance group, in the first six months of this year.
New regular premium life, annuity and pensions business fell by 31 per cent
to Pounds 13m (Pounds 18.8m), while single premium new business fell 24 per
cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 24.7m).
Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said about half the drop in new business could be
attributed to sales foregone as a result of the extra effort spent on
training and testing, while about half reflected trends within the life
insurance sector as a whole.
There was a particularly marked fall in regular premium new business on the
industrial side - where a sales agent calls once every two weeks or so at
the home of a customer to collect what are often relatively small amounts.
It dropped from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 5.2m.
Refuge said it was raising its interim dividend to 3.7p (3.45p). The cost of
the dividend is Pounds 5.81m. Like other life insurance companies, it is not
required to release interim profits figures.
There were encouraging signs in the group's general insurance underwriting -
where more favourable claims experience helped turn a pre-tax loss of Pounds
1m into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 156,000 - and in unit trust sales which
rose to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 4.6m).
Mr Booth said that though the training exercise had restricted sales in the
first half, there were signs of an improving trend.
Against a background of a reduction in the number of sales agents in the
life industry, he added that Refuge envisaged its sales force remaining at
its current size.
