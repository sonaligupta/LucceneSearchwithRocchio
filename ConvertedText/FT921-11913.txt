FT  29 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM insists recovery is under way -
Economy


   By IVOR OWEN


RECOVERY is already under way in many sectors of the economy, Mr John Major,
the prime minister, claimed in the Commons yesterday, refusing to be
downcast by the findings of the latest Confederation of British Industry
survey.
During prime minister's question time, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal
Democrat leader, recalled a New Year's Day BBC broadcast in which the prime
minister stated: 'In retrospect we will look back and say that economic
recovery has already started.'
Mr Ashdown called for less time 'talking up false economic dawns' and more
time taking action to secure genuine economic recovery.
Mr Major insisted: 'When we look back at the present time it will be
perfectly clear that in many sectors of the economy the recovery has indeed
started.'
Both the prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, were accused
by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, of misleading the
country over the extent of the recession, and of failing to take recovery
measures.
