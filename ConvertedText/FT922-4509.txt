FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: BBC is good value at twice the price


   From Mr VINCENT SINCLAIR


Sir, Like most of the public services dear to our hearts, the BBC is
hopelessly underfunded, as illustrated by Christopher Dunkley ('Spitting
contest for grown men', May 27). Compared with the potential cost of viewing
football on satellite, the licence fee is peanuts. We should be thankful for
the standard the BBC maintains on our behalf for such a meagre annual
contribution. What are the government's intentions in constantly undermining
the BBC's capacity to produce? I doubt if they reflect the views of the
population. The BBC is a bargain but the corporation as we know it is under
progressive threat. It should be left alone. Double the licence fee and it
would still be good value.
