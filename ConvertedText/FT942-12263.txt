FT  30 APR 94 / Invesco reduces unit trust charge in quest for clients


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


Invesco, the fund management group, is to cut the initial charge across the
range of its unit trusts from the industry norm of 5.25 per cent to 3 per
cent from Tuesday.
The move signifies further competition in the unit trust market, which has
so far concentrated its energies on price-cutting in tax-free personal
equity plans.
Mr Alan Wren, managing director of Invesco fund managers, said the decision
was 'purely commercial' with the intention being to grab greater market
share and attract longer-term investors.
He said that in the past two years Invesco's funds under management in the
UK had barely grown compared with a market average growth of between 50 per
cent and 100 per cent. The group had Pounds 1.26bn funds under management in
the UK at the end of last December, according to the Association of Unit and
Investment Funds. Two years ago it was one of the 10 largest fund managers
in the UK but is now just outside the top 20.
Invesco has been dogged by adverse publicity in Britain. This has undermined
the group's ability to attract clients and culminated last year in a fine of
Pounds 750,000 imposed by Imro, the self-regulating body for investment
management.
Imro and the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator,
acknowledged that the group had taken steps to change its management and to
implement compliance procedures that should prevent a repetition of rule
breaches.
Twenty senior executives left the company last year, and it is still in the
process of administrative reorganisation and withdrawal from areas other
than the core business of fund management.
This month it reported sharply improved pre-tax profits for the year to the
end of December of Pounds 33.4m, against Pounds 12.6m the previous year.
