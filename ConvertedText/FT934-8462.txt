FT  16 NOV 93 / Brussels clears telecoms venture


   By ANDREW HILL


THE European Commission has cleared a joint venture between 12 of the
world's largest telecommunications groups, aimed at providing specialised
communication services between financial centres.
But the Financial Network Association, which includes six European
companies, had to give special undertakings that it would not discriminate
against private service suppliers. The FNA also undertook not to use revenue
from 'reserved' monopoly services to subsidise services such as data
transmission, which are already open to competition.
The FNA, set up in March 1992, will offer worldwide services to financial
institutions through the networks of the companies involved. They are:
France Telecom, Belgacom, the Belgian state telecoms company, Italcable of
Italy, Mercury Communications of the UK, Telfonica of Spain, Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom of Germany, Telstra of Australia, Hong Kong Telecom, KDD
of Japan, MCI of the US, Singapore Telecom and Stentor of Canada.
