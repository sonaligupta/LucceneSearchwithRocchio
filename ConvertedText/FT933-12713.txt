FT  22 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dunhill falls


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


A profits warning from Dunhill, the luxury goods and tobacco group, sent the
shares reeling and also impacted on Rothmans. Dunhill chairman Lord Douro
told the agm that a 'convincing recovery' would be now needed in markets
such as Japan to avoid a significant reduction in the company's operating
profits this year. The recovery under way in the UK and US was described as
being 'only hesitant'.
Dunhill shares closed 17 down at 340p. Rothmans fell 10 to 670p. On a
brighter note, shareholders learnt that plans to restructure Dunhill,
Rothmans and Richemont to create the Vendome luxury goods group are on
track, with meetings to vote on the proposals set for September.
Under the reconstruction, the three groups will split their tobacco and
luxury goods businesses into two new quoted companies, Vendome and Rothmans.
International trading group Hanson shed a penny to 234p after the company
said the strike at its Peabody mining subsidiary would cost Pounds 29m for
the three months to the end of June.
Lonrho firmed 1 1/2 to 130 1/2 p after the group said it had agreed the sale
of its 50 per cent stake in German metals trading concern Krupp Lonrho for
DM282.5m. The company said the proceeds were to be used to reduce debt.
Brokers' recommendations helped BAT Industries shake off Tuesday's gloom
that led to a retreat after Philip Morris, its US rival, confirmed that
provisional price cuts made earlier this year were to be extended to other
premium brands.
The shares bounced 7 to 437p in trade of 4.4m, with both NatWest Securities
and Strauss Turnbull said to be positive on the stock.
Among oil issues, volume in Lasmo jumped to 10m after a series of agency
crosses during the afternoon. The day's turnover included two large crosses
at 135 1/2 p, and a smaller block of around 500,000 that was dealt at 138p.
The shares continued to recover and closed 3 1/2 up at 137 1/2 p.
In the rest of the oil sector, fears of an oil glut continued to dampen
enthusiasm for Shell Transport, which slipped a further 5 to 603p. However,
bargain hunters lifted British Petroleum into positive territory and it
closed a penny firmer at 288p after trade of 5.8m shares.
A positive rating upgrade by a UK stockbroker helped Cable and Wireless rise
sharply in early trade before the shares faded away to close unchanged at
759p. BZW added Pounds 20m to its current year forecast, lifting it to
Pounds 1.035bn, and attributed this to strong trading in its key markets.
Slight disappointment at the lack of trading news at Vodafone's annual
meeting left the shares 7 cheaper at 436p.
The recommendation from Lehman Brothers made earlier this week continued to
boost Reuters ahead of next week's figures. The shares moved 16 higher to
1408p.
Container rental group Tiphook dropped another 16 to 197p as dealers
continued to fret about the company's financial position. Tiphook announced
losses last week after changing the way it reported its figures.
National Express moved forward 8 to 223p after confirming its planned
acquisition of East Midlands Airport. The company, however, warned that its
coach operating business was trading below expectations following a poor
response to fare changes and aggressive pricing by British Rail.
Agm talk of an improving trend, albeit tempered by some concern over
international economic prospects, left Pilkington a penny easier at 131p.
Pre-results nerves bit into Reed International, which lost 6 to close at
640p. The company is due to declare its interims in a fortnight's time.
Anglo-Dutch foods group Unilever advanced, helped by a BZW buy note, before
fading to finish 2 down on balance at 947p.
Continued worries about the funding of British Aerospace's regional jets
joint venture with Taiwan further depressed BAe shares, which ended 12
weaker at 388p after volume of 1.8m.
Strong demand for VSEL ahead of today's annual meeting saw the shares
strengthen 27 to 890p.
Worse than expected figures at a US rival led to selling of shares in
engineering group Siebe, which finished 7 lighter at 485p but above the
day's worst.
A change of recommendation from Smith New Court from buy to hold in BICC
left the shares 8 down at 398p, while it was profit-taking that was said to
be responsible for a decline in Powell Duffryn of 10 to 541p.
Television stocks refused to bow to the market's malaise and turned in
creditable performances. Anglia TV was star of the show with an advance of
13 to 325p. It also benefited from a buy recommendation from NatWest
Securities - the only television stock to do so in an anaylst's note which
reported a slight increase in advertising revenue last month against
expectations of a small decline.
Central TV moved up 10 to 1958p; Grampian 'A' added 3 at 227p;
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV gained 3 at 198p and Scottish TV put on 2 at 516p.
Carlton Communications was the only stock to slip, relinquishing 5 to 730p.
Ground lost in the UK newspaper tabloid price wars continued to be clawed
back by United Newspapers, which added a penny at 522p on the back of the
success of its recent rights issue.
The newspaper group, which publishes the Daily Express and Daily Star,
announced that its rights issue was 95.7 per cent taken up.
