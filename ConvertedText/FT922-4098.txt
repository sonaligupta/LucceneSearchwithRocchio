FT  08 JUN 92 / The exchange rate as a distorting price control


   By MARTIN WOLF


THE RESULT of the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty throws greater
doubt on the prospects for economic and monetary union. If Emu is less
likely, hopes of European monetary stability depend on the durability of the
ERM. It has survived without a general realignment for almost 5 1/2 years.
Can it continue to do so?
The underlying rationale for reliance on a fixed exchange rate as a means of
controlling inflation is 'the law of one price'. This states that goods and
services that compete closely with one another cannot sell for very
different prices. Since the proportion of the economy open to international
competition in the larger European countries would amount to about a third,
the ERM should be viewed as basically a selective price control.
Yet it appears to be an effective one. Consider producer prices, which are
the best indicator of the prices of tradable goods. The top section of the
chart shows that since January 1987, the Ecu-denominated producer prices of
Germany, France and Italy, all members of the ERM throughout that period,
have moved together closely. By contrast, those of Spain, which joined in
June 1989, and the UK, which joined in October 1990, deviated considerably,
as exchange rates shifted.
Convergence of producer prices is not an iron law, especially over shorter
periods. The small inset in the top section shows that since October 1990
producer prices have fallen by some 5 per cent in France, but risen by
slightly more than that in the UK. For the UK, this does mean a disturbing
loss of competitiveness.
A partial price control is likely to create distortions: the more effective
the price control, the more serious the distortions. Among symptoms of too
low a relative price - and so profitability - of tradable vis a vis
non-tradable output (a relationship also known as the real exchange rate)
might be a current account deficit during a recession, as in the UK today.
An indication of the shifts in the relative prices of non-tradable goods and
services vis a vis those for tradable goods and services is the movement in
consumer prices, which includes marketed services, as against producer
prices.
German producer prices in Ecus rose 12 per cent between January 1987 and
March 1992, while its consumer prices rose 16 per cent, for a relative rise
in consumer prices of only 3 per cent.
UK producer prices had risen 31 per cent by March 1992, while consumer
prices had risen 40 per cent, for a relative price rise of 7 per cent.
French producer prices had risen only 6 per cent by the last quarter of
1991, while consumer prices had risen 14 per cent, for a relative price rise
of 8 per cent.
Italian producer prices had risen 13 per cent by January 1992, while
consumer prices had risen 27 per cent, for a relative price rise of 13 per
cent. Finally,
Spanish producer prices had risen 24 per cent by February 1992, while
consumer prices had soared 52 per cent, for a relative price rise of 22 per
cent.
Judged by Ecu producer prices, the UK has suffered the largest loss of
competitiveness since 1987. But Spain, followed by Italy, has suffered from
the largest apparent distortion in its internal relative prices. Even so the
data do not demonstrate this distortion. A country with relatively high
productivity growth in tradable output would experience a sharper rise in
the relative prices of non-tradable goods and services. The same would
happen to a country with large net capital inflows.
Productivity growth is definitely not an adequate explanation for what has
happened to Italy, where productivity in manufacturing has grown more slowly
than in France and Germany in recent years. By contrast, both productivity
growth in manufacturing and capital inflows have been relatively high in
Spain.
The nominal exchange rate is just a partial price control and, like any
price control, can create internal distortions. In Italy, and perhaps Spain
as well, it seems to be doing precisely that, with ominous implications for
exchange rate stability.
