FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Cost reductions help lift SCA by
72%

SCA, Sweden's second-largest pulp and paper group, said the weaker krona,
cost reductions, and increased volumes helped push up profits by 72 per
cent, to SKr271m (Dollars 37.2m), in the first quarter of 1993.
Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, president, said the group's most important markets,
particularly Germany, were still weak. Prices remained under pressure for
most products, excluding lightweight coated paper.
However, the company is sticking to its earlier forecast of full-year
profits in the range of SKr1bn to SKr1.5bn.
Sales rose 8 per cent to SKr8.58bn from SKr7.98bn, reflecting beneficial
currency movements and volume growth. Operating profit eased to SKr523m from
SKr531m following last year's disposal of energy operations. This, however,
was more than offset by a drop in financial costs, from SKr373m to SKr252m.
The group said all but one of its four main business units improved
earnings. Graphic paper operations made a profit for the first time in five
quarters, posting a SKr37m operating surplus after last year's SKr74m loss.
The unit benefited from cost reductions and the stronger dollar, which
reduced exports of newsprint from North America to Europe.
The company's hygiene division, Molnlycke, had another strong quarter, with
profits rising 82 per cent to SKr311m.
The packaging division saw operating profit rise to SKr153m from SKr114m.
