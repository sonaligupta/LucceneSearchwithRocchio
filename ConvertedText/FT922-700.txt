FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: Where analysis on pensions went awry


   From Mr LAWLESS BETHUNE


Sir, Reading your editorial of June 20 ('Pensions after Maxwell'), I agreed
with much of what you said. The law does need tightening to protect pension
scheme beneficiaries from rapacious or dishonest employers. In some places,
however, your analysis goes awry.
Take cross subsidy, for example. You attack its use in final salary
arrangements, but only a few sentences earlier you advocate it for a
compensation scheme. In both cases, surely, risks are being shared and some
participants will inevitably subsidise others?
You conclude by suggesting that personal pensions would be the solution. For
some people they are, but only rarely is a personal pension an individual
portfolio of assets. The overwhelming majority are invested with insurance
companies, which pool all the premiums to operate massive cross subsidy.
You have in the past criticised insurers for overselling their products and
penalising people who back out early, even through no fault of their own. Is
it really the answer to demolish employers' schemes and move millions of
employees into insurance policies? Presumably you would also want the civil
servants' own scheme switched into personal pensions?
