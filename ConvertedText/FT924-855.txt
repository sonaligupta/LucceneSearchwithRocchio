FT  22 DEC 92 / Owen clinches demilitarisation accord


   By REUTER


   SARAJEVO


EUROPEAN Community peace negotiator Lord Owen has hammered out a plan for
demilitarising the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo after four days of
shuttle diplomacy among warring factions around the city, Reuter reports
from Sarajevo.
'I think we've laid a framework for demilitarising Sarajevo. . . no doubt
there will be many upsets and difficulties along the way, but we have agreed
now on a structure,' he said after nearly three hours of talks with Bosnian
Serbs in Lukavica, near Sarajevo.
Lord Owen has persuaded Moslem, Serb and Croat factions to create four
problem-solving working committees.
Among the issues to be addressed are demilitarising an area around Sarajevo
airport, restoring utilities, creating joint police patrols in divided
neighbourhoods and giving humanitarian aid
Each committee would co-ordinate its activities with an existing body known
as the mixed military working group, Dr Owen said.
Local military commanders have often scuttled ceasefire agreements and
blocked UN efforts to repair utilities and humanitarian aid convoys.
UN relief workers restarted their airlift of emergency aid to Sarajevo
yesterday after a three-week break caused by fighting.
