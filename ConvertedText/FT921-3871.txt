FT  12 MAR 92 / UK Company News: European advertising fall behind 19% drop
at Aegis


   By ROLAND RUDD


AEGIS GROUP, Europe's biggest media-buying concern, yesterday reported a 19
per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, the first
full-year profit decline since it went public eight years ago.
Mr Peter Scott, chairman, blamed the fall in profits - from Pounds 67.8m to
Pounds 55.2m - on the 1 per cent fall in European advertising expenditure,
the worst performance for a decade. This was mainly due to the effects of
the Gulf war.
In the face of difficult trading conditions Aegis is only predicting 2 per
cent growth this year.
While the group completed the main elements of its building programme,
started in 1988, operating costs rose from Pounds 87.2m to Pounds 120.5m in
the period. Some Pounds 19m of the rise came from acquisitions, mergers and
new business start-ups.
The operating companies of Carat, the Paris-based buying group, have been
integrated into a single European network with 50 offices in 18 countries
and a new central management structure has been put in place.
Turnover rose to Pounds 2.11bn (Pounds 1.72bn), mainly on the back of
acquisitions. Earnings per share fell to 21.11p (37.35p) basic and to 18.23p
(25.62p) fully diluted.
During the year the group paid vendors of acquired companies deferred and
contingent cash payments of Pounds 25m.
The total amount outstanding to be paid to vendors of acquired companies in
cash and shares is Pounds 81m, against Pounds 118m in 1990.
A proposed final dividend of 3.1p makes an unchanged total of 5.85p.
COMMENT
Following the group's warning last December the pre-tax profits fall is in
line with expectations. Given the depressed state of the market, there is
some truth to the group's claim that it has produced 'robust results'. Yet
since the fall in European advertising expenditure was no surprise, it is
disappointing to find a Pounds 33.3m increase in operating costs. Even if
Pounds 19.3m was due to acquisitions, overhead costs are still too high.
While the group is determined to bring those costs down - it says it is
investigating the scope for redundancies - it is also committed to buying in
its minorities which could make the task harder. Aegis expects competitive
pressures to continue which will put more pressure on margins. The City
expects full-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m, giving earnings of 13.7p.
This puts the shares, up 1p at 114p, on a prospective multiple of 8.3,
reflecting some uncertainty over this year's profits.
