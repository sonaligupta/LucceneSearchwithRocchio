FT  16 NOV 93 / Harvesting profit from set-aside


   By ALISON MAITLAND


A CROP of willow coppice, which is being grown to make productive use of
set-aside land, is cleared by Mr Neil Roberts (above), manager of
Ingerthorpe Hall Farm, near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Alison Maitland
writes.
The farm is growing 70 acres of willow and poplar. The crops can be used to
provide wood chips for burning in combined heat and power systems and for
use in paper pulp. The young wood is coppiced, or cut frequently, to
increase the harvest.
Under last year's reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy arable farmers
are required to leave 15 per cent of their land uncultivated to cut
overproduction.
The policy is expected to cost the taxpayer Pounds 130m in payments to
British farmers this year and is resented by many producers, who dislike
seeing their land idle. Set-aside payments to farmers across the European
Union are due to rise to about Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 930m) in 1995.
