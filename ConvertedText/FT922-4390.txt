FT  05 JUN 92 / Senate defeats bid to cut TV funding

CONSERVATIVE attempts to cut federal funding for non-commercial radio and TV
in the US have been defeated in the Senate. On Wednesday night, the Senate
passed, by 84-11, a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 610m) three-year authorisation for
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, having earlier rejected by 75-22 a
proposal to freeze funding at present levels.
As a concession to conservatives, the bill stipulates that 'indecent
programming' should in most cases only be broadcast after midnight.
The argument this time was that it was wrong to subsidise programmes for the
US elite while the general watchword was budgetary austerity. Senator Trent
Lott (Republican, Mississippi), charged that the funding bill 'clearly
amounts, for the most part, to an upper-middle-class entitlement programme.'
The standard fare on non-commercial TV runs heavily to British imported
drama, interspersed with current affairs, political talk shows, and arguably
the best nightly news show: the MacNeil-Lehrer Report.
Few non-commercial stations make their own programmes, many surviving on
federal funds and subscription drives. Even supporters of public
broadcasting concede the system is not cost-effective. But public
broadcasting has strong backing in Washington.
