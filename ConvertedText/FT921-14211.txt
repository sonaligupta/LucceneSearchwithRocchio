FT  17 JAN 92 / Lilley visit to boost UK-Mexico trade


   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT


MR Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, starts a visit to
Mexico on Monday, at the head of a business delegation to take advantage of
what he calls the 'remarkable developments. . . over the last few years with
the freeing of markets through trade and investment liberalisation,
deregulation and privatisation'.
One aim will be to increase UK trade with Mexico, which with exports in 1990
of Pounds 262m and imports of Pounds 172m lags considerably behind the US,
other EC countries and Japan. In addition, Mr Lilley intends to discuss the
implications of the North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US,
Canada and Mexico, which subject to approval by the US Senate should come
into force this year.
Also on the agenda will be the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
On this subject, Mr Lilley said that Mexico and the UK 'tended to see
eye-to-eye' with a view to completing the round - whose negotiators are
studying Gatt's final and comprehensive proposals - as soon as possible.
