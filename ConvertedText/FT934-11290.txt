FT  02 NOV 93 / Iraqi N-arms 'neutralised'


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


IRAQ'S clandestine nuclear weapons programme has either been destroyed or
neutralised, with no 'big pieces' missing, Dr Hans Blix, head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, said yesterday, Reuter reports from New
York.
Dr Blix told the UN General Assembly that after 21 inspection missions gaps
still had to be filled in about Iraq's nuclear supply channels and sources
of scientific information. But, at a news conference following his speech,
he said: 'Through a piecing together of the evidence we have found, we have
a consistent and coherent picture of the nuclear programme. There are no big
pieces missing.'
He said declared non-irradiated highly-enriched uranium had been removed in
November 1991 and a schedule set up to remove declared irradiated
highly-enriched uranium.
Iraq has not yet agreed to a long-term monitoring programme to ensure it
does not reacquire weapons of mass destruction.
