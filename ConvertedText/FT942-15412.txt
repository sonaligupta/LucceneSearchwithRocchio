FT  15 APR 94 / Ulster to get 485 engineering jobs


A Pounds 45m investment announced yesterday by FG Wilson Engineering will
create 485 jobs at Larne, Northern Ireland, by the end of 1996.
The company, which is already in the process of transferring manufacturing
capacity from Newtonabbey and Craig-avon to the former GEC-Alsthom plant at
Larne, said the investment is based on a big increase on export sales,
particularly in the Middle East and Far East.
