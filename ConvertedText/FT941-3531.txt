FT  16 MAR 94 / Mexican financier kidnapped


   By TED BARDACKE


   MEXICO CITY


The head of Mexico's largest financial group has disappeared in what police
are treating as a kidnapping.
Eyewitnesses said Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, president of Banamex-Accival, was
intercepted by armed men on Monday as he was being driven to work in Mexico
City.
The kidnappers have yet to make public their demands but have been in
contact with the Harp family, according to the police. The family has been
told not to co-operate with police authorities or make statements to the
press.
When news of Mr Harp's disappearance reached the Mexico City stock market,
Banacci B shares fell sharply, closing on Monday down 3.86 per cent on very
heavy volume. Shares continued to slide yesterday.
The New York security firm Kroll Associates confirmed it had been asked to
handle the case, but would offer no more information. Kroll won the release
of two businessmen kidnapped in 1992.
Kidnappers have targeted Mexican businessmen with increasing frequency with
over 2,000 kidnappings reported in the past five years. A source close to
the investigation said: 'It appears to be the work of a professional group.'
