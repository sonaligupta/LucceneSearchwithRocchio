FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: N West Water rises


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


North West Water's surprise move in proposing an enhanced scrip dividend at
a level 50 per cent above the cash dividend equivalent saw its stock price
race ahead, triggering a general advance in the water sector as dealers
quickly decided that other water companies may propose similar schemes.
Shares in North West, the first water company to report preliminary figures,
climbed 7 to 487p on heavy turnover of 4.6m after the scrip news,
preliminary results and 9 per cent increase in the dividend. Dividend
increases averaging 9 per cent have been forecast for the sector by
utilities specialists. Turnover was boosted by a block of 1.3m shares
thought to have been sold in special ex-dividend form.
Some analysts, however, cast doubts on whether other water companies will
follow the path of enhanced scrip offerings. 'For companies such as North
West, which has an aggressive expansion programme, this is a good move, but
the only other water company which fits the bill is Thames,' was the view of
one analyst.
Thames shares rose 7 to 508p, but heavily underperformed smaller capitalised
companies such as Southern, up 16 1/2 at 497p, and South West, reporting
today, 13 higher at 520p.
