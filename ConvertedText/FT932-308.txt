FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tarmac wanted


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Tarmac, the building materials and housebuilding group, attracted much
heavier than usual turnover of 6.4m amid a mixture of revived takeover
speculation and talk of profits upgrades and broker buy recommendations.
Bid speculation again centred on Minorco, the mining and minerals group
which comes under the control of Harry Oppenheimer's Anglo American/De Beers
umbrella, but was largely dismissed by building analysts.
Dealers said Cazenove, Tarmac's stockbroker, had turned a buyer of the
shares and increased its earnings forecasts for the company, although this
was not confirmed; Cazenove has a policy of not commenting on client
business. Tarmac shares settled 7 higher at 141p.
Northern Electric took up the running in the regional electricity sector's
'dividend race' increasing its annual payout by 15.6 per cent, the highest
so far in the sector. Northern shares jumped 6 to 514p on the news.
Seeboard, due to announce preliminary figures this morning and where the
dividend is confidently expected to rise by around 15 per cent to 19.8p,
moved up 7 to 510p. Eastern, reporting tomorrow, edged up 4 to 461p,
Southern, due on Thursday and expected to mount a strong challenge in the
dividend stakes, jumped 11 to 463p. London Electricity, reporting Friday,
gained 7 to 454p.
Although losses from Airtours were in line with market expectations,
investors were cheered by the group's recent aggressive acquisitive run
which yesterday culminated in the Pounds 20m purchase of a Welsh tour
operator. This follows the recent purchase of Hogg Robinson's retail
division and of the Pickford's chain.
However, the company were said to be looking to limiting analysts' upgrades
which were including the most profitable period for the new acquisitions.
Brokers were moving from profit forecasts of around Pounds 35m to Pounds
45m, buoyed by firm summer bookings and less talk of discounting. The shares
added 6 to 334p.
Other groups in the holiday sector also shone in sympathy. Owners Abroad,
which Airtours failed to land earlier this year, rose a penny to 98p, Euro
Disney 15 to 810p and Eurocamp 4 to 227p.
Weekend press comment over the business strategy at Thorn EMI helped the
shares gain 8 to 915p.
A profits downgrade by Hoare Govett saw Abbey National drift back 2 to 408p.
Hoare was said to have chopped its current year estimate from Pounds 670m to
Pounds 640m.
Barclays, on the other hand, edged up 4 to 470p with the bank thought to be
about to announce the name of its new chief executive. HSBC added 13 at 667p
following a strong performance by the Hong Kong stockmarket.
Royal Insurance was the pick of the composite insurers, the shares extending
their recent strong performance and moving further ahead to close 6 higher
at 304p.
Lowndes Lambert, due to announce preliminary figures this morning, rose 6 to
a record 379p.
A dull food retail sector was also put off by a rumour that one leading
securities house was considering downgrading the whole sector on the back of
low food price inflation. A combination of a broker downgrade, negative
press comment and profit-taking sent Asda retreating 2 1/2 to 72 1/2 p.
Tesco was said to be the subject of a downgrade from James Capel. The
company also issued a statement denying press speculation of a boardroom
rift. The shares firmed a half-penny to 215 1/2 p.
The surge in Great Universal Stores on the back of enfranchisement hopes
continued with the 'A' shares gaining 17 to 1780p.
There was talk of a pick-up in DIY sales in recent months. Kingfisher, owner
of the B&Q chain, added 3 to 607p, as did Do It All partner WH Smith to
429p, while Boots gained 4 to 454p. Ladbroke, which runs Texas, climbed 3 to
179p.
In a quiet drinks sector, Grand Metropolitan benefited from a recommendation
in a US investment magazine. The shares added 5 to 434p. Comment on the
Greenalls bid for Devenish saw the former climb 4 to 358p and the latter
steady at 366p.
A confident statement from WPP raised its price by a penny to close at 87p
with 1.3m shares traded. Shareholders at the annual meeting heard that the
group was well poised to take advantage of a recovery and its worldwide
revenue in constant currencies was up 5 per cent over the past five months.
One media analyst said that it was the most bullish statement by the
advertising group in quite some time.
Elsewhere in media agencies, Acsis Group suspended its shares after their
steady drift had sent the price down to 1 1/4 p. It said it would make a
statement on refinancing and restructuring next month.
Witan Investment edged up 2 to equal the 1993 high of 197p following an
agency cross of around 7m shares, executed by Panmure Gordon, the
stockbroker, at 197p. Henderson Investment Trust Management issued a net
asset value of 226.4p a share for Witan.
DC Gardner shares jumped 10 to 51p after the egm voted to approve the
reorganisation moves.
IMI, meanwhile dropped 5 to 278p after a series of profits downgrades
instigated by a number of broking houses. Carr Kitcat & Aitken lowered their
current year estimate from Pounds 72m to Pounds 68m.
British Aerospace, where the shares were poor performers and down around 6
per cent last week, staged a good rally, closing 7 higher at 395p as the
market adopted a more positive attitude to hopes of the sale of Tornado
aircraft to South Korea.
In the transport area, British Airports Authority jumped 18 to 731p after
talk of buy notes issued by James Capel and UBS.
The day's two debut stocks, Metrotect and Enviromed, kept up the run of
strong performances by market newcomers. Metrotect, the plastics group,
closed at 133p after turnover of 4.1m shares, while Enviromed settled at an
8p premium to its placing price of 110p.
