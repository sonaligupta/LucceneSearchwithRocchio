FT  02 JUL 92 / Russians warned over spending

MR Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, yesterday warned Russia was
again spending more than it could afford, as deputies threatened to cut
taxes
Although a revised 1992 budget increasing the consolidated budget deficit to
Rbs308bn, 2 per cent of GNP, sailed through a first reading yesterday,
parliament plans today to pass a law to slash an unpopular value added tax
from 28 to 14 per cent.
Mr Gaidar warned that such a cut in a central source of income would force
reductions in agricultural and military spending and would 'destabilise
society'.
But Mr Alexander Pochinok, head of the budget committee, accused the
government of underestimating revenues.
Russian authorities also introduced a new controlled exchange rate of
Rbs125.26 to the dollar instead of floating the currency at a market rate as
they had originally planned.
