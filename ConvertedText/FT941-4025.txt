FT  12 MAR 94 / US says landing rights row settled


Britain will pay the Dollars 29.5m (Pounds 20.2m) damages to settle a
dispute over fees charged to US airlines landing at London's Heathrow
airport, the Department of Transportation in Washington announced last
night.
The department said the agreement settled a long dispute over fees at the
airport between 1983 and 1989. It said Britain had agreed to change the
charging system at Heathrow to make it fairer to US carriers.
The settlement was reached after an international arbitration panel ruled
that Britain had failed to use its best efforts to ensure that charges at
Heathrow were just and reasonable. It concludes years of negotiations and
litigation.
Britain also agreed to drop claims it had filed against the US over charges
at US airports. The US agreed to encourage its airports to consult with
airline users in setting their fees.
