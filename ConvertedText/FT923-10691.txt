FT  29 JUL 92 / Ogata tries to persuade world to face the facts


   By ROBERT MAUTHNER and FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


MRS SADAKO OGATA, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will today
preside over one of the most important conferences in a life largely devoted
to the promotion of human rights.
The aim of the conference, to be attended by 31 nations, is to tackle the
problem of the rapidly growing number of refugees from the former
Yugoslavia, now totalling nearly 3.2m including those trapped in Bosnia.
At a time when the military situation on the ground is daily making their
situation worse and many neighbouring countries are already claiming they
are saturated with Bosnian refugees, Mrs Ogata, a 64-year-old Japanese
professor of international relations who has held her current post for less
than two years, is the first to admit the task is momentous.
She is nothing if not realistic. No, Mrs Ogata is not proposing any specific
solutions to the refugee crisis. 'In general, when you call a conference you
spend several months or even a year to prepare it and a solution.
So this is more of an emergency conference to alert the world about what is
happening. What I am proposing is not a solution, but a follow-up mechanism
to assess needs and how to deal with them.'
Stressing that neither funds nor emergency supplies could provide a
long-term solution to the refugee crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the High
Commissioner says it is up to the participating governments to find
political solutions. 'I would hope that the magnitude of the humanitarian
solutions and some information on the implication of what is happening might
provide governments with the urgent desire to overcome the problem.'
Mrs Ogata is decidedly unenthusiastic about proposals that countries should
agree to a refugee quota system to answer the complaints of those, like
Germany, who have criticised their European Community partners for not
accepting their fair share of Yugoslav, and particularly Bosnian refugees.
The view of the UNHCR, the organisation which she directs, is that those
fleeing the region to 'adjacent countries', such as Austria and Hungary,
should be offered 'temporary protection' by the host country, instead of
being put through the normal political asylum interrogation procedure. 'What
the refugees want is to be taken into a safe area temporarily. There may be
people who are seeking permanent asylum, but what we are asking for is for
the countries to give them authorisation for a temporary stay.'
This, Mrs Ogata points out, is completely different from a quota system,
which never offers protection to anything like the number of people who are
seeking it. 'If you end up taking 100,000, what happens to the rest of the
people?'
Though recognising fully that most refugees want to remain either in their
own country or somewhere close to home, Mrs Ogata is sceptical about the
feasibility of creating 'safe havens' on the Iraqi Kurdish model. That would
be complicated in a country where the ethnic communities are so widely
dispersed and it might encourage, rather than prevent, the 'ethnic
cleansing' process employed by the Bosnian Serbs.
Moreover, who would protect the safe areas? Already overstretched, the UN
would end up having to expand its peace-keeping forces even more.
'I would hope that the increased presence of international humanitarian
workers like our own would be one way of ensuring a certain safety (for the
population in a region). In the past, though we do not have very many people
 -about 60 including local staff in Yugoslavia as a whole - the fact that
they have moved around has, in certain instances, prevented expulsions. An
enhanced activity of that sort is very fragile, but nevertheless something
of a safe area infrastructure.'
Mrs Ogata admits that the crisis in Yugoslavia is going to cost 'an enormous
amount of money'. But she does not think there is a funding crisis. Part of
the money needed will be provided through contributions to the UNHCR, via
the UN system. But a substantial proportion of the requirements would have
to be supplied through bilateral arrangements between governments and the
refugee organisation.
The High Commissioner justified her sanguine view of funding by pointing to
last year's Kurdish crisis. 'We appealed and we were almost fully funded. We
received and spent some Dollars 220m for bringing back and providing winter
accommodation for 1.7m Kurds.'
Since the UNHCR's latest appeal in May, the organisation has already
received a little more than Dollars 107m out of an estimated requirement for
Dollars 142m. A good part of the amount received - Dollars 70m - came from
the European Community. 'It shows that the issues are European. Europe has
to take the initiative in this. It took a little while, but it is coming
now.'
Mrs Ogata hoped today's conference would lead to the setting up of a good
system of assessing the needs arising out of the Yugoslav refugee crisis, as
well as an examination of possible solutions such as the proposals for
refugee quotas and 'safe havens'.
Her own idea is to send an assessment mission to the region and she hopes
governments attending today's meeting will join this project. 'In three to
four weeks we should be able to come up with a pretty good paper on what the
needs are, while we carry on day-to-day operations. I hope that we might
even be able to come up with some kind of proposal for a solution of the
refugee crisis in that time span.'
But ever realistically cautious, she adds: 'That's my hope. There can be no
assurance.'
