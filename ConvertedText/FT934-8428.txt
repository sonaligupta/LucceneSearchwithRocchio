FT  16 NOV 93 / Computer services centre in Scotland


HOSKYNS, the computer services company which provides information technology
services, is to set up a business process centre at Forres, in Moray,
Grampian.
The centre expects to employ 200 people within two years. It will cost
Pounds 3.2m, of which Pounds 1.5m is coming from Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the development body. The centre will be linked to clients via
the Highlands' advanced telecommunications network. It will carry out some
council tax administration for Grampian Regional Council and Moray District
Council, and is hoping to attract work from other local authorities,
insurance companies and businesses with a big administrative load.
