FT  16 DEC 94 / Peugeot workers reject pay offer


More than 2,500 car workers at Peugeot Talbot's Coventry plant will be
balloted in the new year on industrial action after rejecting a two-year pay
deal by almost four to one.
The staff, members of the TGWU, were offered 3.5 per cent in the first year
of the deal and 4 per cent - or the rate of inflation, if higher - in 1996.
One area of disagreement is over compensation for loss of premium payments
after the Ryton plant's recent move to a double day-shift pattern, with work
starting at 6am and 2pm.
