FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Electronics drives rise at
Rockwell


Rockwell International, the US aerospace-to-electronics group, lifted
second-quarter net income to Dollars 154.7m, an increase of 13 per cent over
the Dollars 136.9m of the corresponding period.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman and chief executive officer, said: 'Earnings per
share for the second quarter were 70 cents, up 11 per cent over last year's
63 cents per share, marking the fifth consecutive quarter Rockwell has
recorded a double-digit increase of earnings per share.'
Sales for the second quarter rose to Dollars 2.76bn, up Dollars 67m from the
same fiscal 1993 period.
Mr Beall attributed the strong 1994 second-quarter results primarily to
record quarterly earnings at the largest business segment, elec-tronics.
Automotive, aerospace and graphics earnings were also ahead of last year's
comparable period.
For the first six months, net income was Dollars 304.2m, a 15 per cent
increase over 1993's first-half net income of Dollars 264.7m.
Earnings per share were Dollars 1.38, up 14 per cent over 1993's Dollars
1.21. Sales totalled Dollars 5.4bn, against Dollars 5.2bn a year ago.
