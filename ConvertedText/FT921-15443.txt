FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Dewhurst improves in second half


The rate of profit decline at Dewhurst was arrested in the second half as
profitability showed improvement in difficult trading conditions.
The group, which makes electrical control equipment, saw pre-tax profits
fall 37 per cent, from Pounds 1.02m to Pounds 643,000, in the year to
September 29 1991, after being nearly 64 per cent adrift at the halfway
stage.
Sales slipped from Pounds 7.85m to Pounds 7.81m. With no signs of
significant revival in the UK economy the difficult conditions were likely
to persist this year, directors said.
Earnings per share worked through at 4.03p (5.99p). The proposed final
dividend is 1.2p for a total of 1.8p (1.7p).
