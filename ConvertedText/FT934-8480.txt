FT  15 NOV 93 / French students plan mass protest

   PARIS


FRANCE'S student unions are planning a series of nationwide demonstrations
today to protest against conditions in universities and a shortage of
teachers.
The biggest protests are expected in Paris where students plan to march from
the Sorbonne university to the National Assembly where a debate on the
proposed 1994 higher education budget is scheduled. Demonstrations are also
expected in other cities, including Strasbourg and Bordeaux.
Student unions claim that the budget, which is set to rise by 6 per cent
over the budget for 1993, is inadequate. They are also angry about the
government's decision in June to cut spending on equipment in universities
by 40 per cent from the level outlined in plans announced last autumn.
Mr Francois Fillon, minister for higher education, said his department had
received one of the largest increases under the proposed budget for next
year, demonstrating the priority given to education by the centre-right
government of Mr Edouard Balladur.
The planned protests come at a sensitive time for the government which is
also faced with the prospect of strikes at several public sector companies
later this week. Unions have called for protests on Thursday against job
losses and the government's planned reform of the labour law.
