FT  27 MAY 93 / BBC faces new efficiency test


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE BBC is to face another government check on its efficiency before its
licence fee is set for next year.
The government plans in the next few weeks to put out to tender a review by
consultants. The aim is to produce a report by the end of the summer
parliamentary recess.
The findings will be used to help set the BBC's licence fee in the last
three years of its Royal Charter, which runs out at the end of 1996.
Three years ago Price Waterhouse was selected to examine the efficiency of
the BBC as part of the process of setting the existing licence fee.
The government decided then that the corporation should have one year when
the licence fee would be linked to the retail prices index minus 3 per cent.
This was followed last year and this year by a fee which rose in line with
the index.
At a reception held by the Commons media committee on Tuesday evening, Mr
Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, made it clear the lience fee
would continue to the end of the charter period.
But he emphasised that the government would be looking for evidence of
increasing BBC efficiency and it would like to keep the fee as low as
possible.
At the time of the Price Waterhouse study the government said it intended to
return to the issue to see what progress had been made.
The move will put further strains on the BBC which is trying to modernise
its operations.
