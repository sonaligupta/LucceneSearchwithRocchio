FT  23 NOV 92 / Rail sell-off proposal stirs controversy


   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent


THE GOVERNMENT'S plans for pressing ahead with the privatisation of British
Rail are being undermined by growing controversy over the implications for
jobs, train services and fares.
Yesterday the Department of Transport confirmed that delays in the
legislative timetable meant the rail privatisation bill, due to be published
this month, was unlikely to appear before the new year.
That has enabled opponents of privatisation - including many hostile forces
in BR - to build up a row similar to the one that forced a government
rethink over pit closures.
The first shot in the campaign appears to have been fired with BR's
announcement last week that 5,000 rail jobs are to go in the next four
months, with more big cuts in later years.
In breach of normal convention, it emerged, BR failed to discuss the
proposed cuts with the Transport Department before making its announcement.
Ministers are angry that the job losses were allowed to become linked with
the government's privatisation plans. Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary, is today expected to say the job losses are a commercial reaction
to BR's downturn in revenues and have nothing to do with privatisation.
Some Tory backbenchers who favour the principles of privatisation are
beginning to question whether the depth of a recession is the right time to
press ahead with it. Among the concerns are:
BR's workforce of 138,000 will suffer cuts running into tens of thousands.
Loss-making rural passenger services will be threatened with closure because
the private sector will require large subsidies to operate them.
Track charges will make Railfreight unviable.
Fares will rise as the railways are put on a more commercial footing.
