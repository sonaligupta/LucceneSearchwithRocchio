FT  26 JUN 92 / Observer: Food of love


'Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker.' The American poet Ogden Nash's idea
of a seductive diet is far out-caloried by the UK equivalent, just elicited
by a Mori poll of 1,200 citizens and published in Taste magazine.
The Brits' list of libido-livening dishes runs to dozens, with oysters
topping the ranking and chocolate and ginseng root tied for second. Several
others lower down the league, however, smack somewhat of the kinky. Besides
garlic, they include milkshakes and margarine.
