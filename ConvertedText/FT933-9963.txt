FT  06 AUG 93 / Proposals to speed road plans win broad welcome


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


GOVERNMENT measures to speed up the building of roads were yesterday
welcomed by business and the road transport industry. However, environmental
lobbyists said an accelerated roadbuilding programme would simply cause
environmental damage at a faster pace.
The measures, which were unveiled by Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, include the setting up of a Highways Agency and a review of the
500 schemes already under consideration to establish clear priorities.
Proposed changes to the planning process would also cut between three and
five years off the 13 years it currently takes to plan and build new roads.
The proposals include:
A 'less adversarial' approach to decision-taking on road schemes with
round-table conferences to seek consensus over plans.
A sweeping review of public inquiry rules to cut red tape and time-wasting
procedures.
Help to enable public inquiry inspectors produce their reports faster.
Mr MacGregor said that 'tedious time-wasting' procedures would be taken out
of the inquiry system. 'We must accelerate the delivery of vitally needed
roads and cut costs, time, bureaucracy, uncertainty and blight,' he said.
He promised that the changes would safeguard the public's right to object to
road plans.
The Confederation of British Industry said the establishment of a Highways
Agency was 'good news'.
The Royal Automobile Club saw the creation of the agency as a radical step
towards more efficient management of the road network.
Environmental groups attacked the package as an attempt to push through the
government's roads programme and called for many of the plans to be
scrapped.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England said: 'The government seems
determined to push through its discredited roads programme as quickly as
possible.'
