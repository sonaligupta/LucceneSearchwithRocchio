FT  29 JAN 92 / UK Company News: CU establishes joint venture in Poland


   By RICHARD LAPPER


Commercial Union has become the first UK insurer to invest in eastern
Europe, writes Richard Lapper.
It yesterday announced the formation of a joint venture with Wielkopolski
Bank Kredytowy of Poland.
To date German, Italian and French insurers have been more active than their
British counterparts in exploiting the opportunities emerging as a result of
economic liberalisation in eastern Europe.
CU will set up joint ventures with WBK to market life and non-life products
via the Poznan-based bank's 45 branches.
When operations begin in the autumn, the main emphasis will be on life
business. Non-life activities will be mainly confined to relatively simple
lines of household insurance.
CU's investment in the project is unlikely to exceed Pounds 10m - at least
in the initial stages - and it has no plans at present to develop activities
in other eastern European countries.
WBK, a state-owned commercial bank set up in 1989 and which will be
privatised this year, manages about 350,000 accounts.
