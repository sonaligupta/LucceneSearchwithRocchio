THE Australian government will raise ADollars 1.69bn (USDollars 1.1bn) from
the sale of a 19.9 per cent stake in Commonwealth Bank - the second tranche
of equity in the bank to be floated off by the authorities.
Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister, announced at the weekend that the
issue would be priced at ADollars 9.60 a share for institutional buyers.
Private investors are entitled to a 25 cents a share discount - meaning that
they will pay ADollars 9.35.
The sale involves a total of 178.5m shares. About 65 per cent of these have
been reserved for private investors, who submitted over 191,000
applications, representing almost ADollars 1.1bn worth of shares.
