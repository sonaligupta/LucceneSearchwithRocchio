FT  20 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Unease growing about Russia's
aluminium cuts


   By REUTER


   CANBERRA


The Russian government trade delegation attending talks between some of the
big aluminium producing countries arrived here with no new information and
without previously supplying new data, Reuter reports from Canberra.
Russian industry officials had already admitted that for 'technical reasons'
their producers had not been able to fulfil undertakings given earlier this
year and had cut annual output only by 200,000 tonnes by July 1. Russia
originally promised to cut 300,000 tonnes by the end of April and another
200,000 tonnes by August 1.
Five of the six delegations gave details of their latest production figures
before this week's meeting. One industry official, who asked not to be
identified, said Russia's failure to present more data in Canberra could be
taken as deliberate or incompetent. But this added to the feeling that
Russian producers were not playing their part in an agreement for voluntary
cuts. He said this could affect the goodwill of other participants,
especially as prices had risen sharply, increasing the temptation to boost
production.
The meetings in Canberra, which continue today and tomorrow, follow one in
Brussels in January at which trade delegates from Australia, Canada, the
European Union, Norway, Russia and the US, agreed that about 1.5m tonnes of
annual production needed to be cut for two years to bring the aluminium
market back into balance. One estimate suggests that by June producers in
the western countries had announced cuts totalling 1.28m tonnes.
Mr Vladimir Kalchenko, first deputy chairman of Russian producers' group
Aluminiy, said on Monday that Russia had no proper accounting system for
metal exports but that informal data showed imports lower in the first six
months of this year than in the second half of last year. 'We know exports
are falling, partly due to output cuts and partly to bigger domestic
demand,' he said.
Some 35 government officials from the participating states are at this
week's meeting to discuss issues covered in a 'memorandum of understanding'
signed in Ottawa in March. No industry representatives are present.
Topics on the agenda include ways to make the Russian aluminium industry
economically viable and prospects for bringing Brazil, Venezuela, Japan and
the Gulf states into the agreement.
