   ISLAMABAD


At least 1,800 people have been killed, many of them women and children, in
two weeks of bloody factional fighting in Kabul, Reuter reports from
Islamabad.
Several thousand have been injured since Hezb-I-Islami Mujahideen and forces
loyal to the Islamic coalition government joined battle two weeks ago, a
senior United Nations official said.
An estimated 126,000 of the 1.5m residents of the Afghan capital have fled,
Mr Sotirios Mousouris, personal representative of the UN secretary-general
in Afghanistan and Pakistan, said. UN agencies working in Afghanistan have
prepared an emergency package of Dollars 10m 'to address the urgent
humanitarian needs of the country arising from the current hostilities', he
added.
