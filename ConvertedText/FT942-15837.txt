FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: UK new issue activity rises 35%


   By SARA WEBB


New issue activity in the UK jumped by 35 per cent in the first quarter of
1994, with a total of Pounds 6.35bn raised by companies, according to
figures compiled by IFR Securities Data.
Initial public offerings accounted for 39 per cent of the amount raised,
with 39 floats raising Pounds 2.46bn. The IPO figures include the Pounds
413m flotation of House of Fraser, the department store group, and the
Pounds 463m public offer of shares in Beazer Homes, the UK's fourth largest
housebuilder, floated by Hanson.
'If present trends continue, 1994 will surely surpass 1993. With continued
low levels of inflation and interest rates, institutions will be looking for
the higher yields which new issues often return,' said Mr John Walter of
IFR.
Rights issues raised Pounds 2.26bn, or 36 per cent of the total volume in
the first quarter, with large issues announced by Allied-Lyons, the food and
drinks group, and by GKN, the engineering and industrial services group.
'Rights issues, which dominated the landscape in 1993, have become less
popular,' Mr Walter pointed out.
SG Warburg remained at the top of the underwriting league table with volume
of more than Pounds 1.2bn.
