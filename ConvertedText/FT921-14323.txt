FT  16 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems target taxation plan -
Economy


   By RALPH ATKINS


LIBERAL Democrats would wield the power they would have in a hung parliament
to implement policies promoting public investment but also to block Labour
tax plans for middle managers, Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday.
The Liberal Democrat leader said Labour's tax proposal would mean those with
gross earnings above Pounds 27,000 would be liable both to the 40 per cent
top rate tax and to 9 per cent national insurance contributions.
Such a 'swingeing' burden would affect the section of the workforce that
formed the 'motor' of economic growth, he said. Mr Ashdown said debate so
far in the phoney election campaign had been dominated by taxation, but the
public was more interested in investment.
He said: 'We need responsible economic management and we need to sustain
investment, particularly in education and training. Mr John Major should
make those his priority.'
In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Ashdown said the government seemed to want both
tax cuts and increased investment in public services at a time when economic
growth was zero. That could only be achieved by increased borrowing.
If any tax cuts were contemplated, they should be in VAT, Mr Ashdown added.
Under the Liberal Democrat's tax plans, National Insurance contributions
would be merged with income tax and administered by a single bureaucracy. On
incomes up to Pounds 33,000 there would be a tax rate of 34 per cent, rising
to 42 per cent for incomes up to Pounds 50,000. Over Pounds 50,000 there
would be a 50 per cent rate.
Labour also proposes a 50 per cent top rate of tax, plus nine per cent NICs,
at a so far unspecified starting point but officially described as 'well
over' Pounds 30,000.
