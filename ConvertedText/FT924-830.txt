FT  22 DEC 92 / Chambers to merge national lobbies


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


CHAMBERS of commerce and chambers of trade will end nearly a century of
rivalry when they merge on January 1 to form an organisation with 230,000
members.
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, with 80,000 members, will
absorb the National Chamber of Trade, with 150,000 members. The NCT will
form a retailing division.
The merger will create an organisation with a similar number of members to
that of the Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Ron Taylor, director-general of the association, said preliminary talks
had been held with organisations representing local enterprise agencies and
business clubs about the possibility of forming links.
One of the first actions of the combined organisation will be to launch
plans for the chambers to become 'trading formality centres' providing
information to businesses on any licences they require to start up or stay
in business.
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy, said business owners frequently do not
know what official permissions they need to operate. The centres might
forward applications to government departments to speed up registration.
The association estimated costs at about Pounds 3.65m to set up a network of
50 centres, and Pounds 2.6m a year to run them.
Mr Brown said the scheme could probably cover its costs by charging
companies between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100 for its services.
A survey of about 450 businesses had shown that 92 per cent would not object
to registering through such centres.
