FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Short-term rate cut no long-term
answer


   From Mr JEREMY HALE


Sir, Your leader 'Monetarism in retreat' was confused. If monetarism really
lives on in Paris, as you claim, French interest rates should now be much
lower. The authorities' broad money aggregate, M3, continues to grow very
slowly (0.7 per cent year on year in August) and thus to undershoot targets
(4-6.5 per cent). Predictably, nominal gross domestic product growth is also
now close to zero. Why are short-term interest rates still above 6 per cent,
or 3.5-4 per cent in real terms? Because the French authorities believe not
in monetarism but, even now, in an exchange rate target.
Further evidence of the dangers of targeting exchange rates, not of
monetarism, n'est-ce pas?
