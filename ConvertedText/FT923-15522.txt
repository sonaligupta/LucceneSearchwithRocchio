FT  01 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


STOCK INDEX futures traded in a tight range in a volatile session, while
traded options saw improved turnover, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened strongly at 2,545, the September futures contract on the FT-SE
experienced a two-way pull in which a leading independent trader was bidding
for the contract while BZW and SG Warburg were reported to be the early
sellers. The latter two gained the upper hand, which saw September go into
retreat, falling to a day's low of 2,531 and leading the underlying cash
market down.
September steadied at midsession and light buying saw it advance to the
day's high of 2,554 before once again drifting lower in the afternoon. The
firm Wall Street was said to have had no effect. For most of the session
September traded in a narrow range of 2,545 and 2,531, ending at 2,545, down
8 from the previous session and around 2 points above its estimated fair
value premium to cash of about 25. Turnover was again around 7,000 contracts
by the official close.
In traded options, turnover improved to reach 40,267 contracts. The FT-SE
option was busy, having 13,491 lots traded. BP was the most active stock
option with a day's total of 2,834 contracts. This was followed by TSB, in
which 2,036 lots were dealt.
