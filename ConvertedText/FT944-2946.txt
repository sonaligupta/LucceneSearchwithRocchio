   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Scottish Radio Holdings, formerly known as Radio Clyde, boosted annual
pre-tax profits by 39 per cent from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 4.2m and lifted
its final dividend by 50 per cent, writes David Blackwell.
The USM-traded company will be seeking a full listing in the new year. It is
also proposing a 5-for-2 share split to improve the marketability of the
shares, which closed up 2p at 570p yesterday.
Mr Ian Chapman, chairman, said the group was 'delighted to be reporting our
best ever year.' During the first two months of the new financial year,
total broadcast revenue was 24 per cent ahead.
Turnover for the year to September increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 15.7m
(Pounds 13.4m). Earnings rose from 24.7p to 31.6p.
Radio Clyde, the flagship station, has a 44 per cent share of listeners in
its area, the highest level in the UK.
The final dividend of 9p, makes 13.5p (9.5p) for the year.
