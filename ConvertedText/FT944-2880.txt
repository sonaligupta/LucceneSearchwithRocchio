FT  15 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble Dollars
200 to 6-month lows

Coffee prices tumbled for the second day in succession yesterday as roasting
companies backed away from the market and traders executed a flurry of
technically-driven selling orders. At the London Commodity Exchange, the
March futures contract closed Dollars 213 down at Dollars 2,455 a tonne, a
six-month low.
The New York market started the slide on Tuesday when futures prices lost 12
cents a pound. It failed to consolidate and recover the ground yesterday and
the market lost a further five cents to Dollars 1.48 by mid-morning.
'The market has shown no evidence we have reached a bottom yet - trading is
quite active and defensive,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, commodities analyst at
Merill Lynch in New York.
Market sentiment had weakened following a report by the US Department of
Agriculture last week, which showed that world coffee stocks were higher
than the market had thought. Prices were shaken yesterday by a report by
German statisticians estimating a rise in world output this season,
accompanied by a drop in consumption.
The FO Licht report estimated production at 92.3m bags in 1994-1995 compared
with this year's 91.1m. It put consumption at 93.4m bags in green beans
equivalent, compared with the 1993-94 level of 95.9m bags.
Mr O'Neill said the two reports had put traders on the defensive, but that a
lot of the selling was also driven by technical chart patterns. He said the
next support point on the New York market could be Dollars 1.35 to Dollars
1.40 a pound.
Guatemala will cut coffee export estimates for 1994-95 in response reports
from plantations on the southern coast that trees are producing lower yields
than expected, an official said, reports Reuters from Guatemala City.
'Farms on the coast are reporting a drop,' said Mr Max Quirin,
vice-president of Anacafe, the producers association. He blamed lack of rain
while the plants were flowering and said the drop in exports would be
between 2 and 5 per cent.
