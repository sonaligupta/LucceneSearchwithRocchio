FT  08 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Project highlights dearth of start-up
finance


   From Mr WARREN S LISTER


Sir, Your article, 'Finance sought for driverless bus network' (November 2),
highlights the problem of the 'start-up gap' faced by many entrepreneurs
involved in large projects. Companies and banks are reluctant to face the
risks inherent in providing the often quite modest front-end finance needed
to validate and establish projects to a level that encourages them to
provide backing and then construction finance.
The response, 'I'll put in money if someone else will first', is all too
familiar to those seeking start-up finance.
Central government has shown a commendable change of emphasis in looking for
ways other than building yet more roads to reduce traffic congestion and
environmental pollution, and has shown a desire to encourage the private
sector to finance large infrastructure projects.
So far, central government funds have been fed in large chunks to just a
handful of city transit schemes - and good luck to them. However, the money
needed to bridge the start-up gaps facing many transit scheme promoters is
often very modest - less than 2 per cent of a project's total cost - but the
potential rewards are great.
Central government should should spread the limited resources more widely
and provide much lower levels of funding to many more projects. It is time
the government risked a little to gain a lot.
