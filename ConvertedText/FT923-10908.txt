FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Babardian sugar at 60-year low

THE 1992 Barbadian sugar harvest has produced 54,500 tonnes, down 17 per
cent from last year but enough to satisfy its annual European Community
quota of 54,000 tonnes, according to officials in the sugar industry.
This year's output is the lowest for the industry in the past 60 years.
However, Mr David West, managing director of Barbados Sugar Industry Ltd,
the island's sole producer, said the yield was a 'remarkable achievement'
following a series of strikes and poor weather during harvesting.
The cut has left the industry unable to satisfy its 7,000-tonne US quota and
home demand of 12,000 tonnes has been covered this year by imports from
Guatemala and Trinidad.
