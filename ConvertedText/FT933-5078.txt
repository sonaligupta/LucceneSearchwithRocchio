FT  06 SEP 93 / Sihanouk may become king


   By VICTOR MALLET

PRINCE Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodian head of state, may be reinstated as king
under a constitution to be adopted next week. After a weekend of confusion,
palace officials yesterday released a faxed letter from Prince Sihanouk to
his son suggesting he might be persuaded to ascend the throne.
Prince Sihanouk yesterday also abruptly reversed a decision made only hours
earlier to sever ties with the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac).
UN officials and western diplomats are not only exasperated by his frequent
changes of direction, but concerned that the new constitution being drafted
by parliament after UN-organised elections in May will not do enough to
uphold democracy and human rights.
Before his overthrow in a coup d'etat in 1970, Prince Sihanouk was known for
his paternalism and cavalier treatment of democratic institutions. His
friendships with the leaders of North Korea and China, where he spends much
time, have not improved his international reputation.
He is now in Beijing, and has invited the Untac chief, Mr Yasushi Akashi, to
meet him there on Friday.
