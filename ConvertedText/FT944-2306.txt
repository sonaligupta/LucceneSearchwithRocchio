FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: IRI looks at bids for flat
steels producer

The board of IRI, the Italian state holding company, yesterday agreed to
examine the bids for Ilva Laminati Piani, the state-owned flat steels
producer, in the hope of reaching a deal on the sale of the company before
the end of the year.
Two consortia are understood to have submitted offers for ILP. One is an
alliance between Lucchini, the private Italian steelmaker, Usinor Sacilor of
France and Bolmat, a company formed by two Italian steel traders.
The other links Riva, another private steel producer, and Tarnofin, a group
of local entrepreneurs.
IRI did not comment on the identity of the bidders or the content of the
offers yesterday, and is set to discuss the sale again at another board
meeting before Christmas. The holding company is under pressure from the
European Commission to complete the sale of ILP before the end of the year,
in line with a deal struck by EU ministers a year ago on state aids for
Ilva. If the offers prove unsatisfactory, IRI could start private
negotiations, or invite improved bids.
Snia BPD, the quoted Italian chemicals and fibres company which is part of
the Fiat group, is to invest about Dollars 50m in the construction of a
nylon wrapping production line in the Basilicata region of southern Italy.
The new line, operated by Snia BPD's Caffaro subsidiary, will have total
capacity of 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes a year and should start production in the
middle of 1996.
The company said the investment would help strengthen its position in food
packaging, while the group is planning to invest a further Dollars 15m over
four years in research and development covering other market sectors as
well.
The industrial and R&D investments are part of a programme of development in
the region by Snia BPD, supported by the Italian state.
