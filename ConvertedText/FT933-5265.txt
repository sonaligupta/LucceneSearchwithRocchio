FT  04 SEP 93 / Australian dollar plunges amid budget wrangling

THE Australian dollar plunged to its lowest levels for six and a half years
yesterday amid vicious political wrangling over the Keating goverment's
budget proposals, announced earlier this month, and a strike by 20,000 coal
miners.
Overseas investors and speculators drove the currency down to USDollars
0.6550 in overnight trading on Thursday, and the Australian dollar then
closed in Sydney at USDollars 0.6528 yesterday - the lowest level seen since
1987.
The dollar's fall came despite intervention by the Reserve Bank of
Australia, which started around the Dollars 0.6635 mark and continued down
to Dollars 0.6560. The fall was attributed partly to a slide in the bullion
price and generally weaker commodity prices.
However, uncertainty over of the final shape of the government's budget
strategy and the failure of the coalminers to return to workalso contributed
to the nervousness surrounding the currency.
The budget plan has stalled in the face of opposition in the Australian
senate, where it needs support from the minority Democrat and Green Party
senators to pass. Earlier this week, the government announced modifications
including an increased tax rebate for low income earners and a reduced
differential between leaded and unleaded petrol - which won qualified
support from the Democrats.
Meanwhile, coal miners in New South Wales and Queensland, who began a
five-day strike on Wednesday night to protest against price-cutting by
exporting companies, continued their industrial action yesterday despite
calls from the Coal Industry Tribunal to return to work.
