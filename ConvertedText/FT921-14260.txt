FT  16 JAN 92 / Appointments: Challenge for Dobson at Do It All


Steve Russell is to be the new managing director of Do It All, the
do-it-yourself company jointly owned by Boots and WH Smith.
Peter Dobson, who joined Do It All as managing director when the company was
formed in June 1990, is retiring at the age of 56 and will be succeeded by
Russell, who is currently director of merchandise at Boots the Chemist.
Dobson was not available to comment yesterday, but WH Smith says he is
retiring because he has completed his task - that of integrating the Boots
and WH Smith DIY businesses. 'He's at an age when people are beginning to
think about early retirement,' says WH Smith.
Dobson was managing director of Payless, Boots's DIY division, before it was
merged with Smith's DIY business. Although the joint venture's non-executive
chairman was to be appointed in turn from each of the parent companies,
Russell's appointment is based entirely on his qualifications, WH Smith
says.
Russell will have a formidable task in turning round Do It All; turnover
fell by 13 per cent in the six months to December 1, and the company is
having to define and establish its new concept store in a difficult UK
trading climate.
