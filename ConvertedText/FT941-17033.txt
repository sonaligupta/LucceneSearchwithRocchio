FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: MCA joins consortium for Osaka
theme park

   NEW YORK, LONDON


MCA, the Japanese-owned US entertainment group, announced yesterday it was
joining a consortium to develop a theme park in the Japanese city of Osaka,
which would be modelled on its Universal Studios park in Florida.
Universal Studios Japan will cost more than Dollars 1bn to build.
Construction will begin in 1996 and the park is scheduled to open in the
spring of 1999.
Other members of the consortium include the city of Osaka and companies
based in the city, including Matsushita Electric Industrial, MCA's parent.
MCA said yesterday the Rank Organisation, which is its joint venture partner
in Universal Studios in Florida, might also be involved. In London, Rank
said it had the right to take part but no obligation, and was considering
its options.
The park development is a by-product of Matsushita's Dollars 6bn takeover in
1990 of MCA, which owns Hollywood's Universal film studios as well as theme
parks in California and Florida based on its movies. It is the first major
project by the two companies in Japan.
Mr Frank Stanek, head of MCA Enterprises International, said equity
participants would include both MCA and Matsushita but it was too early to
give a breakdown of investors' stakes.
The park will be built on a waterfront site owned by industrial companies
involved in the consortium, and might be followed by the development of
adjacent properties as a complete urban resort.
The success of Tokyo Disneyland, which attracts some 16m visitors a year,
suggests there is a strong Japanese taste for theme parks.
MCA believes that an Osaka site, some three hours by train from Tokyo, will
tap a different market from Disneyland. It also hopes to attract South-east
Asian visitors, helped by Osako's new airport opening later this year.
