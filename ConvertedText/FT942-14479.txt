FT  20 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Property valuation


Any professional body which examines its working practices and recommends
that its members should work harder to produce vaguer conclusions should be
treated with suspicion. For that reason, it would easy to dismiss the Royal
Institution of Charterered Surveyors' review as a charter for fatter fees
and greater obfuscation. It certainly seems odd that the authors felt it
necessary to make 43 densely argued recommendations if their chief aim was
to encourage greater credibility, reliability and clarity.
The need for surveyors to justify their valuation techniques was plain to
see following the Queens Moat Houses fiasco. To its credit, RICS has faced
up to that challenge and consulted widely with its clients and other related
professions. The recommendations encouraging the wider dissemination of data
and the principle of greater disclosure are particularly welcome. It would
be a fine thing indeed if surveyors could provide fuller and more regular
explanations of their valuations in company accounts.
RICS is also candid enough to admit that the supreme objective of valuation
 -accuracy - may always elude the surveyor's grasp. Yet that does not
matter. After all, if everyone agreed about a property's precise value there
would be no market. It is the very imperfections in valuations which produce
both buyers and sellers. The task of the valuer must be to produce
comprehensive and objective data about which investors can honourably
disagree.
