FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New man at the top for Babcock


The new chief executive of Babcock International, the engineering group, is
to be Mr John Parker, who resigned this week as chairman and chief executive
of Harland & Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder.
He will take the job vacated by Mr Oliver Whitehead, who left Babcock in
April after disagreeing with the board over strategy.
Babcock declined to confirm the appointment yesterday but is expected to
make an announcement soon which will involve further management changes.
