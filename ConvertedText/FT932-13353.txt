FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Management team to take over French radio
network


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


A CONSORTIUM led by management and including Hambros Bank is set to take
over FRM, the French radio network whose losses brought down Crown
Communications, the UK broadcasting group.
Crown went into receivership in January with debts of Pounds 16m.
Its main asset, London Broadcasting Company, floated clear and effective
control passed to Chelverton Investments, whose main shareholders are Mr
Matthew Cartisser and Mr John Porter.
The CSA, the French regulatory authority, has chosen the management team led
by Mr Andrew Manderstam, who has been running the network since Crown took
control in 1989, as the most appropriate owners.
Two other bids were rejected: one from Mr Albert Cohen's Nostalgie and the
other from NRJ, the radio network which has been trying to buy FRM from some
time.
The decision by the CSA to block a sale by Crown to NRJ triggerred the
receivership of the British company that once was the darling of the
Unlisted Securities Market.
The Manderstam-led consortium, backed by Hambros European Ventures, is
expected to make an offer for Crown's stake in FRM.
Arthur Andersen, Crown's receivers, will try to get as much as possible for
the stake.
The radio network links 114 stations and goes under the slogan: 'Tous les
tops, toute la Pop, sans les flops' (all the tops, all the hits and none of
the flops.)
Throughout the drama FRM has remained on the air.
