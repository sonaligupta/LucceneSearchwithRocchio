FT  23 APR 93 / The Lex Column: European car market


It hardly needed Mercedes-Benz and Peugeot to tell us that life is hard in
the European car business. One of the most marked characteristics of the
current downturn has been the way in which manufacturers have consistently
underestimated the size of the problem. The market may be heading for a 15
per cent fall this year, while carmakers cling to thoughts of a 10 per cent
decline. That is particularly unfortunate given existing overcapacity and
the Japanese transplants and eastern European production which will soon be
on stream. Volkswagen and Mercedes say they are getting a grip on the threat
posed by their high costs. But it is unlikely that they can slim fast enough
to avoid horrifying operating losses for some time.
The current downturn is also unusual because, with the exception of the UK,
all of the EC's major markets are in decline simultaneously. Perhaps
carmakers are the first victims of the single market and ERM convergence?
Certainly European manufacturers are unused to the kind of volatility in
demand which is commonplace in the US.
A widespread downturn also highlights the regional constraints of the
European industry. The strength of Far Eastern markets and recovery in the
US are only of marginal benefit to European companies. With the possible
exception of Volkswagen, the EC lacks competitors with the global reach of
Ford, GM and Toyota.
