FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Scepticism grows over Australian
brewing deal


   By KEVIN BROWN


   SYDNEY


SA Brewing shares rose 9 cents to ADollars 3.10 on the Australian Stock
Exchange yesterday, reflecting growing scepticism about the group's proposed
merger with Foster's Brewing Group. Foster's shares fell 7 cents to ADollars
1.92.
The share movements suggest investors believe the proposed merger would
benefit International Brewing Holdings (IBH), Foster's main shareholder, at
the expense of SA Brewing shareholders.
Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's, the US credit rating agency, placed both
companies on creditwatch for a possible downgrading, further complicating
the proposal.
'In our view, the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the merger proposal
and its effects on lenders to Foster's is sufficient to place Foster's on
creditwatch with developing implications,' the ratings agency said.
It said the merger would affect SA Brewing's credit rating by exposing the
group to a higher degree of leverage, and reducing the strength of its
conservatively-geared balance sheet.
Foster's long-term unsecured debt is rated BB, and its commercial paper B1.
The longer-term unsecured debt of SA Brewing is rated BBB plus, and its
commercial paper A2.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, is in the middle of a roadshow
for institutional investors in Melbourne and Sydney, in an attempt to
generate enthusiasm for the merger proposal.
However, brokers said that the deal was unlikely to succeed because of the
opposition of Foster's' directors, lack of enthusiasm from Asahi Breweries
of Japan, which owns 20 per cent of Foster's, and also regulatory
difficulties.
SA Brewing was believed to be having trouble persuading institutional
investors to support the sale of about 6 per cent of IBH's entitlement to
shares in the merged group at a price valuing its Foster's shares at
ADollars 2.50.
