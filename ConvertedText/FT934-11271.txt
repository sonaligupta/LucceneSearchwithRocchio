FT  02 NOV 93 / US court rejects Names' appeal


   A GROUP of US Names


the individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's insurance market -
yesterday failed in their attempts to have a case against the insurance
market's authorities heard in the US.
The US Supreme Court yesterday refused to hear an appeal by a group of more
than 100 Names who alleged that Lloyd's had breached US securities laws.
The group of US names had claimed that the market's authorities, along with
some syndicates and brokers, had breached US securities law by failing to
disclose liabilities on pollution and catastrophe-related policies.
The court said agreements signed by the Names required them to pursue their
case in the UK.
