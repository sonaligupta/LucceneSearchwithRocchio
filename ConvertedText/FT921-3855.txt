FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Agency lifts credit watch

   HONG KONG


MOODY'S Investors Services, the US credit agency, has taken the Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank off its 'credit watch' list and confirmed its Prime-1 rating
for short-term deposits and commercial paper, writes Simon Holberton in Hong
Kong.
Mr John Gray, the bank's deputy chairman, said: 'We're happy about' the
reinstatement. He said the bank had found it difficult to understand why it
had been placed on credit watch.
Moody's said the confirmation rested on a balance of positive and negative
factors. Although a number of Hongkong Bank's affiliates remained
problematic 'their performance appears to have . . . begun to turn around,'
the agency added.
The confirmation of ratings covers the bank's Canadian and US subsidiaries
and Concord Leasing. In aggregate, the bank's short-term debt is valued at
about USDollars 1.5bn. It has no long-term debt.
