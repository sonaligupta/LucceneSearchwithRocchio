FT  26 MAY 93 / Polish coalition feels pressure over budget


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI

POLAND'S six-party coalition government faced mounting pressure yesterday
after Ms Hanna Suchocka, the prime minister, said that she was not prepared
to amend this year's budget.
The former Communist SLD group has demanded budget changes, in the form of
public sector pay increases, in exchange for its 60 votes which could save
the government in a no-confidence motion on Friday. The motion is being put
forward by the disgruntled Solidarity union group.
The government, however, is bound to its budget targets, which include a
deficit fixed at 5 per cent of GDP in exchange for a Dollars 660m (Pounds
428.5m) stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund. The collapse of
this agreement could lead to the cancellation by western governments of
promised cuts in Poland's debt next year.
The government can count on the support of only around 183 deputies in the
460-strong chamber, where a disunited opposition controls 258 seats. The
SLD, which has already voted with the government on its privatisation plans,
now needs the concessions on the budget to explain to its increasingly
confused supporters why it wants to keep the present cabinet in power.
