FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi Materials pre-tax
profit slides 66% in first half

MITSUBISHI Materials, the Japanese copper, cement and industrial materials
supplier, yesterday blamed the appreciation of the yen and weak demand from
manufacturers for a 66.5 per cent fall, to Y2.02bn (Dollars 18.6m), in
first-half pre-tax profit.
Sales for the period from April until September fell 9.1 per cent to
Y342.8bn. The company said demand has been particularly sluggish from the
construction, car, and electronics industries.
It said the recent fall in Japanese interest rates should stimulate the
economy, but the continued strength of the yen was likely to hinder growth.
For the full year, pre-tax profit is forecast at Y4bn, compared with Y9.8bn
last year, on sales of Y700bn, down from Y743bn.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, a copper and gold producer, reported an 89.1 per cent
plunge to Y692m in pre-tax profit, on a 15.8 per cent slide in sales to
Y192.3bn.
The company had an operating loss of Y4.9bn, compared with a profit of Y2bn
last year. It said sales of securities holdings enabled it to report a
pre-tax profit.
Many Japanese companies are using sales of securities to bolster profits
this year, raising questions about the future of some long-term
cross-shareholdings.
Company officials indicated that an increase in capital spending in the past
two years had pushed up depreciation charges this year.
This added to the difficulties caused by the yen's strength and the
continuing decline in demand from industrial Japan.
For the full year, Sumitomo has forecast a pre-tax profit of Y1.5bn, a sharp
fall from last year's Y8.5bn, on sales of Y370bn, down from Y444bn. Capital
spending this year is expected to be Y12.2bn, compared with Y25.8bn last
year.
