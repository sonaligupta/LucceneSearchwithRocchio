   By DAVID GOODHART


THERE were 35 industrial disputes in progress last November, the lowest
November total since 1933, according to provisional estimates from the
Department of Employment, David Goodhart writes.
It is provisionally estimated that 45,000 working days were lost in
Nov-ember last year, compared with 83,000 in October, and an average of
533,000 for November during the 1980s.
During the 12 months to November last year it is provisionally estimated
that a total of 800,000 working days was lost as a result of 371 industrial
disputes. The comparable figures for 1990 were 2.2m working days lost and
629 stoppages in progress.
