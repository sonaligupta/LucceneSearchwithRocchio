FT  16 MAR 94 / Journalists strike in pensions protest


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


Italian journalists yesterday began a four-day strike in protest over plans
by the Ciampi government to place some of the surplus in the journalists'
pension fund in the main state-operated pensions scheme.
The strike provoked dismay among political parties who have been relying on
the media for coverage in the final 11 days of the general election
campaign.
The stoppage will affect all newspapers today and Thursday, and television
and radio on the following two days.
The stoppage is the result of a long-running battle between the journalists
union and the government over the pension fund. As part of an effort to
boost the fast depleting coffers of the state-operated pension scheme, the
Ciampi governmment decided last year to raid the surpluses of separately
operated, but state-run entities, controlling the pensions of the various
professions.
The strike comes as Italian journalists have for the first time come under
investigation for corruption. Three prominent economic writers are being
investigated by Milan magistrates for allegedly receiving money from the
Ferruzzi-Montedison group.
The investigations follow revelations by Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing
director of Ferruzzi-Montedison who has admitted large-scale illicit funding
of poltiical parties.
Mr Sama said he had submitted to Milan magistrates the names of several
journalists who had been paid sums of money to help improve
Ferruzzi-Montedison's image.
The journalists deny the allegations. They are Mr Giuseppe Turani, of La
Repubblica, Mr Osvaldo De Paolini, former City editor of the business daily
Sole-24 Ore, and Mr Ugo Bertone of La Stampa.
Italian journalism has claimed much credit for exposing the corrupt links
between business and politics.
