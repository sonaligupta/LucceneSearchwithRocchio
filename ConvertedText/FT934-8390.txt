FT  16 NOV 93 / People: Texas Homecare selects its new finance director


John Coleman, new chief executive of Ladbroke's DIY chain Texas Homecare,
has brought in another colleague from his days at the Dorothy Perkins chain,
David Adams, to join his team as finance director.
Coleman, formerly chief executive of Dorothy Perkins, announced earlier this
month that he had recruited Stephen Hibbert, operations director at the
Burton group's fashion chain, to be his operations director at Texas.
Adams, 39, has worked with Coleman for five years, first as finance director
of the Top Man and Top Shop chains, and later as FD at Dorothy Perkins.
After gaining an economics degree from Edinburgh University, Adams began his
career at British Leyland as a graduate trainee, but moved a year later to
spend three years at ITT.
From 1981 to 1985 he held various financial planning and analytical roles at
Max Factor, the cosmetics group, before becoming an accountant with National
Adhesives, a division of Unilever. He joined Burton group's corporate
finance department in 1986.
Adams fills a post that has been vacant since June when Peter Hallett left
Texas to join Hobson, the toiletries group.
John Coleman, who joined Texas in September, has quickly assembled his team.
Earlier this month he appointed Nigel Franks as property director and moved
Andrew Kinnell, formerly operations director, to the new post of director of
systems and logistics.
