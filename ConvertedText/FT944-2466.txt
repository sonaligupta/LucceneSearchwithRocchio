FT  16 DEC 94 / Life insurer to pay record penalty


   By ALISON SMITH


The UK life insurance subsidiary of Irish Life will have to pay a record
amount in fines and costs totalling Pounds 385,000 for widespread failures
in training, recruitment and monitoring of staff.
The Pounds 300,000 fine equals the record penalty imposed by Lautro, the
self-regulating body for life insurers which has been superseded by the
Personal Investment Authority. Norwich Union and Premium Life were fined the
same amount in April.
Lautro also told Irish Life Assurance to pay its costs of Pounds 85,000. The
company has paid more than Pounds 135,000 compensation to 86 investors.
The first set of charges relates to inadequate monitoring and compliance of
the sales force and 'tied' agents authorised to sell ILA products only from
March 1991 to the end of last year. The second charge relates to failures
involving the company's training and competence scheme.
The regulator said that although it had approved the scheme early in 1992,
assessment visits to the company in spring this year revealed that it had
not been fully put into practice.
Irish Life says it is committed to the UK market. Last month, a
re-organisation of the group brought the Irish and UK retail businesses into
a single unit instead of the UK business being run as part of its European
operations.
Mr David Kingston, managing director, said the move would 'underpin our
strategic repositioning in the UK market'.
The UK life sector as a whole is facing increasing costs in order to meet
rising regulatory standards.
At the same time, levels of new business have been hit by public concern
about standards of selling in the industry.
For the six months to the end of June, Irish Life's total new business in
the UK fell by 37 per cent to IPounds 13.2m (Pounds 13m).
