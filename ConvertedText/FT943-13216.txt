FT  21 JUL 94 / Observer: Hanley gets a handful


Will new Tory party chairman Jeremy Hanley again display his Dennis the
Menace cufflinks? The nastily naughty Dennis is one of the UK's most
well-established comic characters. Hanley's links caused a stir at the
Northern Ireland political talks during his stint as a junior Northern
Ireland minister. Children's entertainment seems to have been a recurrent
theme of those tense negotiations.
During them, Hanley was said to have been accused of introducing 'Blue Peter
documents'. The term derives from another ageless feature of British
childhood, the BBC television programme Blue Peter, whose presenters
instruct children how to fashion wonderful objects from old detergent
bottles and glue, using the catch-phrase 'here's one I made earlier'.
Hanley's accountancy training will be useful for a party with a Pounds 17m
debt. But has he enough spare time? What with constituency work, Mensa
membership, his cookery, chess, cricket, languages, theatre, cinema, music
and golf interests, surely something has to give.
