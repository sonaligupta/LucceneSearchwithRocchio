FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buckingham Pounds 104m loss after property
write-down


   By SIMON DAVIES


Buckingham International, the hotels and property group, yesterday reported
a pre-tax loss of Pounds 104m in the year to October 31, as a result of
massive write-downs on the value of its properties.
The result, on turnover of Pounds 55.4m (Pounds 58.5m), compared with a
Pounds 258,000 pre-tax profit last time.
The company completed a support plan in February, in the face of net
borrowings of Pounds 92.9m, and a fall in shareholders' funds from Pounds
112.6m to Pounds 3.15m. This represents gearing of almost 3,000 per cent.
Mr John Clark, chief executive, said yesterday that the support plan was
intact, in spite of the latest results.
However, Buckingham's bankers and Pounds 33m stock holders are still
insisting that debts remain payable upon demand, in order to continue to put
pressure on management to pursue its disposal programme.
The group's problems centre on rising debt and falling hotel values in the
US and Portugal.
Of the Pounds 103m exceptional charge, Pounds 95.7m was related to property
write-downs, of which more than 60 per cent was on Portuguese investments.
Buckingham has only tentative support from its creditors. Its survival
relies on the Inland Revenue allowing the postponement of Pounds 2.7m of tax
payments, and on the failure of an ongoing Pounds 12m legal claim against
the company.
Mr Clark admits that all this 'is necessarily uncertain'. The support plan
runs until October, when Buckingham hopes to refinance its debt.
Buckingham sold the Holiday Inn, Lisbon, and its nursing home division, for
a total of Pounds 16m. This was a significant component of the support plan.
The shares fell by 1 1/2 p to 4p yesterday, which compares with its 1991
high of 51 1/2 p.
