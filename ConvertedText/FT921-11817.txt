   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


COCA-COLA yesterday announced a IPounds 27m expansion plan for its drinks
concentrate manufacturing plant at Drogheda in Ireland, which is operated by
a subsidiary, Coca-Cola Atlantic.
Construction work is to begin immediately, and the plant is expected to be
operational by the end of the year.
The Drogheda facility is already Coca-Cola's largest concentrate
manufacturing plant in Europe, and supplies bottling plants in 70 different
countries.
Mr Ray McReave, the general manager of Coca-Cola Atlantic, said: 'Much of
the Coca-Cola company's success in expanding to meet the needs of growing
markets in Europe is as a result of the high standards achieved in the
Drogheda operation'.
A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Atlantic said the expansion was a 'significant
one', but would not give details of expected increase in turnover 'for
competitive reasons'. She said, however, that Coca-Cola's market has been
expanding at 9 per cent a year over the past five years, and the company's
main market opportunities 'are in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and parts
of Asia'.
