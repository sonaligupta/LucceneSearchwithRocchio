   By ROBERT GIBBENS


   MONTREAL


ABITIBI-Price cut its losses sharply in the second quarter, helped by firmer
newsprint prices, a lower Canadian dollar and reduced operating costs.
Newsprint sales rose 17 per cent but uncoated groundwood papers were weak.
Net loss was CDollars 18.2m (USDollars 14.2m), or 27 cents a share, against
a loss of CDollars 37.5m, or 55 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 19 per
cent to CDollars 493m.
The first-half loss was CDollars 47m, or 69 cents, against a deficit of
CDollars 75.4m or CDollars 1.11 a year ago, on sales of CDollars 964m, up 21
per cent.
