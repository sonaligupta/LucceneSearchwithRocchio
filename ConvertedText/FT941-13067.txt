FT  27 JAN 94 / People: Inchcape to gain as much as it will lose


Inchcape, the international marketing and services group, is losing one
well-connected non-executive director and picking up another. Jurgen Hintz,
51, chief executive of CarnaudMetalbox, the Anglo-French packaging group, is
replacing Jean-Paul Parayre, 56, a supervisory board member of Peugeot, who
is retiring from the Inchcape board in May in order to devote more time to
his increasing business commitments in France.
Inchcape has always prided itself on its international connections; Hintz
seems to fit the bill nicely. A US citizen born in Germany, he has worked
and lived in the UK, Germany, and France as well as the US where he was an
executive vice president of Procter & Gamble.
