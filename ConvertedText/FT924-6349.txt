FT  21 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Retailers busy on bid hopes


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN


ACQUISITION rumours swirled around retailer Kingfisher yesterday, sending
the shares into reverse as investors worried about the potentially diluting
effects of any funding requirements. Early talk centred on Kwik Fit, sending
shares in the automotive parts group racing forward and forcing its board to
issue a statement saying it knew of no reason for the price movement. The
shares had jumped 10.5p on Thursday and a further 8.5p yesterday to close at
97p.
Analysts were mostly sceptical about the Kwik Fit speculation, arguing that
Kingfisher's earlier attempts to break into the automotive parts market had
not been a great success. Also the company had privately said on a number of
occasions it would not bid for Kwik Fit, one of the market's bid favourites.
However, the rise in Kwik Fit's shares was offset by a stronger rumour that
Kingfisher was considering buying a 32 per cent stake in the leading French
DIY group, Castorama. Carrefour, which owns the shares, was said to have
confirmed to analysts yesterday that its holding was up for sale. Castorama,
which is capitalised at around Pounds 700m, turned over FFr5.7bn in the
first half of this year making pre-tax profits of FFr88.9m. It holds 13 per
cent of the French DIY market. A potential buyer would have to pay in the
region of Pounds 250m if it were to buy the Carrefour stake.
A full bid for Castorama is thought unlikely. One fifth of the shares are
family-controlled and a further 5 per cent owned by employees. Kingfisher,
which owns the UK's leading DIY group, B&Q, is known to want to expand its
European operations. However, the takeover talk unsettled investors with
worries over the cost of particularly the Kwik Fit venture, and Kingfisher
shares fell 8 to 553p.
Rolls-Royce weak
A substantial downgrading of its profit forecast for Rolls-Royce by the
company's own brokerage house drove stock in the aerospace engineering group
to a post-privatisation low. The new estimates from broker Hoare Govett are
believed to be at the lower end of the market's range and the shares fell 9
before closing a net 4 1/2 lower at 96 1/2 p. Turnover of 16m shares was
among the heaviest in the London market and Rolls was also the most actively
traded stock option in the derivatives market.
Hoare has cut its forecast for the current year by Pounds 20m to Pounds 50m
and for 1993 by Pounds 35m to Pounds 80m. It has also raised questions about
the fate of the dividend. The house believes that R&D costs will remain high
while the outlook for spares sales, civil engine orders military orders and
overall turnover in the aerospace industry continues to prompt concern. BZW
was said to have cut its dividend forecast to 5.1p per share from 7.25p.
Fisons trimmed
Pharmaceutical group Fisons dropped 10 to 200p on turnover of 8.8m shares
with a forecast review from Japanese securities house Nomura contributing to
weakness in the stock. A new pharmaceuticals team at Nomura has decided that
estimates for Fisons were lagging the market view. While unwilling to
comment yesterday, the team is believed to have reduced its 1992 profit
forecast of Pounds 130m to Pounds 100m, around the bottom of the range.
There was also talk that Goldman Sachs had been a seller but the US house
said it had not changed its recommendation or its forecast.
The Gatt agreement reversed an early decline in the shares of drinks stocks
with international exposure. Allied Lyons, closed 14 ahead at 655p, Grand
Metropolitan added 6 to 414p, and Guinness jumped 7 to 544p.
In-depth research of the UK newspaper industry by integrated securities
house SG Warburg benefited United Newspapers. The shares lifted 7 to 466p as
Warburg reinforced its buy stance on the stock as part of a sector review
discussed with clients yesterday. The house also liked Daily Telegraph,
which added 4 at 317p.
Various rumours of increased competition gave some dealers the chance to
offload an overhang of Carlton Communications and sell the shares down 16 to
709p. Full-year profits on December 8 are expected to be impressive but some
analysts were arguing that after Wellcome and Glaxo Carlton had the highest
price/earnings ratio in the FT-SE 100 index and the rating was not
justified. Meanwhile Wellcome lifted 18 to 1024p and Glaxo rose 12 to 825p,
both on a stronger US dollar.
Retailer Dixons fell back 5 to 231p after UBS Phillips & Drew issued a sell
recommendation, highlighting worries over the effects of devaluation of
sterling on the company's costs.
Albert Fisher was the biggest traded stock in the market, turning over 17m
shares, the shares rising 4 to 57p. SG Warburg was again said to be pushing
the stock.
British Gas shrugged off the debilitating effects of higher than expected
third-quarter numbers announced on Thursday and raced higher in the wake of
determined buying said to have emanated from Continental institutions.
At the close Gas shares were 7 higher at 286 1/2 p. Energy specialists said
the shares were viewed by European investors as offering an exceptionally
attractive prospective yield.
BP edged up 2 1/2 to 232p on 4.2m traded and Shell 7 to 545p on 2.6m, helped
by an upturn in crude oil prices. Enterprise Oil jumped 9 to 449p, also
stimulated by hints of strong European buying.
Aitken Hume, the banking and investment management group, surprised the
market by announcing it was involved in talks that could lead to a bid for
the company. Aitken shares rocketed 14 to 49p on the news.
An agency cross of 4.7m shares at 245p a share had little impact on London &
Manchester which eased 2 to 248p.
Hints that about 2m shares were on offer early in the day upset Blue Circle
Industries. The shares dipped to 171p but later picked up to close only 3
easier at 174p with dealers convinced that a bid for the group may well
appear.
Simon Engineering jumped 20 to 99p amid speculation of a possible bid or
that the group has found a buyer for one of its businesses. However, some
analysts said the stock was higher because it had been oversold.
The price of Caird Group halved after the environmental services company
warned of lower results in the second half. Caird added that it was unlikely
to pay a final dividend, after a first half 1.33p per share payout. The
shares slumped 16 to 17p.
The Caird profits warning unsettled water stocks with waste disposal
interests. Among these Severn Trent, which owns the Biffa waste disposal
business, ran back 4 to 472p. Yorkshire Water eased 2 to 529p and Wessex
eased to 589p.
Container leasing group Tiphook rebounded 19 to 239p after US investment
bank Lehman Brothers raised its rating on the company to a buy from
outperform.
