FT  28 JUL 92 / Romania's leading party faces polls fight


   By VIRGINIA MARSH

ROMANIA'S politicians face a long, hot summer with the start yesterday of a
two-month campaign for concurrent presidential and parliamentary elections
on September 27.
The polls, only the second general elections since the overthrow of the
Ceausescu regime in December 1989, are expected to lead to significant
changes in the country's political spectrum.
With no strong opponent nominated to challenge Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's
president, he appears virtually assured of a second term of office, this
time for four years.
However, in parliament, the National Salvation Front (NSF) which swept to
power in May, 1990, with two-thirds of the vote, looks certain to lose its
dominance.
The NSF was weakened earlier this year by internal disputes between those
favouring the reformist Mr Petre Roman, the former prime minister, and the
supporters of the more conservative Mr Iliescu, a former high-ranking
communist official, who left to form the Democratic National Salvation Front
(DNSF).
The NSF has also seen its power eroded by the Democratic Convention (DC), a
coalition of opposition parties which successfully contested February's
local elections, winning control of many key cities including Bucharest, the
capital, and the Transylvanian town of Timisoara, birthplace of the 1989
revolution.
However, the DC has been rocked by internal quarrels, too, notably over its
choice of presidential candidates and by the departure of the National
Liberal Party, one of Romania's parties from the 1920s.
Pollsters disagree which of the three main groupings, the DNSF, the NSF and
the DC, will be the victor. Most believe the future government will be a
coalition between Mr Roman's NSF and the DC. Some fear that DNSF and other
left-wing parties will emerge strong enough to take power through alliances
with extreme right nationalist parties.
