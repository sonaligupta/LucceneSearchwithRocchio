The campaign of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left-winger trailing in
Brazil's presidential election race, received a lift yesterday when an
opinion poll suggested his support has grown 3 percentage points in the last
week. However, opinion polls still suggest the front runner and former
finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso has enough of a lead to win in
the first round next Monday.
