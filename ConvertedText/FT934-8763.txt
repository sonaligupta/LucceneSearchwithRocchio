FT  13 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Bargain hunting brings
Nikkei recovery

   TOKYO


BARGAIN-hunting and buying of Nikkei 300 stocks boosted share prices, and
the Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.8 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 closed up 335.03 at 18,493.55, down 0.5 per cent on the week. It
fell to a low of 18,104.21 soon after the opening, and rose to a high of
18,592.26 in the afternoon.
Volume totalled 442.9m shares against 310m. Gainers overwhelmed losers by
947 to 113 with 105 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
surged 31.49, or 2.1 per cent to 1,566.07 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 3.25 to 1,259.59.
The ministry of finance announced that it would allow investment trusts to
set up funds linked to the Nikkei 300 index, prompting buying of component
shares of the index.
Brokers were seen buying on their own accounts, together with some life
insurance companies. Investors were also encouraged by the absence of
selling pressure from yesterday's settlement of the November options
contract.
Foreigners were seen buying large-capital shares, including leading steel
companies. Nippon Steel gained Y12 to Y336.
Bank stocks were strong on index-linked buying and bargain hunting.
Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y90 to Y3,230 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced
Y60 to Y2,960.
Chichibu Cement, which is to be absorbed by Onoda Cement, fell Y150 to
Y1,050. Daishowa Paper, whose chairman was arrested, allegedly for bribing
politicians, found no buyers and closed at an offered price of Y1,330.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 370.08 to 20,606.36 in volume of 20.9m
shares. Aoyama Trading, a retailer of low-priced men's suits, gained Y140 to
Y8,270 after reporting a surge in interim sales and earnings.

1,380.84 after an intraday high of 1,399.59, up 7 per cent this week.
