FT  05 MAR 94 / Post chief stresses rewards of sell-off for staff


   By ROLAND RUDD


Mr Bill Cockburn, Post Office chief executive, has promised his workforce
shares and dividends if the government privatises the corporation.
Writing in Courier, the staff newspaper sent yesterday to all 180,000
employees, Mr Cockburn said the sale of the Post Office would give it the
freedom to compete internationally.
'It would allow us to give shares and dividends to all employees, thus
sharing the rewards of success,' he writes. 'Make no mistake, that would be
a lot better than staying in the public sector without the freedom we need.'
Mr Cockburn's message to staff marks the first time he has come out publicly
in favour of privatisation. He believes the alternative of remaining in the
public sector without commercial freedom in its business activities is the
worst possible option. His comments follow a Treasury decision to continue
to refuse the Post Office the commercial freedom it is seeking to compete
with private-sector mail and parcel carriers.
Mr Peter Hain, the Labour MP sponsored by the Union of Communication Workers
 -which represents Post Office employees - said: 'There appears to be a
pincer movement between the Post Office management and Michael Heseltine to
soften up the workforce and the public for privatisation.
'They know that privatisation is bitterly opposed by the workforce. This is
an all too transparent attempt to bribe them; I don't think it will work.'
Mr Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, recently told the trade and
industry committee he favoured privatisation of the Royal Mail, but had been
prevented from changing its ownership because of 'political considerations'.
Since the government first announced its review of the Post Office's future
in 1992, the management, advised by the UK merchant bank Schroders, has been
working on its favoured option of a management buy-out.
