FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Minimum wage


MR NEIL KINNOCK said yesterday that Labour's national minimum wage will stay
fixed at Pounds 3.40 an hour, in spite of the rise in median earnings due
next month. Under Labour's original proposals the minimum was to be fixed at
half the median earnings rate, expected to be about Pounds 7.20 an hour in
April.
