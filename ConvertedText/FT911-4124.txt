FT  20 APR 91 / Tory attacks new tax


THE GOVERNMENT'S successor to the community charge was branded a 'Sloane
Rangers Aid Bill' by a Tory MP last night. Mr Derek Conway, MP for
Shrewsbury, said: 'Under the Cabinet's latest proposal, a two-bedroomed flat
in Sloane Square, London. . . will be classed as the same as a two-bedroomed
flat in a terrace in the Midlands or North.'
