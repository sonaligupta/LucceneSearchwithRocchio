FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of Eastern France (6): Parachutist on the right -
Profile of the mayor of Epinal


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


MR PHILIPPE SEGUIN is better known as a leading rebel member of the
conservative RPR party than as mayor of Epinal, a job he has held for the
past nine years, writes William Dawkins.
Now aged 49, Mr Seguin achieved national distinction two months ago when he
emerged as leader of the campaign against the Maastricht treaty on European
monetary and political union.
His arguments that the treaty was an affront to national sovereignty
reflected the mood of his own electorate in Epinal and Les Vosges (where Mr
Seguin is also MP), which showed up as islands of anti-Maastricht sentiment
in the otherwise pro-treaty region of Lorraine.
His Maastricht campaign reinforced Mr Seguin's claim as a possible successor
to Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, despite a lacklustre performance in a
television debate with President Francois Mitterrand.
Unlike his counterpart in Strasbourg, Mr Seguin was not born and brought up
in the town where he is mayor - a common phenomenon whereby French political
parties 'parachute' promising supporters into local government jobs.
Mr Seguin, born and educated in Tunisia before its independence from France,
is a graduate of the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the training ground
for many in the French political and business elite, and was a junior
minister in the 1986-1988 Gaullist government. He looks likely to become an
influential member of the French cabinet if, as seems likely, the right wins
next March's legislative elections.
Far from neglecting Epinal in pursuit of his national ambitions, Mr Seguin
has cultivated his local base, working hard to lobby foreign companies to
come to Les Vosges and overseeing an unprecedented increase in investment in
leisure and cultural facilities by local government in Epinal.
He complains, however, that the economic development of Les Vosges is
handicapped by a lack of co-operation between towns and communes; a
shortcoming apparent in many other French provinces as they get to grips
with decentralisation.
