FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Tasteful discovery excites
speculation


   By PAUL TAYLOR


It may soon be possible to modify a person's sense of taste, or even to
restore it when it is lost or damaged as the result of illness.
The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley, New Jersey, funded by
the Basel-based Hoffman-La Roche pharmaceuticals group, has made a
breakthrough in understanding how the sense of taste works. The research
team has discovered and cloned a protein which is only found in taste cells.
The new protein is a taste-specific (gustatory) member of a gene family
known as G-proteins which play a crucial signalling role in several types of
cells including those in the brain, eyes and heart.
Potential applications include the development of novel taste modifying
agents and medical uses. Loss of the sense of taste is common after some
illnesses and sometimes occurs as a side effect of drug or radiation
therapy. Hoffman-La Roche: Switzerland, 61 688 8888.
