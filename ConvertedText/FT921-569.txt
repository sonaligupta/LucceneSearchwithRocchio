FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sabena clears hurdle in Air
France deal


BELGIAN legislators yesterday propelled Sabena, the ailing state airline,
further towards its long-awaited partnership with Air France, the French
national carrier, when they approved a law transforming the airline into an
ordinary company, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels.
Officially, the airline is open to any partnership, but Air France is
thought to be the only serious suitor.
The link-up will probably involve Air France injecting some BFr6bn (Dollars
175.4m) into Sabena and taking a 37.5 per cent stake, but a formal decision
has been delayed since last October.
