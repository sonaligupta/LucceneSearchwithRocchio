FT  27 SEP 94 / Newcastle launches plan for city regeneration


   By CHRIS TIGHE


A public and private-sector initiative aimed at bringing jobs and investment
to Newcastle upon Tyne was launched yesterday by the city council.
The city's 1994-7 Economic Regeneration Strategy has been devised in the
past year in consultation with senior executives of more than 50 locally
based companies, academic institutions and other organisations.
It sets out the main challenges Newcastle needs to tackle to be recognised
as an important European regional capital. Its top priority is creating
employment and economic activity.
It acknowledges that the majority of the resources needed to implement the
plan will have to be secured from private investment, kick-started by
considerable public-sector spending.
The initiative identifies three strategic objectives:
Physical development, including improving the city centre, developing high
quality business sites, and enhancing transport and telecommunications
links.
Business development, including job creation, strengthening the
manufacturing sector, reducing crime, improving Newcastle's image and
promoting its arts, sports and tourism sector.
Human resource development, including raising skills and educational
standards, building on the academic sector's strength, tackling poverty and
reducing unemployment.
The strategy proposes promoting Newcastle as a 'European City of Energy', an
allusion both to its liveliness and its energy-related businesses.
Mr Alan Clarke, the city council's chief economic development officer, said
the involvement of so many leading executives gave the strategy much greater
credibility. Partnership was increasingly important in attracting central
government and European funds, he said.
