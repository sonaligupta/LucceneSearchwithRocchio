FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Price increases behind rise to Pounds 142m
at Midlands Electricity


   By JULIET SYCHRAVA


MIDLANDS Electricity, the regional electricity company, yesterday rejected
claims from a consumer organisation that its bumper profits of Pounds 67 per
customer meant it should have frozen prices in April 1991, rather than
increasing them by 10.9 per cent.
On a historical cost basis, Midlands' pre-tax profits for the year to March
31 were Pounds 142.1m, up some 30 per cent from the Pounds 109.7m reported
for 1991. Turnover increased by 9.4 per cent from Pounds 1.33bn to Pounds
1.45bn.
The company said it had cut prices to consumers in real terms this April
when it announced an increase of only 1 per cent. This was in spite of the
fact that costs in its main electricity distribution business had risen 4.5
per cent over the year, said Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman.
The large increase in prices and profits last year arose because the
company, like other regional concerns, had compensated for undercharging the
previous year, Midlands explained.
The supply business, which buys and sells bulk electricity, earned the
second highest profit reported by a regional company so far, at Pounds 8.3m.
Midlands improved operating profits in its retail and contracting
businesses, which made Pounds 1.1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively, compared
with Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 100,000 the previous year. The company's
generation business made a Pounds 1.3m contribution.
Operating profit from the main distribution business improved by 36 per
cent, as tariffs rose and controllable costs fell by 9.3 per cent or 4.7 per
cent excluding interest reductions.
Some 460 jobs have been cut since April 1991, leaving a workforce of about
7,500.
The outlook for the business was good, Midlands said, as sales of
electricity should grow by 0.5 per cent next year, and another 4 per cent is
likely to come off the company's costs.
Earnings per share were 49p against 35.7p last time and a final dividend of
11.6p makes a total for the year of 17.25p (10.5p).
Analysts expect pre-tax profits of between Pounds 157m and Pounds 160m next
year, putting the company on a prospective p/e of 6.8 to 7.5. A dividend of
about 19p is forecast.
COMMENT
Supply profits depend more on formulae set at privatisation than management
acumen - give or take a little clever cost allocation. Even so, if Midlands
can undercharge customers for supply by a cumulative Pounds 37m and still
make money, it will keep return on capital down and please the regulator
without penalising shareholders. Meanwhile, unlike several regional
companies, Midlands has improved retail and contracting profits and is
getting a small profit from its solid generation business. But while its
modest investments in energy service and gas marketing look sensible, some
City observers worry about the company's talk of investing in power stations
overseas, especially when it still has some way to go on customer service
standards at home.
