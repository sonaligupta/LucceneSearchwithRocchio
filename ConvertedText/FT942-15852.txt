FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank tops Pounds 7m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


A steady improvement in domestic demand over the past six months and a 35
per cent increase in overseas sales helped Walker Greenbank, the fabrics and
wallcoverings group, report higher full-year profits yesterday.
Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 increased by 7.7 per cent to
Pounds 7.08m, from a restated Pounds 6.57m the previous year when profits
were flattered by one-off items resulting in a net gain of Pounds 953,000.
Pre-tax profits on a continuing basis increased by 17 per cent.
Earnings per share slipped to 5.1p (5.3p) reflecting a higher tax charge of
Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 1.63m) and increased dividend payments of Pounds 3.28m
(Pounds 2.94m). However, earnings per share on a continuing basis increased
by 14 per cent from 4.49p to 5.1p.
The final dividend is raised to 2.1p (1.9p) making a total for the year of
3.3p (3.1p).
Turnover grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 62m (Pounds 56.2m), including Pounds
2.18m from acquisitions. Overseas sales contributed Pounds 16.1m (Pounds
12m) and now represent 26 per cent of total turnover, up from just 5 per
cent four years ago. Sales of core fabrics and wallcoverings improved 19 per
cent to Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 50.2m).
Operating profits before exceptionals increased 19.5 per cent to Pounds
7.34m, against Pounds 6.14m the previous year when the figure was depressed
by the Pounds 381,000 losses at Bloom Signs, since sold. The underlying
improvement in operating profits reflected advances in both the commercial
and consumer divisions.
Interest costs fell to Pounds 258,000 (Pounds 520,000) and the group ended
the period with net debt of Pounds 700,000 (Pounds 2.9m), equivalent to
gearing of 2.4 per cent.
