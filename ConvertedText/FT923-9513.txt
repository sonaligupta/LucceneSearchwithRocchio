FT  05 AUG 92 / Charities Act timetable outlined


THE Charities Act will come into force in five stages, starting next month
and probably concluding next autumn, Lord Ferrers, a Home Office minister,
announced yesterday.
The act is designed to strengthen the powers of the Charity Commissioners to
investigate and remedy abuse and introduce effective controls over
fund-raising.
The act gives commissioners greater powers to inquire into charities, to
deal with abuse and mismanagement and to protect charity property, including
the power to appoint a receiver and manager for a charity. There will be a
new regime for accounting by charities, and the home secretary will have
power to prescribe the form and content of a charity's statements of
account. It will be an offence to be persistently in default of the
requirements to submit annual reports and accounts to the commissioners.
People convicted of offences involving dishonesty or deception and
undischarged bankrupts will be disqualified from acting as trustees.
