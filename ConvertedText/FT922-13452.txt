FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): Income bonds chaos


Labour's surprise defeat sent the market for guaranteed income bonds into
chaos yesterday. Actuaries were expecting a Labour government, with
attendant higher base rates, and were offering more generous rates
accordingly.
The Tory victory led them to cut rates, or withdraw bonds altogether, in a
hurry. Chase De Vere reports that yesterday Alico, Financial Assurance and
Hambro Guardian withdrew all their bonds. Prosperity and General Portfolio
lowered all their rates, while Liberty Life withdrew its 4-year bond, and
Aetna announced it would withdraw its 5-year bond by Monday morning.
Those who bought GIBs earlier this week will be happy about the situation.
However, the rates on offer on Friday were so unclear that the Weekend FT
was unable to include the bonds in the Best Rates table for this week.
