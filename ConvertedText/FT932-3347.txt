FT  15 JUN 93 / New payphone for people with speech or hearing defects


   By ALAN CANE


A PAYPHONE for people with speech or hearing defects is being tested by
British Telecommunications at six sites in the UK including Heathrow
Airport, Kings Cross station in London and a college for the deaf in
Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Alan Cane writes.
The company said if the trial proved successful it would install the
payphones in sites such as shopping centres and bus and rail stations.
Operated by a BT phonecard, a drawer in the base of the device opens to
reveal a keyboard and two-line screen.
Messages can be sent either to a textphone, BT's existing screen and
keyboard-based system for private subscribers, or to a human operator who
will relay the message to a recipient with normal hearing.
