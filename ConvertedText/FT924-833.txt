FT  22 DEC 92 / Police criticised over cell costs


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


KEEPING prisoners in police cells when there is no prison accommodation
available is costing an average of Pounds 234 a prisoner a day, according to
the National Audit Office.
The NAO is concerned at the failure of police authorities to provide enough
information to justify charges. Claims from 12 authorities, totalling Pounds
30.8m, failed to give more than the overall charge.
The public expenditure watchdog says payments to police authorities for
holding prisoners reached Pounds 94m in 1991-92, up from Pounds 54m the year
before. The NAO has qualified the Home Office prisons accounts for the year
because of 'material uncertainty' over the accuracy and completeness of
claims from police authorities for holding prisoners.
There were large variations in charges for looking after prisoners. The
lowest claim, for Pounds 30 a prisoner day, was from Surrey police for
holding 633 prisoners in June 1991; the largest, from Dyfed-Powys, was
Pounds 2,008 for holding one prisoner for one night.
The police authority charging the most overall was Hertfordshire, at Pounds
561 a prisoner day. Surrey police were the lowest-charging authority at
Pounds 89 a prisoner day.
After concern over the mounting level of claims for holding prisoners, the
Home Office has set up a new system to monitor and check claims.
The number of government accounts qualified because of poor accounting
procedures has doubled in the past three years, according to Sir John Bourn,
the head of the the National Audit Office. In his annual review of the
accounts of government departments, Sir John says government reforms have
exposed weaknesses in management, financial and accounting controls.
Many of the difficulties have arisen when government bodies change their
status (for example become agencies) or when functions are delegated.
