FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mitsui Fudosan hit by slump


   By EMIKO TERAZONO and NEIL WEINBERG


MITSUI Fudosan, Japan's leading real estate company, revealed that
non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year ended March declined for the
first time in 16 years.
The real estate slump has hurt the company severely, and its pre-tax profits
fell 19.4 per cent to Y46.2bn (Dollars 354m). However, overall revenue rose
19.4 per cent to Y881.2bn.
After-tax profit edged down 1.1 per cent to Y29bn. Mitsui blamed the poor
earnings on increased construction costs and heavier interest burdens.
Interest payments surged 22 per cent due to growing debts.
A sharp increase in advertising in a bid to counteract the sluggish property
market conditions also hit the company. Mitsui also faces a new tax burden
of Y7bn, due to the introduction of the new land holding tax in January.
For the current year, Mitsui forecasts a 13.5 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y40bn on revenue of Y900bn.
Fujita Corp, a leading Tokyo redeveloper, reported gains of 20 per cent in
pre-tax profits to Y43.5bn and 5.2 per cent in net profits to Y17.1bn for
the year to end-March, writes Neil Weinberg. Sales advanced 10.2 per cent to
Y820.4bn.
Fujita noted a rise in public works related orders in contrast to a sharp
drop in housing activity and weakness in the construction industry.
Fujita projects sales will rise 10 per cent to Y900bn in the year to March
1993. Pre-tax profits are seen dipping to Y43.5bn while net profits are
expected to rise 8 per cent to Y17.5bn.
