FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Liquidity problems force Turkey
to close bank


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

The Turkish government has closed the small Istanbul-based Turkish Tourism
and Investment Bank (TYT), in the first bank failure for almost a decade.
The move also represents the first casualty of the country's currency
crisis.
The Treasury announced that banking activity and deposit-taking was
suspended at TYT's eight branches. The bank had total assets of TL1,400bn
(Dollars 41.3m) at the end of 1992, the most recent figure available.
Isbank, the semi-autonomous state bank, had been mandated to liquidate the
balance sheet of the bank, with the government promising to pay out up to
TL150m for each depositor from the state insurance scheme.
The collapse stems from liquidity problems at TYT's parent, Lapis Holding, a
company better known for gold trading and tourism. Last July, Lapis agreed
to pay Dollars 213m for Disbank, a trade finance bank.
