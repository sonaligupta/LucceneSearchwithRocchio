FT  13 NOV 93 / Boeing secures Dollars 1.6bn Gulf Air order for 777s


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


BOEING has won a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) order from Gulf Air, the flag
carrier of Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, for up to 12 of its new 777
wide-body airliners.
The deal, involving six firm orders and options for an additional six, is a
blow for the European Airbus consortium which in recent years has won about
70 per cent of new aircraft orders in the Middle East.
But Boeing stepped up marketing efforts in the region and is aiming to take
about 65 per cent of the Middle East airliner market during the next ten
years, says Seddick Belyamani, head of Boeing sales in the region.
Boeing said it had now won about 70 per cent of all new orders in the world
market for wide-body jets since it launched its big twin engine 777
programme three years ago, competing against the Airbus A330 and A340 and
the McDonnell Douglas MD11.
Airbus had already sold six four-engine long-range A340 airliners to Gulf
Air and had been hoping to sell more of its wide-body aircraft.
Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier and Gulf Air's biggest regional
competitor, has also opted for the 777 with firm orders for seven aircraft
and options for another seven.
The Gulf Air deal brings the total 777 firm orders to 136 aircraft with
additional options on 100 aircraft.
Gulf Air has chosen the US General Electric GE90 heavy thrust engines to
power its 777s. This is the engine also selected by British Airways for its
fleet of 777s. The GE90 competes against the Rolls-Royce Trent, which will
power Emirates 777s, and the US Pratt & Whitney PW4000.
For Boeing, the Gulf deal is important. The airliner market continues to
remain depressed, forcing manufacturers to cut production at the same time
as maintaining heavy development spending on new programmes.
Boeing will roll out the first 777 next spring with the first flight
scheduled for June 1994. First delivery of the new widebody will be to
United Airlines of the US in May 1995. Gulf Air will get its first six 777s
between 1997 and 2000 with the six options for delivery after 2000.
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are engaged in combat for a Dollars 6bn
order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian carrier.
