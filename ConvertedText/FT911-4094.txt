FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: Competition over mortgage rate


   By PHILIP COGGAN


HALIFAX Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, cut its
mortgage rate from 13.75 per cent to 12.95 per cent this week, but there is
still enough competition in the market to ensure that it was undercut by
some societies.
Skipton Building Society cut its rate by 0.9 per cent to 12.85 per cent and
the Woolwich made a 0.85 percentage point cut to 12.9 per cent. Existing
Skipton borrowers will have to wait till May 18 for the cut, but borrowers
with Halifax and the Woolwich will benefit from May 1.
However, the two-thirds of Halifax's 1.8m borrowers on the annual review
scheme will continue to pay 14.5 per cent until next year. The 1991-92 rate
was set in February, when base rates were higher.
Halifax offers discounts for larger loans, charging 12.15 per cent
(previously 13.05 per cent) for loans of between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds
99,995, and 11.95 per cent (12.95 per cent) for larger loans. Woolwich
charges 12.15 per cent (13 per cent) for loans above Pounds 60,000.
Halifax is also to offer a customer loyalty bonus of 1 percentage point for
borrowers with a good payment record who move house and stay with the
society. The discount only applies to loans up to 90 per cent of the house's
value.
Both the Halifax and the Woolwich offer first-time buyer discounts - 1.5 per
cent and 1.25 per cent respectively.
The Lloyds, Midland and Barclays Banks all announced cuts yesterday,
bringing down rates by 1.1 per cent to 12.95 per cent as from May 17, from
13.95 to 13.1 per cent as from May 10 and from 13.75 per cent to 12.95 per
cent from June 1, respectively.
Other mortgage changes announced include: Cheshire Building Society is
cutting its rate for existing borrowers by 0.9 per cent to 12.85 per cent as
from May 15. Chelsea Building Society has reduced its mortgage rate by 1 per
cent to 12.5 per cent for new borrowers.
Royal Bank of Scotland has dropped its mortgage rate from 13.85 per cent to
12.95 per cent. The new rate will apply to existing borrowers from May 1 and
to new borrowers immediately. Southdown Building Society has reduced its
rate to 12.75 per cent, with effect from June 1 for existing borrowers and
at once for new borrowers.
Savers take longer to hear of rates changes, but will obviously see
reductions. Halifax has cut its savings rates by up to 1 per cent, although
its tax exempt special savings account rate stays at 14 per cent.
