FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Bagtag keeps track of airport
luggage


   By VANESSA HOULDER


An identification system that was originally devised for sheep-tagging is
being tested in airport baggage handling systems.
Magellan Technology, an Australian company, has developed a radio
frequency-based device that recognises encoded tags. Unlike previous radio
frequency-based systems, it can simultaneously identify a number of tags and
it can operate with the tags in any position.
The developers say the system, known as Bagtag, is nearly 100 per cent
accurate.
