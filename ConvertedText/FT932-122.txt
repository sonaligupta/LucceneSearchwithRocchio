FT  30 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT


All kinds of entertaining theories can be advanced for Granada's decision to
buy a 15 per cent chunk of LWT at a big premium to the market price. The
most dull, and least plausible, is that it is merely a passive trade
investment. A more racy plot line suggests that Granada's nose was put badly
out of joint by LWT's cheeky acquisition of a 14 per cent stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees; the bruised suitor is now seeking greater leverage to
prise its prey free. The more uncertain truth, though, may be that no one
has the faintest idea how far the government will relax the rules
surrounding multiple franchise ownership next year. The big TV companies are
simply piling up all the bargaining chips they can in advance.
Cross-shareholdings are now rapidly multiplying. A grand asset swap may yet
represent the industry's end-game.
Alongside Carlton Communications, Granada is shaping up to be one of the
dominant players in the industry. A future Granada/LWT grouping would
certainly represent a powerful force in ITV, accounting for about 23 per
cent of the network's total revenue. The shares of other ITV contractors
have shot up in anticipation of industry consolidation. Far from settling
the future shape of the ITV network, the government's franchise auctions may
only have proved a temporary staging post.
