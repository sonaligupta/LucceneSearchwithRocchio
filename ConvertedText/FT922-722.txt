FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: European constitutional convention
proposed by the Liberal Democrats


   By RALPH ATKINS


A EUROPEAN Constitutional convention was proposed yesterday by the Liberal
Democrats, Ralph Atkins writes.
Although Liberal Democrats are committed to supporting Maastricht, they
believe the treaty fails to overcome the EC's 'democratic deficit'.
The convention, which the party proposed should be set up in 1995, would
include representatives of the European parliament, national parliaments,
regional governments and the European commission.
