FT  27 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures rally as Brazilian
drought continues - Market Report


   By REUTER


COFFEE futures closed higher on the London Commodity Exchange yesterday,
having rallied after a Brazilian official suggested that continuing drought
meant that his country's 1995-96 coffee crop would be even lower than the
15m bags (60kg each) to which it was estimated to have been reduced by
frosts in June and July.
The November position ended at Dollars 4,080 a tonne, up Dollars 13 from
Friday but Dollars 16 below the day's high.
'We are very worried,' said Mr Frederico Robalinho, secretary at the
Brazilian trade and industry ministry. 'The drought hasn't stopped. We have
to wait for the rain to arrive. We are expecting rain every day.' He was
speaking to reporters during a break in a meeting of the International
Coffee Organisation in London.
At the London Metal Exchange base metals prices continued to drift lower in
afternoon trading after an earlier spike in the COPPER market to a fresh
26-month high of Dollars 2,570 a tonne, for delivery in three months, met
profit-taking and resistance. The price closed at Dollars 2,561.75, down
Dollars 8.75 on the day and lost further ground in after hours trading.
Dealers suggested that copper was still poised to head higher, though it
would have to break resistance around Dollars 2,575 to spark a move towards
Dollars 2,600 a tonne.
ALUMINIUM prices remained under pressure from trade selling, though
technical support and speculative buying appeared near Dollars 1,600 a tonne
for three months metal, which closed at Dollars 1,607.50, down Dollars 24.
NICKEL remained boxed in a narrow range, closing Dollars 20 lower at Dollars
6,527.50 a tonne.
Precious metals turned firmer in Europe during the afternoon after a bout of
short-selling ahead of the New York opening took markets lower.
GOLD closed at Dollars 395.95 a troy ounce, down just 5 cents and well off
the day's low. Weekend news that Britain was to propose IMF gold sales to
help ease poor-nation debt sparked short-selling in the early afternoon.
