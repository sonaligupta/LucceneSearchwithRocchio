FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases back after
renewed political wrangling


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


Continued political wrangling over the selection of a new prime minister
left share prices easier on profit-taking, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average fell 73.21 to 19,987.20 after a low of 19,847.97 and
a high of 20,169.13. Shares fell in the morning on arbitrage linked selling,
before rising later on rumours that public funds will be allotted to trust
banks today. Later profit taking eroded most of the gains.
Traders said that investors were still worried by the political situation
which has failed to stabilise. Although the seven coalition parties seemed
to be in accord in backing Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, as the
next prime minister, the New Harbinger Party, on the coalition's left wing,
yesterday refused to enter negotiations.
Analysts said that investors would be reluctant to return to the stock
market while the political situation remained fluid.
Volume totaled 368.5m shares against 339m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.59 to 1,623.48, while the
Nikkei 300 ended 1.04 higher at 297.39. Advances led declines by 529 to 457
with 179 issues unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.99 to 1,329.07.
Low priced shipping shares, seen as laggards, improved with Showa Line, the
day's most active issue, rising Y7 to Y273 and Navix Line gaining Y8 to
Y372.
Automobile companies and component manufacturers were higher on expectations
of increased domestic and US car sales. Nissan Motor gained Y14 to Y884 and
Kayaba Industry jumped Y30 to Y570.
Profit-taking depressed some high-technology issues: NEC fell Y20 to Y1,130
and Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,030.
Oils rose were higher on hopes of higher earnings due to economic recovery
with Teikoku Oil rising rose Y16 to Y758 and Nippon Oil gained Y2 to Y727.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 102.18 to 22,291.40 in volume of 14.7m
shares. High-technology shares were bought, with Konami, the game maker,
rising Y120 to Y3,600. However, Nintendo lost Y140 to Y6,660 on
profit-taking.
