FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Deficit of top credit agencies passes
Dollars 50bn


   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor


THE ACCUMULATED deficit of the world's leading export credit agencies passed
Dollars 50bn (Pounds 30.6bn) in 1991, according to the Berne Union, which
represents the world's top 41 agencies.
A total of 49 countries failed to meet fully their repayment obligations
under debt restructuring arrangements, up from 46 in 1990, the Union
revealed at the end of its latest annual meeting.
This was 'a matter of continuing concern', Mr Ragnar Sohlman, Berne Union
president, said in a statement that provided data on the agencies'
accumulated deficits for the first time.
The 'adverse payments climate' continued in 1991, resulting in claims from
exporters rising to Dollars 13bn, and recoveries from defaulting buyers
falling to Dollars 3.9bn.
A Berne Union official refused to unveil comparative figures for 1990, but
said that the total for recoveries was only marginally lower than in 1990.
Confirmation that the combined cumulative deficit of export insurers
continues to rise is a factor likely to increase pressure on agencies to
enforce more rigorous risk-assessment methods, and in some cases to raise
export credit premiums.
Mr Sohlman said the 41 export credit agencies, from a total of 33 countries,
underwrote Dollars 340bn in new business in 1991, a rise of 3.5 per cent on
1990.
As in previous years, 80 per cent of this was for commodities, raw materials
and consumer goods which were sold on short-term credit terms, sums normally
repaid within six months.
Total exposure under insurance and direct lending programmes amounted to
Dollars 459bn, a rise of 6 per cent from 1990 after currency fluctuations
have been taken into account.
'The recovery of debts from countries in course of fragmenting pose
additional problems,' Mr Sohlman added.
'So do the softer terms, involving the write-off of part of the debts of the
poorest countries, agreed in the Paris Club (of leading creditor nations).'
Of the union's 41 members, 20 provide insurance against political risks
linked with investing overseas.
New underwriting for foreign investments amounted to Dollars 4.8bn in 1991,
up from just over Dollars 3bn in 1990.
Cumulative underwriting for investment insurance amounted to Dollars 19.3bn,
a 12.5 per cent increase on 1990.
