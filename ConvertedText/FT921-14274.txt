FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp to shed Ambac holding


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


CITICORP, the biggest US bank that has been struggling to bolster its
capital and contain loan losses, last night began preparing for the possible
sale of its remaining 49.7 per cent shareholding in Ambac, the municipal
bond insurance business, writes Alan Friedman.
Citicorp said Ambac had lodged a filing with the Securities & Exchange
Commission (SEC) saying it may offer all or part of the 17.4m shares now
owned by Citicorp. At yesterday's share price of Dollars 32 3/4 , that would
place a market value of Dollars 569.9m on Citicorp's 49.7 per cent of Ambac.
Last July, Citicorp sold 50.3 per cent of Ambac, once a crown jewel in the
bank's portfolio, for Dollars 352m.
