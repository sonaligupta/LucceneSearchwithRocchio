FT  20 APR 91 / Thai talks on patent piracy


   By NANCY DUNNE


   WASHINGTON


THE Thai government will meet US trade officials next week in an undisclosed
third country in the hope of averting trade retaliation for Bangkok's
failure to act against patent and copyright piracy.
The Thais are already facing retaliation on complaints filed by the US
pharmaceutical industry, over lack of patent enforcement, the Recording
Industry Association and the Intellectual Property Alliance. This last
accuses the Thai authorities of ignoring documented evidence of big
video-tape piracy in Bangkok.
However, they seem more anxious to avoid being named on the 'Special 301'
list of top Violators of intellectual property rights, to be published by
the US trade representative next Friday.
Unless their governments make last-minute concessions, Thailand, China,
India and Indonesia are expected to be named for failing to protect patents
or copyrights. They could face sanctions six months hence.
