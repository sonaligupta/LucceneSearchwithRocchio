FT  30 OCT 93 / Asda freezes grocery prices


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


ASDA, THE food retailer, yesterday fuelled speculation about a new round of
supermarket price wars by freezing more than 5,000 grocery prices until next
January.
Retail food stocks came under pressure in a second successive day of heavy
trading. Kwik Save fell 9p to 642p, Sainsbury closed 6 1/2 p off at 395 1/2
p, Tesco slipped 3 1/2 p to 203p and Asda was 1 1/2 p lower at 54p.
Mr Allan Leighton, Asda's marketing director, said the move was to mark the
anni-versary of the relaunch of the 'Asda price' advertising slogan.
City analysts said Asda's move was less a response to any threat from the
Costco warehouse club project than an attempt to regain market share from
existing rivals. It was likely to put pressure on other supermarkets to hold
prices down, however.
One analyst said: 'We are not going to see many price rises in the
supermarkets.'
