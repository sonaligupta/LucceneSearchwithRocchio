FT  08 NOV 94 / Consumer credit falls in September


   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor


Consumer demand for credit eased in September, but official statistics
published yesterday show consumer credit at or near records in the third
quarter.
The Central Statistical Office reported that net lending to consumers by
finance houses, through unsecured lending from building societies and on
bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, fell to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 479m in September from a record Pounds 632m in
August.
But the monthly consumer credit figures - known as the CSO's narrow coverage
 -are notoriously erratic. Statistics for the three months to the end of
September suggested steady growth of consumer credit demand.
Net lending on the narrow measure reached a record Pounds 1.46bn in the
third quarter compared with Pounds 1.27bn in the three months to the end of
June and Pounds 959m in the third quarter of last year.
This mainly reflected record net lending by finance houses to consumers of
Pounds 1.19bn in the latest three months after Pounds 996m in the second
quarter. There was only a modest increase in net lending on bank credit
cards to Pounds 245m from Pounds 234m, while consumer credit from building
societies slipped to Pounds 24m from Pounds 41m.
Most gross figures for credit business were also at record levels. The CSO
said the Pounds 5.28bn 'narrow' total of credit advanced in September was a
new high, up from Pounds 5.26bn in August. It reflected record advances of
credit through bank credit cards and by finance houses of Pounds 3.02bn and
Pounds 2.04bn respectively.
The total of new credit granted on the narrow measure in the third quarter
rose to a record Pounds 15.68bn from Pounds 15.11bn in the previous three
months.
Third-quarter figures for the CSO's broader consumer credit coverage, which
includes lending by banks on personal accounts, insurance companies,
retailers and on all bank credit cards and charge cards, were at their
highest since the boom in the late 1980s. Net lending rose to a five-year
high of Pounds 1.53bn in the quarter from Pounds 1.34bn in the previous
three months.
The broad coverage, which has been available only quarterly, will be the
basis of the monthly credit figures from January 6, when the Bank of England
will take responsibility for publication and the CSO's present narrow
coverage will be dropped.
The narrow figures published yesterday showed that net lending by finance
houses slipped to Pounds 381m in September from Pounds 486m in August. Net
lending through bank credit cards declined to Pounds 102m from Pounds 125m,
while there was a net repayment of Pounds 4m of consumer borrowing from
building societies after net lending of Pounds 21m in August.
