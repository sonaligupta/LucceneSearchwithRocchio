FT  16 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JOEL KIBAZO


DERIVATIVE markets saw one of their busiest sessions in recent weeks, as
turnover in both equity futures and traded options soared to high levels,
writes Joel Kibazo.
In Footsie futures, the squeeze in the March contract, up to around 2,600
early in the session, soon gave way to heavy institutional selling as
dealers tried to avoid being left with long positions.
That selling continued for most of the day, further prompted by the poor
opening in the US bond market and on Wall Street, though March saw a modest
rally in the dying minutes of the session.
March closed at 2,579, up 18 on the previous day and around 20 points above
its estimated fair value premium to cash of 22. Turnover reached 9,157
contracts.
In traded options, volume swelled to 51,352 lots, well exceeding Tuesday's
29,608.
Asda, which reported big interim losses, was the busiest stock option. It
had 10,641 contracts dealt, with the April 43 calls the busiest series.
Hanson, also heavily traded in the underlying market, was the second most
active stock option with 3,558 lots transacted. This was followed by Boots
with 1,783 contracts and Scottish & Newcastle with a day's total of 1,600
lots.
