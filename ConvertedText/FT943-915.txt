FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Intemperate


   From Mr BRIAN KNOX


Sir, I admire almost all Colin Amery's contributions, even when he omits
cost as the prime reason why so few people commission architects to build
new houses in England. But his outburst against architectural competitions
is intemperate, ill-timed and wrong ('The tyranny of the few', September
26). It could have been written any time in the last century and a half;
what clearer target than that arch-conceptualist, Pugin? At least you gave
equal prominence (Arts, September 24) to William Packer's admirable plea for
professional judgment in the award of artists' prizes.
