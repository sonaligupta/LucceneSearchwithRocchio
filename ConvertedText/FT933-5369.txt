FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Grafton falls to IPounds 1.21m


PROFITS of Grafton Group, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY
concern, fell from IPounds 1.85m to Pounds IPounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.13m) for
the half year ended June 30.
Turnover was static at IPounds 48.6m but interest charges were reduced from
IPounds 698,000 to Pounds 480,000 because of a lower level of debt and
transactions in financial markets, the directors explained.
Although earnings per share fell to 5.6p (8.6p) the interim dividend is
lifted from 2.75p to 3p.
Directors said an improving trend in profitability evident in the second
quarter had continued in July and August.
They added that there was 'evidence of some recovery' in the Irish and UK
housing markets which would benefit the merchanting and manufacturing
businesses.
A continuing improvement in trading on the DIY side was also expected.
