FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: BankAmerica fails to keep up
with sector gains


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


BANKAMERICA, the second biggest US bank, saw only a slight improvement in
second-quarter earnings compared with the first three months of the year.
The bank was held back by the slow economic recovery in California, its home
market.
It recorded second-quarter net income of Dollars 488m, or Dollars 1.20 a
share, compared with Dollars 484m, or Dollars 1.19, in the first three
months.
In the second quarter of 1992 it returned post-tax profits of Dollars 240m,
after restructuring charges following its merger with Security Pacific.
Excluding non-recurring factors, net income in the second quarter of 1992
was Dollars 421m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, the company said.
The gains were less than those shown recently by other big US banks, which
have generally seen a faster improvement in credit quality and bigger gains
in trading revenues.
Mr Richard Rosenberg, chairman, called the figures 'encouraging' and pointed
to improved credit quality in its loan portfolio and 'higher levels of
customer activity in some market segments to-wards the end of the quarter'.
He added that economic conditions, particularly in California, were likely
to limit revenue growth, leading to greater attention to the bank's costs.
Net interest before provisions for credit losses of Dollars 200m (down from
Dollars 235m in the first quarter and Dollars 240m a year ago) was Dollars
1.85bn, an increase of Dollars 9m over the first quarter.
By the end of June the bank held Dollars 996m of assets intended for sale,
Dollars 890m less than three months ago largely as a result of a bulk sale
of properties to a Morgan Stanley property fund.
Non-interest income fell by Dollars 31m during the quarter to Dollars
1.05bn, although this was more than accounted for by Dollars 38m of
non-recurring gains in the earlier period.
