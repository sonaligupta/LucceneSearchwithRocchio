FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: British Gas - monopoly and costs at issue


   From Mr E R STEIN


Sir, Lex comments ('British Gas', June 22) that 'figures (on rate of return)
around 4.5 per cent for existing assets and 7 to 8 per cent for new
investment look sensible'. No wonder that the issue which excites British
Gas most is its desire to retain the pipelines. This seems to rank in
importance above everything else, even the domestic market.
Maybe Lex has been able to unravel British Gas's cost base to conclude this.
Without full inspection of British Gas's costs and its apportionment to
different aspects of the business - as well as answers to many of the other
strategic issues which are central to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
inquiry - to sympathise with British Gas and its rate of return arguments
would be to fall into a ready trap. The result would be potentially damaging
effects on the developing competitive structure of the industry and to the
detriment of the price of gas paid by end-consumers.
