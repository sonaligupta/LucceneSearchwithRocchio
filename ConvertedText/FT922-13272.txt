FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Sulzer profits fall 23% to SFr119m

   GENEVA


SULZER, the Swiss engineering group, has revealed a 23 per cent fall in last
year's net consolidated earnings to SFr119m (Dollars 78.8m) from SFr155m in
1990. Turnover was up 4 per cent to SFr6.5bn.
The company blamed the profits fall on 'serious losses' at the Sulzer Ruti
weaving machinery division. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions,
the three divisions concerned with medical technology, plant and building
services, and paper technology, hydraulics and turbines ended the year 'with
very good results'. The Winterthur power systems and locomotive works also
achieved a good result despite high losses in foundry operations.
Net earnings of the parent company, Sulzer Brothers, fell to SFr48m in 1991
from SFr60m in 1990.
The board proposes to cut the dividend to SFr130 from SFr150 per registered
share with a nominal value of SFr1,000, and to SFr13 from SFr15 for
registered shares and participation certificates with a par value of SFr100.
In March the company said it was opening its share ledger to foreigners. The
annual meeting in May will be asked to approve a 10-for-1 share split of
registered shares with a nominal value of SFr1,000.
In January Sulzer said orders for the group had risen 2 per cent in 1991 to
SFr6.4bn, but this mainly reflected strong growth for the medical technology
division, Sulzermedica. Orders for weaving machinery and foundries fell.
SMH (Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie), the Swiss
watchmaker best known for the Swatch plastic watch and Omega and Rado luxury
brands, boosted net consolidated earnings by 32 per cent to SFr252m in 1991.
Turnover rose 10.9 per cent to SFr2.37bn, while sales of watches and
movements jumped 34 per cent.
