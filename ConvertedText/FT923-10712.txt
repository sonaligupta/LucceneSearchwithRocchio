FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: New policy for finance
advisers in US


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a new policy requiring
foreign investment advisers to comply with US securities laws only when they
deal with clients based in the US, Reuter reports from Washington.
The plan was approved in a 4-0 vote by the agency's commissioners. It will
make it easier for US investors to get advice from foreign advisers.
Under the new approach, foreign advisers registered with the SEC will be
subject to their home country law, rather than US law, when giving advice to
clients in their home country. The policy will apply as long as a foreign
adviser's conduct does not affect US clients or US markets.
The SEC also agreed to permit foreign advisers not registered with the SEC
greater flexibility to organise subsidiaries that are registered advisers.
