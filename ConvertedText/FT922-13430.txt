FT  11 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Defending the ditch


I LIVE in a listed property which I have owned for 34 years. I have been in
occupation for the whole of that time. During that time the southern
boundary has been a bank and ditch, both on my side of the dividing fence.
My neighbour is laying claim to the bank and ditch, saying that the fence is
in the wrong place. Can I claim that even if the bank and ditch were
formerly my neighbour's, it is now my property through occupation over more
than 20 years?
Yes, you will have acquired title by adverse possession for more than 12
years, under sections 15 and 17 of the Limitation Act 1980.
