FT  19 MAY 92 / Indonesian voters face jamborees

INDONESIA'S strict election code, which includes a ban on political party
supporters forming a convoy of more than three vehicles, yesterday lay in
tatters.
Hundreds of motorcycles, their riders and passengers waving the red flag of
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), trawled the streets of Jakarta,
honking horns, wailing slogans at bemused pedestrians and generally having a
political ball.
Members of the ruling Golkar party, in power since 1972, have promised not
to make empty promises during the campaign and have turned their rallies
into jamborees instead. Campaign podiums have been occupied mostly by
singers and dancers, with the occasional politician making a short political
statement.
The use of such an approach is questionable. Many of the bikers supporting
PDI, dressed in red T-shirts emblazoned with PDI's symbol of a discontented
bull, were youngsters ineligible to vote at the June 9 poll.
The local press has been calling on the government to allow greater
political expression and an end to entertainment rallies.
'I'd prefer three votes, then I could give one to each party. They're all
the same,' complained a businessman.
