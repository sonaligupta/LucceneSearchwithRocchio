A huge blast likened by local residents to an atomic explosion has killed up
to 70 people and injured many others in the southern Chinese economic zone
of Shenzhen, writes Tony Walker in Beijing.
Xinhua, China's official news agency, reported that a succession of
explosions had rocked Shenzhen city early yesterday afternoon.
Sources in Shenzhen, on the border with Hong Kong, said the heat from an
initial explosion in a nitric acid storage facility ignited a second, larger
detonation in a gas storage plant nearby. Some 200 people are reported to
have been admitted to hospital.
