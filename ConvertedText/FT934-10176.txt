FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Nikkei at lowest since March - At a
glance


Tokyo's Nikkei stock market index fell to its lowest level since March,
closing at 18,590.46 on Friday, as a combination of factors hit market
confidence. The weakening economy has been a worry, and corporate
developments did not help. The failure of Muramoto Construction, the largest
company collapse since the war, contributed to the gloom.
Some of the market's weakness was blamed on last week's partial flotation of
JR East, the semi-privatised railway group. The exchange's computer trading
system was jammed by the weight of buy orders, discouraging investors, and
leading to a sharp decline in the share's price.
