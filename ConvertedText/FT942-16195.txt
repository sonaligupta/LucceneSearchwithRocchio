FT  12 APR 94 / Scots oppose six-group merger


   By ANDREW JACK


The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland yesterday came out
strongly against proposals for a merger of the UK's six professional bodies,
Andrew Jack writes.
In a letter sent to its members recently and made public yesterday, Mr Nigel
Macdonald, the outgoing president, said he rejected recommendations unveiled
last month to rationalise the profession. He said proposals for change would
be more costly than the existing structure, and called instead for more
modest 'harmonisation' and closer co-operation between the bodies.
The comments follow opposition already voiced to a merger by the Chartered
Association of Certified Accountants last month.
The statement came after more than a year's work on rationalisation by a
sub-committee of the six professional organisations which comprise the
Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies. The sub-committee recommended
a shift from six bodies to three geographical chartered institutes with a
series of specialist sub-groups in each.
