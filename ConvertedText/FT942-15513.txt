FT  14 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick dips on placing


   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


By far the day's biggest event on the London market, the placing of a 21 per
cent stake in Sedgwick, the UK's biggest insurance broker, took place within
an hour of the market opening.
The stake, 114.5m shares, was sold by Transamerica International, the US
group, to Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, and SG Warburg Securities
for 191p a share and subsequently placed with a number of UK, European and
US institutions at 193p a share, giving the two purchasers of the stock a
profit of around Pounds 230,000 on the deal.
Insurance analysts said much of the stock was pre-placed by the two brokers
after the market closed on Tuesday and the remainder easily placed early
yesterday.
Transamerica has been keen to exit the property and casualty insurance
industry for some time and moved quickly to take advantage of the recent
upturn in the insurance broking sector.
Sedgwick shares dipped to 196p following the placing and later edged up to
close a net 15 off at 198p. Turnover reached 236m shares.
