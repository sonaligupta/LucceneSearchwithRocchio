FT  23 APR 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring costs hold Etam to 3%
improvement


   By ROLAND RUDD


THE ABSENCE of defence costs helped Etam, the fashion retailer, to report a
3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year ended January 30.
Profits rose from Pounds 10.7m to Pounds 10.9m on increased sales of Pounds
221m (Pounds 213m).
Last year Etam spent Pounds 1.2m on successfully repelling a 185p a share
bid from Oceana Investment Corporation of South Africa, which acquired a 34
per cent stake. Etam's shares yesterday rose 10p to 228p.
Operating profits slipped to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 11.9m). Mr Keith Miles,
finance director, said: 'I hoped it could have been a better year but we are
only just coming out of the recession.'
Mr Miles criticised the decision of Oceana to show 34.4 per cent of the
company's profits as its own. 'They should not have equity accounted since
they have no influence on us whatsoever.'
Equity accounting requires a shareholder to have 'significant influence'
over the company in which it has a holding. Etam has refused Oceana's
request for boardroom representation.
Etam, which caters for women and girls, is getting out of its loss-making
mens' wear division which accounted for less than 5 per cent of sales. This
resulted in a Pounds 431,000 restructuring charge.
The loss on disposal of fixed assets, which included withdrawing from a shop
with high rent, was Pounds 752,000 (Pounds 552,000).
Capital expenditure increased to Pounds 12.6m (Pounds 3.1m) while net assets
rose to Pounds 76.1m (Pounds 73.9m).
Earnings per share were 10.29p (9.42p). The proposed final dividend is
raised to 5.25p giving an increased total of 6.9p (6.6p).
COMMENT
Etam had taken the precaution of making sure its somewhat disappointing
results came as no surprise. The difficult second half led to higher
mark-downs, resulting in lower operating profits. The future looks more
promising. It has now taken a number of steps to improve the bottom line,
including closing the loss-making mens' wear operations and withdrawing from
a shop charging an exorbitant rent. With continuing uncertainty in South
Africa, Oceana is unlikely to sell its 34.4 per cent stake, which is just as
well for Etam since it would not want it sold to a UK predator. With the end
of the recession in sight the group is forecast to make full year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 14.5m, giving earnings per share of 13.9p. The shares look
fairly priced on a prospective multiple of 16.2.
