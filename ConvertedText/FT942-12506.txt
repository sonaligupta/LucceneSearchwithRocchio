FT  29 APR 94 / Sinclair gives bikes a push


Sir Clive Sinclair, inventor of the ill-fated C5 car and the Zike electric
bicycle, yesterday unveiled his latest brainwave - a battery-powered motor
for push bikes to take the work out of going uphill.
The Zeta (Zero Emission Transport Accessory) attaches over the rear wheel
and is activated by a switch on the handlebars. Sinclair Research says it
can be strapped on almost any standard bike.
Sir Clive said the Zeta would be 'the next major breakthrough' in the
bicycle market, and that it can supply half the power needed for a 12-stone
person to go up a one-in-10 gradient at 10mph.
The Zeta, which weighs less than 10lb, transmits the drive by a
pulley-mounted belt. This minimises friction to prevent tyre wear, unlike
petrol-driven motors.
The rechargeable battery gives a range of one to three hours, or 10 to 30
miles. An overnight recharger comes as part of the package.
The Zeta costs Pounds 144.95 mail-order and will be advertised in national
newspapers this weekend. It is expected to be in the shops by the autumn.
In contrast, the Zike is a bike with a completely integrated electric motor
and battery. It costs Pounds 499 and has sold 2,000 since its launch in
1992.
Olympic cycle designer Mr Mike Burrows was sure there was a market for Zeta.
'It's for little old ladies in Hampstead who are a bit worried about getting
back up the hill,' he said.
'Serious cyclists wouldn't need it and kids will get bored with it and wreck
it in no time. But there is a market.'
