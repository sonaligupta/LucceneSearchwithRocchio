FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: PCT looks for growth overseas


An increasing emphasis on overseas markets enabled PCT Group, the
Glasgow-based engineering equipment maker, to report static results for
1993.
On turnover of Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 20.5m) pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.47m
(Pounds 1.4m). Earnings per share were 11.28p (10.46p) and the final
recommended dividend is held at 4.75p for a maintained total of 7.25p.
The company said that the continuing recession in the UK resulted in sales
falling by 7.3 per cent. However, there was a 'significant' increase in
exports which accounted for 24.1 per cent of total sales against the
previous year's 15.3 per cent.
The shares are quoted on the USM.
