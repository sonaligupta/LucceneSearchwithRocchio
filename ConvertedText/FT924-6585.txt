FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Bank down 40% in 'tough year' -
Bad debts hit National Australia's subsidiaries


   By MATTHEW CURTIN


YORKSHIRE BANK, a sub-sidiary of National Australia Bank, yesterday reported
a 40 per cent drop, from Pounds 107m to Pounds 64.6m, in pre-tax profit in
the 12 months to September 30 following a steep rise in the provision for
bad debt.
Mr David Knight, chief executive, said the bank had pulled through a tough
year, but confidence last November that loan loss provisions would not rise
significantly had proved misplaced.
The charge for bad debts jumped from Pounds 76.1m to Pounds 133.9m.
Mr Knight said: 'There was a degree of optimism at the start of the year,
but not only was there no recovery, conditions deteriorated. In addition, we
felt the impact of the recession moving north.'
However, he said the bank's retail business performed well, increasing its
share of core markets and tightening its control of costs.
Total assets were Pounds 4.24bn (Pounds 4.41bn).
The cost/income ratio was 46.7 per cent, compared with 47.5 per cent, which
Mr Knight said confirmed Yorkshire's position as a low cost operator.
The balance sheet remained strong with tier 1 and tier 2 capital at 6.8 per
cent and 2.8 per cent of total assets respectively.
The bank's branch network continued to expand, with five new branches opened
in King's Lynn, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Telford and Stevenage.
Belfast-based Northern Bank, another subsidiary of National Australia, also
suffered an increase in bad debt provisions.
They amounted to Pounds 7.61m (Pounds 4.69m) but were described by Sir
Desmond Lorimer, chairman, as 'well below the norm for clearing banks in the
British Isles'.
There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 7.85m (Pounds 1.5m), to leave
pre-tax profit down 26 per cent at Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 58.6m).
The exceptional charge covered a judgment in the Irish High Court in respect
of a claim brought by a Norwegian bank, relating to a foreign trade
transaction originating in 1986 in the Republic.
An appeal has been lodged.
'We are weathering the recession well' Sir Desmond added. 'We have a
dominant position in the market-place, an asset book of sound quality and a
strong capital position.'
