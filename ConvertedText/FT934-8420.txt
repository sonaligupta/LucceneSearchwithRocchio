FT  16 NOV 93 / Names accept Pounds 1.77m for losses


   By RICHARD LAPPER


NEARLY 500 Lloyd's Names yesterday won Pounds 1.77m in compensation for
their insurance losses after agreeing to accept an out-of-court settlement
offered by the Aragorn Agencies and its errors-and-omissions insurers,
Richard Lapper writes.
Under the offer Aragorn and its insurers, which cover legal awards for
negligence, acknowledged that the Names should not have been responsible for
83 per cent of the losses incurred on one particular contract underwritten
by Aragorn syndicate 384.
'This is a significant success,' said Sir Michael Bunbury, chairman of the
Aragorn Action group, which represents 494 of the 633 Names - individuals
whose assets support the market - on syndicate 384 in the 1985 year of
account.
Names will also receive substantial interest and legal expenses, said Sir
Michael. The Names have lost Pounds 13.8m on business underwritten in 1985
but took legal action over a specific reinsurance contract underwritten in
1984 by Mr Graham Potter, the 384 underwriter. The case had been due to come
to court next month.
Separately in the opening day of a court action against four Names Lloyd's
denied that it owed a contractual duty to Names to act in good faith.
The Names are resisting writs issued by Lloyd's to draw down their deposits
in order to meet insurance losses. This week's hearing before Mr Justice
Saville concerns a series of preliminary issues.
Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor representing the four Names, said the
admission was 'both surprising and startling'. He said it contradicted
statements by Lloyd's in other legal actions against Names.
Lloyd's explained: 'Lloyd's is denying that as a matter of contract it owes
the implied contractual duties pleaded against it. The duties alleged
include an implied duty of good faith.'
