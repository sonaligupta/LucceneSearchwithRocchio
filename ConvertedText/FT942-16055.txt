FT  12 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Third mortgage backed deal by
Barclays Bank


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


Barclays Bank has launched a Pounds 281.8m issue of mortgage-backed
securities, arranged by BZW. This is the third securitisation completed by
Barclays, which was the first major UK bank to securitise its mortgages in
1989.
Securitisation allows institutions to remove mortgages from their balance
sheets and repackage them as bonds.
The issue is backed by 7,400 mortgages selected from Barclays Direct
Mortgage Service, the bank's third-party introduced mortgage business. The
offering consists of Pounds 270m of senior notes with an average life of 3
1/2 years, which will yield  1/4 point above the London interbank offered
rate (Libor), and Pounds 11.8m of junior notes.
'Securitisation aids balance sheet and portfolio management,' said Mr
Patrick Perry, Barclays' group treasurer.
