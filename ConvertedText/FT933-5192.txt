FT  04 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gen Accident firm


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


News that the Halifax building society is setting up its own life assurance
business after cutting its ties with Standard Life, and has also negotiated
a service agreement with General Accident, helped the latter's shares
stabilise and recoup some of the substantial ground they lost earlier in the
week. The shares settled 12 higher at 669p after turnover of 1.1m.
Along with other composite insurance shares, GenAcc have been among the
market's best performers since the middle of the year. Since the end of May,
GenAcc shares have risen from 557p to a peak 699p, a gain of almost 22 per
cent.
This week, however, saw the emergence of some determined selling pressure in
the composites, as the big institutions shifted funds out of what some
analysts see as an overbought sector. The Halifax link was viewed as some
much needed good news for a sector that has been given a rough ride in the
last few sessions, analysts said.
Marketmakers were not surprised at the emergence of profit-taking in both
classes of Schroders shares after the merchant bank announced an increased
interim dividend and said profits for the first half were higher than in the
same period of 1992.
Schroders shares have spiralled upwards, notably during the past couple of
weeks, as the market anticipated good trading news. Yesterday saw the
non-voters dip 10 to 1295p and the ordinaries 20 to 1303p. 'After the
excellent profits news from the likes of BZW, Kleinwort Benson, Smith New
Court, NatWest Markets and others, it would have been a major shock if
Schroders had adopted a bearish line on their interims,' said a banks
specialist.
Hambros was the pick of the merchant banks, surging 15 to 368p, after 371p.
SG Warburg put on 4 to 812p.
A Smith New Court buy recommendation was responsible for the strength in
Royal Bank of Scotland, which advanced 11 to 288p on heavy turnover of 7.3m.
London Scottish Bank jumped 7 1/2 to 111 1/2 p, after 113 1/2 p, after the
company confirmed it had received an approach which could led to a bid for
the company. Names put forward as potential bidders included Provident
Financial and Cattles Holdings.
Profit-takers moved into the drugs sector following Thursday's strong rises.
Yesterday, Glaxo lost 18 to 618p, Wellcome 6 to 749p and Zeneca 4 to 756p.
They had risen on the back of speculation that US healthcare reforms, due
within the next two months, would not demand mandatory price controls on
prescription drugs.
Sparkling results from Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, saw the
shares put on 6 to 519p.
Turnover in WPP reached 105m as the advertising group converted 51.47m
preference shares into 58m ordinary shares. Company broker SG Warburg was
believed to have placed 47m shares in the market at 93 pence per share. WPP
closed 7 up at 102p.
Comment on the BSkyB satellite television expansion helped Granada Group,
ahead 7 at 440p. Thorn EMI gained 2 to 1004p.
News that Dr Pepper, the giant US soft drinks group, is to put in place a
'poison pill' to discourage a full takeover attempt by Cadbury Schweppes,
hit shares in the UK company. They closed 10 down at 474, although turnover
was below average. Last week, Cadbury raised its holding in Dr Pepper to
25.9 per cent. Dr Pepper has since approved a plan whereby all shareholders
other then Cadbury would be allowed to buy one new share at half price for
every share already owned, should Cadbury raise its holding further.
Asda finally responded to this week's positive sentiment on the stock, which
included a NatWest buy note and visit from Cazenove. The shares finished 2
1/2 up at 67p. J Sainsbury also recovered slightly, up 2 at 501p, although
Tesco was again undermined by renewed price war fears, closing 2 down at
224p.
Good news about current trading is expected at Siebe's annual meeting on
Monday and the shares finished 18 better at 532p. Negative sentiment
following Thursday's figures and rights issue led to heavy trading in
Rolls-Royce. Volume soared to 12m as the shares lost another 4 to 148 1/2 p.
Reports that August car sales figures, due out today, will show a 16 per
cent increase on a year ago boosted several motor stocks. These included Lex
Service, up 9 at 417p, T Cowie which also finished 9 ahead at 262p, and Reg
Vardy which put on 10 to 174p.
