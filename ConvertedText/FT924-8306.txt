FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Trading halted in US drug group

   NEW YORK


SHARES in Warner-Lambert, a large US pharmaceuticals company, were halted in
late NYSE trading yesterday following news that an encouraging study on the
company's tacrine drug for Alzheimer's disease would be presented in today's
issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
The preliminary results of the study, called 970-26, were presented in July
at a conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Padua. It found that
Warner-Lambert's tacrine, known as Cognex, had statistically significant
results over a placebo in 'primary outcome measures' used to evaluate the
effects of a drug on Alzheimer's.
Warner-Lambert hopes the study will help in its efforts to have Cognex
approved by the Food & Drug Administration. Twice last year, an FDA advisory
committee decided not to recommend approval of the drug amid concerns about
its efficacy.
