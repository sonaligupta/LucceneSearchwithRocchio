FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Scots reject Tories


CONSERVATIVE support in Scotland has fallen to 18 per cent, according to an
opinion poll for The Scotsman newspaper and Channel Four released last
night.
Tory support has fallen from 23 per cent in January, the ICM figures show.
Labour and the Liberal Democrats have both risen by one percentage point to
42 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The Scottish National party is up
two points to 28 per cent.
The figures imply five seats for the Tories compared with 10 after the 1987
election. Losses would include Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary and MP for
Galloway.
