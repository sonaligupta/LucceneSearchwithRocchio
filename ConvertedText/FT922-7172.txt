FT  20 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: TI/Dowty


Dowty has so little ammunition with which to defend itself against TI that a
sparkling profits estimate for the financial year which ended in March was
almost inevitable. The company appears to have reaped an early harvest from
its reorganisation efforts and to have benefited from a spurt in demand
during the final quarter. The trouble is that there is not much flesh on the
bones. It is difficult to see where its estimate leaves the outlook for the
current year, especially since there is not much sign of recovery elsewhere
in the sector.
Admittedly, there is some justification to Dowty's arguments about the lack
of TI's industrial fit. But TI looks likely to be a more determined seller
of the electronics and information technology business, and it has an
underwritten offer of 175p on the table. Small wonder the market behaves as
if it expects TI to win.
