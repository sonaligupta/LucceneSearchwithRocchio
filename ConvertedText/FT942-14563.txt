FT  20 APR 94 / Nixon in hospital after serious stroke


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


Former President Richard Nixon was reported to be in stable condition in a
New York hospital yesterday after suffering a serious stroke at his New
Jersey home while preparing for dinner on Monday evening.
Doctors reported that he was alert, but unable to speak and paralysed down
the right side of the body. They promised a clearer public prognosis within
24 hours. His wife, Pat Nixon, died last year.
Mr Nixon, now 81, left office in August 1974 ahead of expected impeachment
proceedings because of the Watergate scandals, becoming the only one of the
42 US presidents forced to resign. He was elected in 1968, narrowly beating
Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, and in a 1972 landslide over Senator George
McGovern.
He has spent much of the last 20 years seeking to recover from that
disgrace, writing several books, mostly on foreign policy, and speaking and
travelling extensively. He was in Moscow last month, but a planned meeting
with Mr Boris Yeltsin was cancelled after the Russian president expressed
annoyance that Mr Nixon had met opposition leaders.
There are five living US ex-presidents, an unusually high number. Mr George
Bush is living in Texas and Maine, keeping a mostly low profile, as is Mr
Ronald Reagan in California. Mr Gerald Ford spends much time playing golf.
Mr Jimmy Carter, the only Democrat among them, has remained active in public
life, through his domestic projects building low-income housing and his
international mediation.
