FT  27 JAN 94 / Plea over river pollution upheld


The National Rivers Authority yesterday won a High Court ruling that
companies can be found guilty of causing pollution through their operations,
even if the offence is the result of actions by employees who cannot be said
to be part of the 'controlling mind' of the organisation.
Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Morland allowed the authority's
appeal against a decision by magistrates at West Malling, Kent, in January
last year that Alfred McAlpine Homes East could not be held responsible for
polluting a stream and causing death to fish.
The construction company was prosecuted after wet cement was washed into the
Ditton stream at Goldwell Springs, East Malling, in May 1992.
The High Court ordered a rehearing before a fresh bench. McAlpine Homes was
refused leave to appeal to the Lords.
