FT  22 JUL 94 / Howard 'acted unconstitutionally'


Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was accused in the Lords of acting
unconstitutionally when he 'misused' a discretionary power enabling him to
set the starting date for a compensation scheme for victims of criminal
injuries.
Lord Simon of Glaisdale said that Mr Howard had chosen to interpret the
discretionary power as entitling him not to bring in the scheme at all, and
to substitute a non-statutory scheme.
Mr Howard had flown in the face of parliament's clear indication that it
wanted a statutory scheme, he said.
