FT  21 APR 94 / Speedy appeals on regulations urged


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Two Conservative MPs yesterday tabled an amendment to the de-regulation bill
that would allow companies speedy help in the courts if their businesses
were threatened by decisions of government regulators.
The amendment would allow companies to plead in magistrates courts in
England and Wales for a stay of execution if, for example, government
environment or health and safety inspectors interpreted regulations in a way
that imposed excessive costs on the business.
Mr Ian Smedley, responsible for de-regulation at the Institute of Directors,
said the amendment was 'a good test of whether the government is serious
about easing the regulatory burden on small businesses'.
Many companies complain not so much about government regulations as about
the way they are interpreted, he said.
The amendment would give companies, particularly small ones, an easier and
quicker way of resisting what can be unreasonable enforcement actions by
government regulators, he said.
The amendment to the bill, now in committee stage, has been put forward by
Mr John Sykes and Mr Nirj Deva. Mr Sykes claims support for the amendment
from up to 80 backbench Conservative MPs.
