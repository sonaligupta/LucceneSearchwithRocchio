FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: VW chief says Lopez made first
approach

MR JOSE Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, General Motors' former global purchasing
chief, first approached arch-rival Volkswagen before Christmas last year,
according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman.
'He got in touch with me. I did not try to woo him,' Mr Piech said yesterday
in an interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Lopez, currently at the centre of a storm over alleged industrial
espionage, eventually quit GM and joined VW in mid-March.
'We got to know each other and discovered we thought in similar ways,' Mr
Piech said.
Mr Lopez's move had nothing to do with money, Mr Piech said. 'He has less
income now than he had before.'
The timing and the nature of the contacts between the two men, around six
months after Mr Lopez was promoted to the top ranks of GM in the US, puts
paid to speculation that he was lured away by Mr Piech.
It suggests that Mr Lopez was planning his defection over an extended
period. He was followed by seven former colleagues, who are due to appear in
court in Frankfurt today to challenge a legal attempt by GM to prevent them
from continuing to work for VW for up to one year.
The court case is one of several launched by GM and Adam Opel, its German
subsidiary, based on their belief that Mr Lopez and his team took secret GM
documents with them when they left Detroit.
Mr Piech disclosed yesterday that VW had already successfully fought several
legal skirmishes with GM. 'We have four rounds behind us and VW has made no
mistakes.'
The VW chairman, who on Monday broke his recent silence with a statement
supporting Mr Lopez, said any possible legal charges would be answered in
court.
Mr Piech dismissed suggestions that VW's actions in hiring away Mr Lopez and
his seven colleagues from GM had caused widespread dismay in German
industry, and was at odds with the style of German business.
