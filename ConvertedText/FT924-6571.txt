FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: AMD to build chip plant in Texas


   By LOUISE KEHOE


ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, is to build a
Dollars 700m manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas.
The plant will employ up to 1,000 people and produce AMD's next generations
of microprocessors and highly integrated logic chips for applications, such
as computer networking and multi-media computing.
Scheduled for completion in 1994, it will initially be capable of producing
integrated circuits on eight-inch diameter silicon wafers using the latest
manufacturing technology to produce devices with half-micron features
(approximately 1/200th of the diameter of a strand of human hair) and
smaller.
Chips and Technologies, another Silicon Valley chip maker, said it was
restructuring to reduce expenses and increase its focus on key strategic
products. Chips has reduced its workforce by 20 per cent since June. The
company now expects a further reduction of about 20 per cent.
