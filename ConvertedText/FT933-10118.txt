FT  05 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets: Nafta talks weigh on Mexican equities


MEXICO, after an easier midession showing, finished on a brighter note as
investors awaited the start of talks in Washington on the North American
Free Trade Agreement. The market index registered a rise on the day of 27.67
at 1,804.72.
Helping to depress initial sentiment was an early fall in Telefonos de
Mexico, the telephone group, of 1 per cent, following a decline in its ADRs
in the US.
BRAZILIAN stocks advanced 2.5 per cent in early trading on bargain hunting
following falls in the last few days. But by the close the Bovespa index had
more than lost the rise and was down 1.1 per cent on balance at 61,820.
The market has been sensitive recently regarding talks between President
Itamar Franco and congress over wages policy. Trading is likely to remain
thin ahead of the options and futures market settlements later this month.
