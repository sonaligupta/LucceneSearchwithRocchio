FT  23 OCT 92 / Greece may soften its line on Macedonia


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


THE resignation from parliament of Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign
minister, has boosted the beleaguered Greek government's chances of
defeating its populist critics on the question of recognition for the
ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
Mr Samaras, whose hardline views on Macedonia are rejected by the prime
minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, stood down on Wednesday night after a
stormy meeting of the ruling New Democracy's parliamentary group.
The government's one-seat majority in the 300-member Parliament remains
safe, as another ND politician will fill the empty seat. There are no
provisions in Greece for holding by-elections.
Mr Samaras was sacked as foreign minister last April for advocating that
Greece should close the border with Macedonia unless the Skopje government
agreed to change the country's name.
Greece wants Macedonia to choose another name for international use, to
avoid implying a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name.
With Mr Samaras out of the way, the prime minister can try to win popular
support for his compromise on a double name for Macedonia.
However, the government would again be in serious danger if the European
Community reverses its decision last June not to recognise Macedonia under
its present name.
