FT  04 AUG 92 / House prices continue to fall


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


HOUSE prices are continuing to fall in many parts of the country, according
to separate surveys published yesterday by building societies.
The reports will further diminish hopes of a return of confidence in the
housing market, which might have heralded the start of a recovery in the
economy generally.
Nationwide, the UK's second-largest building society, said that prices on
average fell by 0.5 per cent last month after a similar fall in June. The
average price of a home last month was Pounds 55,414 - 6 per cent lower than
during the corresponding month last year.
Northern Rock building society, in a separate report, said that prices in
northern England fell by between 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent during the
three months to the end of July.
Mr John Hutchinson, a Nationwide director, said fears about unemployment and
the state of the general economy were preventing the market from recovering.
He said that the housing market had a central role to play in the recovery
of the UK economy. It was vital, therefore, that everybody involved should
search for practical initiatives to end the uncertainties that were
depressing the market.
