FT  15 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Aiming to ease conflict


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


Commercial disputes frequently drift into legal proceedings which can be
costly and wasteful in terms of management time and damaging to goodwill
between the people involved.
But there is another method of defusing conflict, known as alternative
dispute resolution.
Suggestions of how and when to use ADR are contained in a new guide* by Alex
Roney, legal adviser to the London Chamber of Commerce. ADR may not be
suitable in every case, particularly if there is a link between the dispute
and further claims, but it does offer the advantages of speed, privacy and a
reduction in the amount of acrimonious discussion, says Roney. If it does
not work the parties can then resort to conventional litigation.
Alternative dispute resolution may involve conciliation, in which a neutral
third party encourages the two sides to reach agreement or mediation, where
the third party plays a more interventionist role.
The two sides to the dispute can stage a mini-trial or executive tribunal
where both parties present their case before senior executives from the two
sides and a neutral 'expert'.
How do the costs of ADR compare with formal litigation? The guide compares
the costs involved in a disputed claim of Pounds 15,000 in a county court, a
Pounds 100,000 claim before the high court and a claim settled by ADR. The
costs involved in ADR will be broadly similar almost regardless of the
amount claimed, it says.
The costs involved in county court litigation would be between Pounds 5,000
and Pounds 7,500, in high court action between Pounds 8,000 and Pounds
15,000, and under ADR, assuming mediation takes one business day, between
Pounds 3,300 and Pounds 4,500, Roney calculates.
