FT  08 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China signs contract for 34 McDonnell
Douglas airliners


   By Our Foreigh Staff


China has signed a contract for 34 V2500-powered McDonnell Douglas MD-90
airliners. The engines are produced by International Aero Engines, of which
Rolls-Royce is a principal shareholder.
The deal, which was signed in Washington, represents an increase of 14
aircraft over the previously announced number and the value of new business
for Rolls-Royce is about Dollars 50m. The first MD-90 is scheduled for
delivery in early 1996. Half the aircraft will be manufactured in China with
US-supplied parts.
Mr Li Lan Oing, vice-premier of China and Mr Ron Brown, US commerce
secretary, both attended the contract signing. The V2500 order book now
stands at 1,525 engines worth more than Dollars 8.5bn.
The V2500 has been ordered on the Airbus A320 and A321 and the MD-90-30 as
well as being available for the A319 and MD-90-50. Airbus Industrie, the
European aircraft manufacturing consortium, has been taking steps to
strengthen its presence in the fast growing Chinese market and last week
announced the establishment of a flight crew training centre in Beijing.
V2500 engines are manufactured by Rolls-Royce in the UK and by Pratt &
Whitney in the US, the other principal shareholder. Other partners in
International Aero Engines are MTU and FiatAvio in Europe and JAEC in Japan.
The deal with China was signed last Friday and is worth a total of Dollars
1.6bn.
