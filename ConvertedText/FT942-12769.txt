FT  28 APR 94 / BCCI finances 'obscured'


   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent


An accounts officer with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International withheld from auditors details of guarantees given to cover
loans to a Middle Eastern businessman, the Old Bailey heard yesterday.
The actions of Mr Imran Imam made BCCI appear in better financial health
than it really was, Mr Antony Evans QC, prosecuting, told the jury.
Mr Imam denies six charges including conspiring to conceal documents,
furnishing false information and conspiring to falsify records.
Mr Evans said that between 1986 and 1990, loans totalling Dollars 105m were
made by the National Commercial Bank, ostensibly to Dr Ghaith Pharaon, a
wealthy Middle East entrepreneur.
BCCI handled the loans for Dr Pharaon and gave guarantees to the Saudi
National Commercial Bank to repay the full amount in case of any default.
However, Mr Imam did not tell auditors Price Waterhouse about these
guarantees despite knowing of of their existence, Mr Evans said.
Price Waterhouse was deceived and signed accounts which gave a false picture
of BCCI's profitability, he said.
The trial continues today.
The jury in the trial of Mr Nazmu Virani, the former head of Control
Securities, a property and leisure group, was sent out yesterday to consider
its verdict. It will resume its deliberations today.
Mr Virani denies 11 counts of furnishing false information, one of theft and
one of false accounting.
