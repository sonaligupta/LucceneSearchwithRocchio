FT  01 JUL 92 / Letter: The choices undermined by Sunday trading


   From Mr TIM MONTGOMERIE


Sir, Freedom of choice is quite properly a cornerstone of modern western
society, but classical liberals generally agree that our freedom must be
exercised within a conducive social framework. Adam Smith and Edmund Burke
deemed that framework to be one where there was a great deal of fellow
feeling or 'sympathy' for those around us with a particular stress on the
family, on the local and on intermediate institutions: Burke's 'small
platoons'.
In your advocacy of Sunday trading (leading article, June 26) you fail to
demonstrate any understanding that an extension of economic choice in this
area may undermine other choices.
Sunday is the day when families and friends can enjoy time together and it
is the day when elderly people receive most attention. It is the traditional
Sunday pause in the economy that allows space for vital social contact; to
examine the Sunday issue only in terms of individual choice neglects the
important family dimension. Many small, independent retailers may also be
forced into closure by big store competition and this could be very damaging
to some communities and especially pensioners and the less mobile who depend
on local outlets.
Given the relatively inelastic demand for most of the goods in question it
must also be highly doubtful as to the economic worth of Sunday trading.
Capital may be better used but labour costs will be higher. Any advantages
will go to the retailers who do open and win trade from six-day traders.
More and more traders will therefore be forced to open, causing an
escalation of costs - all in pursuit of a very limited amount of custom.
