FT  19 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Finland's DM1bn offering attracts
domestic investors


   By RICHARD WATERS


THE Republic of Finland yesterday took advantage of the rally in D-Mark
bonds to launch a DM1bn, 10-year issue as attention swung back to European
currencies.
Most international investors have been significantly underweight in D-Marks,
given the inflationary wage demands from public sector, engineering and
other unions and the strong monetary growth of recent months. Also, yield
spreads had widened, offering better opportunities than in recent weeks.
News that the wage dispute with German engineering workers may have reached
a conclusion set the stage for Finland, a double-A credit, to come to the
market. Its deal was priced to yield 28 basis points over the benchmark 8
1/4 per cent Bund due 2001 (some 33 basis points over the 10-year fund
issue). Demand was said to have been heavy from domestic investors, with
three quarters of the issue being placed in Germany.
The bonds were bid later in the day at 99.45, just above the price at which
they had been issued.
Parallel with the rally in D-Marks yesterday was a renewed surge in the Ecu,
which has recently been the victim of sagging confidence in the convergence
process of currencies within the ERM. Alcatel Alsthom, the French
telecommunications and engineering group, took advantage of this to come to
the bond market with its first issue, a Ecu150m, five-year issue priced to
yield around 9.2 per cent.
The Ecu market, starved of interest from large institutions, has witnessed a
constant flow of retail-targeted deals recently. As a result some said the
Alcatel deal was likely to take some time to place in full.
