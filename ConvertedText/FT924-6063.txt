   NEW YORK


THE New York district attorney yesterday announced the criminal indictment
of the city's newspaper deliverers' union on charges of defrauding leading
newspapers by running a multi-million dollar racket for the past 16 years,
writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The indictment alleges the union, in co-operation with members of organised
crime, took part in a corrupt newspaper delivery racket which engaged in
bribery, theft, threats, beatings and sabotage.
