FT  29 APR 94 / Wind farms win public support


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent


A survey of people living near three wind farms in Wales has found that
nearly three-quarters would be prepared to see further development.
No fewer than 68 per cent of those interviewed said the wind farms had had
little impact on their area - in spite of the turbines being visible for up
to 15km (nine miles).
The survey was commissioned by the Countryside Council for Wales as part of
its evidence to an inquiry being held by the Commons Welsh affairs
committee. A total of 457 people were interviewed.
The positive attitudes to wind farms come as planning objections to them
have been increasing. Most interviewees felt the farms were neither
intrusive nor noisy, and at least half thought they were in keeping with the
countryside. Most hostility to wind farms was found among a 'control' sample
near Brecon, Powys, where there are none.
The survey included the National Wind Power site at Llandinam in Powys,
which is the largest in Wales with 103 turbines. The other two sites were at
Rhyd-y-Groes on Anglesey, and Llangwyryfon near Aberystwyth.
