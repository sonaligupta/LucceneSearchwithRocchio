FT  20 APR 94 / Compensation for bogus food claims


Most food companies sent compensation to researchers who sent bogus letters
of complaint.
Researchers at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology wrote false letters of complaint to 233 companies and 83 per cent
replied with postal orders, cheques or goods.
Dr Vince Mitchell said: 'As the recession continues more and more people are
exploiting companies and their desire for good customer relations. Some
companies estimate they are sent hundreds of fraudulent claims every year.'
The main targets for false claims were sweet and chocolate bar manufacturers
such as Mars, Cadbury and Rowntree MacIntosh.
Each company was sent a vague letter of dissatisfaction which did not state
the date or location of the purchase but most wrote back and sent
compensation equal to the cost of the alleged goods.
