FT  05 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP surges


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Interest soared in British Petroleum after much better than expected
third-quarter figures, and the shares climbed 9 1/2 to a two-year high of
356 1/2 p.
Activity expanded rapidly to 25m shares traded, making BP the market's top
turnover stock of the day. Most analysts moved swiftly to upgrade their
forecasts after the figures were released.
Some notes of caution were struck in the generally enthusiastic reception,
with one analyst suggesting that the fourth-quarter figures were unlikely to
be as exciting.
A spot of US selling was also seen as those transatlantic investors who have
been supporting the stock recently saw an ideal chance to bail out with a
profit. UK institutions were reported to be more than keen to mop up the
outflow from the US sellers as they rushed to remedy underweight positions
in the stock.
One cautious stance came from Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull, who said
the brokerage firm would retain its overvalued rating on BP in spite of the
figures, arguing that the share price had pushed past a reasonable level.
The gloss from BP rubbed off on some other oil stocks. Shell Transport,
which reports third-quarter figures next Thursday, rose 8 1/2 to 723 1/2 p
in healthy volume of 7.3m. Enterprise Oil, in which 10m shares were traded -
the bulk of which came through three block placings totalling 8.8m at 476
1/2 p - firmed 3 to 479p.
