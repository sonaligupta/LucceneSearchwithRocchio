FT  05 AUG 93 / Computer war claims victim


   By PAUL TAYLOR


KAYTECH, one of the UK's largest independent computer retail chains, has
ceased trading and a creditors' meeting has been called for later this month
to vote on liquidation.
The Bromley-based group, run by Mr Tomas Kaczer, has stores in Southampton
and Manchester, and opened a computer 'superstore' in DH Evans in London's
Oxford Street in February.
Yesterday there was no reply from Kaytech's headquarters. Kaytech's
operations in DH Evans were closed. Callers were referred to a firm of
insolvency practitioners which confirmed that the group was no longer
trading and that a creditors' meeting had been called for August 20.
Kaytech is the latest casualty of the upheaval in personal computer
manufacturing and retailing markets.
Over the past six months a handful of small PC 'clone' manufacturers have
failed. This has prompted renewed predictions of a wave of consolidation
sweeping the industry.
Meanwhile independent PC retailers such as Kaytech have faced growing
competition. Most PC manufacturers have set up their own telephone-based
direct sales operations, while competition from high street stores and the
new breed of PC 'superstores' is growing.
Earlier this year Dixons acquired four 'PC World' superstores from Vision
Technology Group for Pounds 8.5m. Specialist Computer Holdings, another
independent computer sales group, announced plans earlier this week for a
nationwide chain of computer superstores.
SCS, a privately owned Birmingham-based group, said it plans to invest about
Pounds 40m over the next two years on a string of outlets.
