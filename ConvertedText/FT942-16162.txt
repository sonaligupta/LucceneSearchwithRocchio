FT  12 APR 94 / People: Koerfer to chair Sutherland


Sutherland & Partners, the small Edinburgh stockbroking house which says it
is the only institutional broker headquartered in Scotland, has appointed a
Swiss as its chairman. He is Patrick Koerfer, a London-based director of the
Swiss fund manager Global Asset Management.
'We could have done what other companies here do and appoint a Scottish
dignitary,' says Ken Brown, the managing director, 'but we felt that with
our international orientation Patrick Koerfer would be more valuable to us.'
Sutherland was founded in late 1989 to provide international soft commission
services to UK clients and independent research to international clients.
That formula was only partially successful and in 1991 Roderick Sutherland,
the founder, resigned as ceo. He ceased to be non-executive chairman last
February, since when there has been no chairman.
Since 1992 Sutherland & Partners, which employs 25 people, has concentrated
on execution-only dealing, traditional advisory stockbroking and
research-based broking in the whisky, retail and pharmaceutical sectors. Its
institutional clients are in continental Europe and the US as well as the
UK.
Brown says the company is based in Scotland 'because that is where we all
want to live'. The fact that Edinburgh is not a major stockbroking centre
offers complete discretion compared with London, he says. 'There is none of
the tittle-tattle you get in London. You can do a deal here without people
getting wind of it.'
Koerfer, who is in his 50s, will bring to the company his ability to
introduce Sutherland to European clients and will accompany Sutherland
executives on forays on the continent.
