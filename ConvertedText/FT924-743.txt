FT  22 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Nomura takes punitive action


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


NOMURA Securities, Japan's largest stock broker, announced punitive measures
for its top executives over the company's questionable sales of asset-backed
securities to retail investors.
Mr Hideo Sakamaki, president, will receive a 20 per cent salary cut, and Mr
Tadashi Takubo, senior managing director, faces a 10 per cent pay cut, both
effective for one year. Mr Atsushi Saito, who headed the international sales
unit, was demoted from senior managing director to managing director.
Nomura said it received a written warning from the ministry of finance last
week, for breaching industry regulations, which require brokers to warn
investors of risks involved in investment products.
Nomura last month admitted it had failed to warn retail investors, when
selling its US real estate-backed bonds. The broker has compensated Y23bn
(Dollars 185m) to more than 10,000 clients who had incurred losses on the
securities.
