FT  30 OCT 93 / Property: For those with reform in mind - Cadogan's Place


   By GERALD CADOGAN


THE NEW rules allowing owners of leasehold flats to buy the freehold come
into effect on Monday. Copies of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993 can be obtained from Her Majesty's Stationery Office
for Pounds 19.65. But leaseholders still face many hurdles if they intend to
act and will need solicitors and surveyors.
Several firms and the department of the environment have prepared (or are
putting together) books and pamphlets with advice. In alphabetical order,
these include Bircham (071-222-8044) with Strutt & Parker (071-235-9959);
William H. Brown (071-636-2736) with Philip Hodges (071-454-9970); Francis
Russell (071-225-3344); Macfarlanes (071-831-9922) with Property Vision
(071-602-8788); Simmons & Simmons (071- 628-2020). There might be a charge
for some but the DoE's is free (PO Box 151, London E15 2HF). Meanwhile, law
firm Trowers & Hamlins (071-831-6292), in conjunction with Fineman Lever, is
organising a free seminar in London on November 18.
Guides to the legislation include:
How to Manage Your Own Block of Flats, by John Cumming and Richard Hickie;
and How to Buy Your Freehold or Extend Your Lease, by Paul Gurowich, David
Marcus and David Haines (both published by the College of Estate Management,
Whiteknights, Reading RG6 2AW, at Pounds 14.50 and Pounds 12 respectively).
Buying Your Freehold or Extending Your Lease, by Timothy Curran (Pounds
11.99 from Leasehold Enfranchisement Ltd, Swan Centre, Fishers Lane,
Chiswick, London W4 1RX).
IN MAYFAIR, central London, Egerton (071-493-0676) is selling 3 Lees Place
W1, just off Grosvenor Square, on a lease with 26 years to run and with a
guide price of Pounds 1.15m. But as the ground rent was fixed in 1931 at
Pounds 125 for the whole term, the house is can be enfranchised under the
new laws. Many larger houses in London cannot because the ground rent is too
high or a company (not an individual) is the leaseholder.

SIR EDWARD Heath, the former prime minister, is the only person to have
enfranchised in the close of Salisbury Cathedral. But whoever buys Myles
Place, a very grand Grade I-listed house in the close which the dean and
chapter are offering on a new 60-year lease, will not be able to join him
because the ground rent of Pounds 500 exceeds the low rent test of Pounds
250 for a lease outside London granted after March 31 1990. The agent is DW
Barke (0722-327087) and the price around Pounds 650,000.

ARDELEY BURY is a romantic castle on an ancient moated site near Stevenage
in Hertfordshire. Its Tudor brick front, with a handsome, low, vaulted
entrance hall merges delightfully with Georgian Gothic brick and flint
towers and turrets, and a great hall built on to the Tudor house. As you
approach, you pass a lake with a Tudor boathouse; ancient parkland with
bumps and hollows awaiting an an archaeological dig (if that appeals); and
old, thatched barns in apple-pie order.
This is a small paradise, where, even in winter, no neighbour is in sight.
In excellent repair, it is waiting for new owners who will enjoy living in
an exotic and congenial house. But they will need to bring large pieces of
furniture with them. The guide price from Savills (071-499 8644) is Pounds
2.5m, which includes 90 acres. It is hard to believe that such rural bliss
exists an hour from London.
BLISS MILL, on the edge of Chipping Norton, is a Cotswolds landmark - a
huge, Italian renaissance-style tweed mill, with a chimney like a minaret,
that would be more at home in Bradford or Glasgow than Oxfordshire. Built in
1872, it worked until 1980 as one of the last survivors of the Cotswold wool
industry.
When it closed, a speculator bought it. There were various planning
applications, including for a mosque. In 1987, Bliss Mill Holdings started
converting it into flats, but went into receivership in 1990; the asking
prices were too high. It was acquired by Widworthy Leisure Ltd, which took
it to market last year - and then also went into receivership. Now, Chris
Barlow, of Coopers & Lybrand (as receiver), is marketing the flats at prices
from Pounds 85,000 to Pounds 198,000, and several have been sold already or
are under offer. The agent is Savills in Banbury (0295-263535).
