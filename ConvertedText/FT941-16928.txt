FT  07 JAN 94 / Crackdown over trade returns


The government is to crack down on companies trading in the European single
market which fail to file monthly statistical returns.
Customs and Excise said yesterday that it planned to take 'firm action'. It
can fine companies up to Pounds 2,500 for not filing monthly Intrastat
returns, which are used to compile trade statistics across the EU following
abolition of border controls.
Companies conducting trade valued at more than Pounds 135,000 were required
to file returns during any month during which the trade took place.
