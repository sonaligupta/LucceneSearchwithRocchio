FT  06 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU acts against residues in tea

The European Union has set a time-table for all tea-producing countries to
reduce pesticide residues in processed tea to acceptable levels if they want
to retain access to the EU market. According to Indian tea industry
officials, the EU is requiring reductions in three two-yearly stages
beginning this month.
The Indian industry, which exports over 200m kg of tea a year, thinks the
problem can be tackled largely by scrupulously following the spraying
schedules laid down by the Tea Research Association and the United Planters'
Association.
The Indian Tea Board has started consultation with the producers, exporters
and research organisations to formulate a strategy gradually to reduce the
levels of pesticide residues in teas grown in different parts of the country
without disturbing the volume of production.
Japan has recently expressed concern about the rising level of pesticide
residues in Darjeeling teas and has rejected some shipments. Some German tea
buyers have also complained about pesticide residues in Indian teas.
