FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cott steps up own-brand drive

Cott Corporation, the fast-growing maker of private-label soft drinks, has
set up a venture to help North American and European supermarkets expand
their range of retailer-controlled products.
The new company, which has yet to be named, is a joint venture between Cott
and Mr David Nichol, formerly a senior executive at Loblaws, Canada's
biggest grocery chain.
The first products - likely to include ice creams, fruit juices and snack
foods - will be available next spring.
Mr Nichol spearheaded a successful retailer-brand programme at Loblaws, and
has carved out a reputation as one of North America's most outspoken
champions of retailer-controlled products in the assault on national brands.
He recently helped J. Sainsbury, the UK supermarket group, launch Cott-made
soft drinks under the Sainsbury's Classic label.
The low-priced Sainsbury brand garnered a market share of almost 75 per cent
in its first nine weeks on the shelves, while Coca-Cola's share of Sainsbury
sales fell to 9 per cent from 44 per cent.
However, the investment community has given Cott's diversification plans a
lukewarm response. Cott shares have tumbled by about 13 per cent on the
Toronto Stock Exchange in the past two days, to CDollars 16.62 at
mid-morning yesterday.
Mr Nichol said yesterday the venture's customers would be mainly North
American retailers expanding their private-label portfolios but lacking the
experience in this sort of development. He said several European retailers
had asked for help in broadening private-label ranges.
