FT  23 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gas rises on MMC optimism


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE


A MEETING with the official gas regulator caught the imagination of several
oil analysts yesterday and led to a sharp rise in British Gas shares.
Several analysts decided that Sir James Mackinnon, the Ofgas regulator, was
taking a more conciliatory view on the company's place within the industry.
Nevertheless, Mr Nick Antill of company broker Hoare Govett said that how
ever placatory Sir James might have appeared, future rulings were now out of
his hands and under the auspices of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
That more cautious attitude to the meeting prompted profit-taking at the
upper levels, and after being 9 higher at one stage the shares were taken
back to close 7 1/2 up at 311p on heavy turnover of 13m.
There were also suggestions that agency broker James Capel had issued a buy
recommendation on Gas. The house denied the rumour but said that it was
bullish on the meeting.
