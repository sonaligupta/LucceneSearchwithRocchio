AMERICAN consumers have begun the New Year in a more cautious vein,
according to the latest retail sales figures published by the Commerce
Department.
In February, total sales rose by a modest 0.3 per cent compared with the
previous month.
The department also revised downwards its original estimates for January,
from an improvement of 0.3 per cent to no change from December, when sales
had jumped by 1.1 per cent.
Last month, durable goods sales fell by 0.5 per cent, largely because of
weak demand for cars and light trucks, purchases of which fell by 2.2 per
cent to an annual rate of 12.6m units.
Non-durable sales went up in February by 0.7 per cent, led by strong
performances at grocery stores and petrol stations. Department stores sales
generally held on to their Christmas gains.
