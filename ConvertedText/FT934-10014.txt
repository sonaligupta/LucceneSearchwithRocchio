FT  08 NOV 93 / People: Wellman


Alan Baxter, who was chief executive at Scholes Group until earlier this
autumn, has been named chief executive of Wellman, the specialist engineer,
with immediate effect.
Baxter, aged 43, will be hoping for better luck at Wellman than at Scholes,
a much larger group which he ran for little more than a year. Its executive
chairman, Bill Riches, said in September that 'it just didn't work out'.
Yesterday Wellman said it was ready to embark on a new stage of development,
and Baxter had the qualities and experience to take it forward. He replaces
John Gilbert, who has successfully steered Wellman through the recession and
carried out a difficult restructuring.
West-Midlands based Wellman had turnover of Pounds 23.7m in the year ended
March, while Scholes, which makes electrical installation materials,
reported turnover of Pounds 62.7m for the year to June.
