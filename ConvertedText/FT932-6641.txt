FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: RPC 4.3 times oversubscribed


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


Investors seeking a stake in RPC, the rigid plastic packaging company, have
subscribed for more than 11 times the number of shares on offer.
When the offer closed on Tuesday, the intermediaries offer was 11.06 times
subscribed. That means Pounds 128m of cash was chasing Pounds 11.6m of
shares, one of the highest levels of oversubscription in recent
intermediaries offers.
On May 18 Cazenove placed 18.2m shares with institutions, representing 65
per cent of the issue. The total issue was therefore 4.3 times subscribed.
