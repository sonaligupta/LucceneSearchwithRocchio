FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cool summer hits Japanese store


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


ISETAN, a leading Japanese department store, saw sharp falls in interim
sales and earnings due to continued weak consumer confidence and the
unusually cool summer, writes Emiko Terazono.
The company reported a 51.9 per cent plunge in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits for the first half to September to Y654m (Dollars 6m) on a 5.9 per
cent fall in sales to Y200.5bn. After-tax profits fell Y56.3 per cent to
Y227m. Profits at large retailers have suffered as Japanese consumers are
opting for cheaper goods available at discount retailers. All of Isetan's
sales divisions saw falls in revenue. Sales of clothing, Isetan's mainstay,
suffered a 6.8 per cent fall to Y92.1bn, while household goods sales
declined 6.3 per cent to Y15.8bn.
For the full year to March, Isetan expects a 30.4 per cent fall in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y3.5bn on a 5.1 per cent drop in sales
to Y420bn. After-tax profits are projected to fall 51.9 per cent to Y1.7bn.
