FT  25 MAR 92 / Appointments: Clarke fills first chair in corporate
governance


Corporate governance, recently the bane of the British boardroom, has now
been elevated to the role of an academic discipline.
Leeds Polytechnic will offer the first chair in corporate governance, with
half the cost to be sponsored by Drake Beam Morin, an executive outplacement
consultancy.
The chair will be filled by Thomas Clarke (right), previously a senior
lecturer at Nottingham Business School, lecturer at St Andrews University
and a visiting professor at FGV Business School, Sao Paulo.
Clarke's doctorate focuses on control in several industries, including the
British newspaper industry. In 1975, he first met the late Robert Maxwell at
the Scottish Daily News in Glasgow and completed a detailed study of his
business practices.
This work is only now being published because of threat of litigation.
Clarke's role during his three-year appointment will, among other things,
involve studying the pressures of short-termism on corporate decision-making
and 'inquire into the competencies of directors'.
And why is an outplacement firm interested in promoting the study of such
things? 'We're interested in good management generally,' a spokeswoman
explains.
