Survey of Unit Trusts


   By BARBARA ELLIS


UNIT TRUST Peps acted as the Seventh Cavalry of the investment scene earlier
this year. But it was the unit trust groups selling Peps who were being
rescued, rather than investors, whose experience since 1987 has sometimes
had the feel of a financial scalping.
With marketing parties likely to muster soon for another onslaught, once the
1987 crash drops out of the five-year performance statistics, recent history
can provide some useful perspective for anyone with cash to allocate.
Packaging them as tax-free Peps has lately been almost the only way to
persuade investors to buy unit trusts. Helped by pre-election scares about
the possible removal of tax breaks, Peps accounted for 84 per cent and 75
per cent of total net unit trust sales during the first and second quarters
of 1992 respectively. Net sales of unit trust Peps hit a record Pounds 336m
in the three months to June - double the figure for the second quarter of
1991.
This was described by Philip Warland, director general of the Unit Trust
Association (UTA), as 'a remarkable achievement in a personal savings market
which saw outflows from building societies and the great attraction of
National Savings.'
He could just as well have saluted the degree of investor blindness induced
by the idea of freedom from tax.
'Tax-free dividends are seen as being of paramount importance in the
decision to take out a Pep,' said Save & Prosper, reporting last year on a
survey which sampled at random 2,000 of its then 55,000 Pep-holders. The
survey, still the most comprehensive available, found that 77 per cent of
Pep investors ranked tax-free dividends as very important. The 'ability to
produce better returns than a building society' got second rating with 66
per cent, followed by freedom from capital gains tax with 62 per cent.
An astonishing 52 per cent of S&P Pep-holders said they had bought the plan
with nothing particular in mind, against 35 per cent who intended the Pep
proceeds for either a lump sum or regular income on retirement.
The unit trust Pep investors were predominantly men (65 per cent) with an
average age of 52, married (74 per cent) and in full-time employment (52 per
cent).
About seven in 10 were standard 25 per cent rate taxpayers, despite the fact
that the tax advantages of Pep are greater for people on the 40 per cent
rate.
However, as it turned out, tax was one of the least of worries for many Pep
investors. Few of them saw a capital gain during the period since Peps were
introduced in 1987; and, because of Peps' tax-free status, losses could not
be offset against any gains elsewhere nor carried forward.
S&P's best-performing unit trust Pep available since January 1987 was
Scotshares, which showed a 52 per cent gain up to mid-September, including
gross income reinvested. But since the original investment limit was Pounds
420, this meant that the actual gain could have been just Pounds 219.
At the other end of the scale, the S&P UK Smaller Companies Growth unit
trust Pep, launched in August 1987, had reduced Pounds 420 to Pounds 320 by
mid-September 1992, a 24 per cent loss. Larger losses have been possible
since the increases in investment limits. For instance, Pounds 3,000
invested in S&P's European Smaller Companies Pep at the beginning of 1990
was worth just Pounds 2,113 by September 14 this year - 30 per cent less. On
the same offer-to-bid basis, allowing for the cost of cashing in the Pep,
Pounds 6,000 invested at the beginning of July 1992 in S&P's UK Growth of
Capital Portfolio Pep was worth about 9 per cent less in mid-September.
Hopes of returns better than building societies could deliver were generally
dashed, as revealed by statistics from Micropal, covering the five years
from September 1, 1987. None of the 91 unit trust Peps covered managed to
equal the Pounds 61 earned risk-free on Pounds 100 in a building society
account. The closest would have been Newton Income, with a return of just
over Pounds 57. But, as Newton's Jonathan Powell explained, the Newton
Income unit trust was not available in Pep form until 1989.
the Newton Income Pep since then, compared with an estimated overall total
for Pep-holders of between 200,000 and 250,000. Figures are vague, as some
members of the UTA count each year's Peps separately, while others
consolidate Peps held by individual investors. Total Peps number somewhere
over a million.
So far the UTA has no precise details of where Pep money is going, though
informal soundings suggest high-income unit trusts as the logical
destination.
