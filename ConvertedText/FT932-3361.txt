FT  15 JUN 93 / Mongolian bank trial starts


   By REUTER


   ULAN BATOR


Two ex-governors of Mongolia's central bank and three other bankers were put
on trial yesterday on charges they virtually wiped out the country's foreign
exchange reserves by losing Dollars 82m on ill-advised deals, Reuter reports
from Ulan Bator.
Mr Gochoogiyn Khuderchuluun and Mr Naidansurengiyn Zhargalsaikhan, his
successor, are charged with dereliction of duty and abuse of position after
a series of foreign exchange deals in 1990-91.
'Astonishing and unbelievable,' diplomats quoted a banker as saying after
seeing the traders' books. 'A guidebook of classic mistakes in forex
dealing.'
