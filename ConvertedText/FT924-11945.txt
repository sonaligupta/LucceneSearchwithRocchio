FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Disposal benefits behind 13% advance to
Pounds 4.7m at Ferguson


   By PETER PEARSE


THE DISPOSAL of its loss-making businesses enabled Ferguson International
Holdings, the labels, hangers, communications components and printing and
publishing company, to report a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 4.7m in the six months to August 31.
Mr Michael Saint, managing director, said: 'We took the medicine last year.'
In the 12 months to February 29 1992 pre-tax profits tumbled 43 per cent to
Pounds 6.63m.
Turnover of continuing activities - at Pounds 61.8m - grew by Pounds 4.7m,
almost the same as the contribution from discontinued activities last time.
The company sold SBF of Philadelphia and Wirewares and Harkwell Cartons of
the UK. It also closed Harkwell Labels & Tags.
Trading profits on continuing businesses rose to Pounds 5.15m (Pounds 4.95m)
 -discontinued activities incurred losses of Pounds 233,000 last time. The
pre-tax line was further helped by a Pounds 100,000 reduction in interest
payable to Pounds 450,000, as borrowings were reduced from about Pounds 10m
to Pounds 6.64m.
Mr Saint said that 67 per cent of trading profits derived from the UK, 21
per cent from the US and 12 per cent from Europe, though the group was
seeking to lessen its dependence on the UK, he added.
The labels division, which makes textile labels for garments and non-textile
labels for food products, lifted trading profits to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds
2.23m) on turnover up at Pounds 28m (Pounds 23.3m), helped by the
acquisition of Globus Druck of Germany.
Hangers suffered from a fall-off in demand in Germany and the Netherlands,
where the division has a 60 per cent market share. This led to a 3 per cent
reduction in turnover to Pounds 15.6m. Trading profits fell to Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 1.49m).
Profits of the communications components side, the US cable TV parts
supplier described by Mr Saint as a cash generator to buy tooling and
machines for the other divisions, declined to Pounds 718,000 (Pounds
920,000) hit by competitive pressure on margins and unfavourable exchange
rates. Turnover rose at Pounds 8.93m (Pounds 8.27m) mostly because of the
acquisition of Interstate Cable Enterprises.
Printing and publishing lifted profits to Pounds 372,000 (Pounds 312,000) on
lower turnover of Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.5m).
Earnings rose 1p to 9.3p per share and the interim dividend is unchanged at
4.25p.
