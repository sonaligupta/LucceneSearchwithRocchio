FT  30 MAR 92 / Victory for reformists in Romania


   By VIRGINIA MARSH


   BUCHAREST


THE REFORMIST wing within Romania's ruling party, the National Salvation
Front (NSF), won an important political victory this weekend with the
re-election of Mr Petre Roman as party leader.
Nearly two-thirds of delegates meeting in Bucharest for the party's annual
convention voted in favour of Mr Roman and adopted his motion: 'The future -
today.' The document, which espouses a western European-style social
democracy, will form the basis of the party's political platform.
Addressing the delegates, Mr Roman said: 'Today the party won because we
showed we had a clear political line. This can lead us to victory in the
election.'
His supporters expressed relief that 'neo-Communists' no longer dominated
the party.
Mr Roman's re-election follows several weeks of open dispute in the NSF
between his supporters and those favouring Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's
president. President Iliescu, one of the party's founders, is associated
with the NSF's more reactionary faction.
