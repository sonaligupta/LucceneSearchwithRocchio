FT  01 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's trusts


While the gaggle of Lloyd's insurance funds look likely to gain investment
trust status, they have little in common with conventional trusts. The net
asset value of Lloyd's trusts' bond and equity holdings will be easily
measured. But the real balance of risks and rewards lies with underwriting
exposures at Lloyd's. Profits and losses from underwriting can not be
quantified until the 1994 underwriting year closes, in three years' time
under Lloyd's accounting rules. Without a secondary market in syndicate
participations, these exposures can not be easily valued in the meantime.
Lloyd's trusts should thus perform like insurance companies, trading at a
premium or discount to the value of their underlying investment portfolio,
depending on the underwriting outlook. How investors are expected to judge
the climate at Lloyd's is a complicated issue. Composite insurers are
already vulnerable to hurricanes and earthquakes, but Lloyd's syndicates
carry a far higher gearing to such unpredictable catastrophes. Claims
arising in obscure US courtrooms can have equally damaging effects.
That argues for a strict disclosure regime to ensure equal access to
information. Individual names at Lloyd's receive quarterly reports,
including claims figures relating to the syndicates in which they
participate. Stock market investors have a right to expect equal treatment,
not to mention stock exchange announcements when the Lutine bell tolls.
