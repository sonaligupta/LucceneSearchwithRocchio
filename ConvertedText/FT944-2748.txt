FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Porsche sets up launch finance


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


Porsche, the loss-making luxury sports car maker, has set up a five-year
DM300m (Dollars 191m) credit line to fund the launch of what Mr Wendelin
Wiedeking, chairman, described yesterday as the biggest product offensive in
the company's history.
The financing for new models - due in 1996 and 1997 and including the
lower-priced Boxster aimed at younger buyers - was arranged by Dresdner
Bank's Luxembourg subsidiary and J. P. Morgan, the company said.
Confirming a sharp reduction in losses to DM150m from DM239m for the year to
the end of July, Mr Wiedeking said the business was still on course to break
even in the current year. Overall sales were ahead of budget, he claimed.
However, he said car sales in the home market and France were tending to
weaken, and complained that the introduction in Germany of a 7.5 per cent
income tax surcharge next month was unlikely to encourage consumer spending.
Germany accounts for more than a third of Porsche marque sales, and is also
the most important market for the Mercedes-Benz E500, which it builds on
contract, and a souped-up joint-venture estate car, the Audi-Porsche Avant
RS2.
Porsche has close links with the VW group, owner of Audi, through Mr
Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, who owns 10 per cent of Porsche.
Mr Piech yesterday repeated his appeals for the German government to pay a
scrapping premium for old cars to encourage new sales. He told VW workers
that a lasting revival was not yet in sight in the domestic market.
However, worldwide group deliveries to customers had increased 7.4 per cent
in the first 11 months with most growth in the US and Asia, he said.
