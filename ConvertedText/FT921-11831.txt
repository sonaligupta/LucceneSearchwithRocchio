FT  30 JAN 92 / Commission challenges film grants


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


GERMAN AID for the film industry discriminates against foreign film-makers,
according to the European Commission, which has given the German government
a month to answer its complaints against the subsidy programme.
Directors of films which receive government grants have to be German or
'from a German cultural background'. The same conditions apply to some of
the jobs on co-productions between German and foreign film-makers.
The Commission approved the German aid scheme six years ago, but warned the
government it would have to remove the nationality restrictions by the end
of 1992.
But Bonn has just proposed extending the programme (including the
restrictions) for a further six years.
Brussels has asked Bonn to lower the level of aid available on applied
research contracts granted to companies in the five new La'nder (states) in
what was east Germany.
It says the maximum subsidy level of 50 per cent for each contract is too
high. European Commission guidelines recommend a 25 per cent aid ceiling for
applied research.
