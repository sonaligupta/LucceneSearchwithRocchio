FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: US food distributors revise
terms of merger


   By NIKKI TAIT


   TWO of the largest wholesale food distributors in the US


Super Valu and Wetterau - yesterday agreed to revise the terms of their
proposed Dollars 1bn-plus merger.
Under the outline deal announced last month, Super Valu would have made a
cash offer of Dollars 30.20 for each Wetterau share, valuing the common
stock at Dollars 643.3m. It would also have taken on Dollars 440m of
outstanding Wetterau debt.
Ahead of this transaction, however, Missouri-based Wetterau would have
'demerged' its retail subsidiary, called Shop 'n Save. This would have meant
a free distribution of shares in the business to existing Wetterau
stockholders.
However, after further negotiations and a Wetterau board meeting yesterday
afternoon, the two companies said they had agreed revised terms. Under the
new deal, Super Valu would pay Dollars 30.25 a share in cash, but no
demerger of the Shop 'n Save subsidiary would take place. Approval from
shareholders and certain regulatory consents are still needed.
Earlier in the day, fears that the deal would be called off caused Wetterau
shares, which were briefly suspended, to plunge sharply. By the close in New
York - before terms of the revised deal were known - the shares were down
Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 26.
Wetterau, quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market, currently ranks as
the national third-largest grocery wholesaler, while Super Valu has the
number two spot. Together, the combined operations would outstrip
Oklahoma-based Fleming Companies as the nation's largest wholesale food
distributor.
Separately, Super Valu announced first-quarter profits for the three months
to June 20 totalling Dollars 45.6m after-tax. This represented a sharp
improvement on the Dollars 31.6m seen in the same period a year earlier.
