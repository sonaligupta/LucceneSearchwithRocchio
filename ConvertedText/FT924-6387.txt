FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: A clear lead from government that would help rural
areas


   From Mr R H M SYMONS


Sir, With reference to the letter from David Grayson, of Business in the
Community (November 17), City Challenge has indeed given a new opportunity
to the inner cities through harnessing individual and specific networks that
exist in these areas.
Rural areas also have severe problems, causing, among other things, the
drift of the young to the urban areas. Villages have suffered from poorly
planned development, an increase in numbers of commuters and retired
residents, and a decline in agricultural employment. These changes threaten
the way of life and structure of the countryside.
In Dorset, we are particularly aware of these problems as they are
exacerbated by cutbacks in defence expenditure. We are already working in
partnership with the local authorities and the Rural Development Commission
on initiatives to help rural Dorset.
We believe that where the City Challenge, with a clear central lead from
government, has helped urban areas, a similar lead should be given to a
Rural Challenge.
We are already developing this idea with our colleagues from the Rural
Development Commission in order to present a model programme for government
consideration, and we are encouraged by the extent of the interest.
