FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC plans quotas on Chinese footwear
imports


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


MOST European Community states yesterday decided in principle to impose
quotas on imports of Chinese footwear.
Trade experts have yet to iron out technical problems - including the thorny
question of whether to apply the quota to the lucrative market for training
shoes.
Big manufacturers, including Nike and Reebok, obtain a growing share of
their production from factories in China and have been fighting the measure,
which they say would increase costs, and possibly prices.
Trainers were included in the quota plan, even though there is no Community
production of so-called 'hi-tech' sports shoes, and therefore no political
need to protect EC manufacturers.
The footwear quota proposal is an important trade precedent which should be
followed by the harmonisation or abolition of national quotas on other
imports from China, Vietnam and North Korea - nations defined by the EC as
'state trading countries'.
At the moment, a patchwork of national measures exists in many import areas,
including bicycles, umbrellas and toys. The Commission argues that national
quotas are already inefficient and will be impossible to enforce once
internal EC frontiers are removed at the end of this year.
In the case of footwear, Brussels decided to harmonise rather than abolish
most national quotas, because many member states were worried about the
impact of Chinese imports on the EC footwear industry.
At yesterday's meeting, only Britain held out against a quota, although the
Dutch, Germans and Danes are understood to have technical objections.
Portugal and Spain, on the other hand, are pressing for more categories of
shoes to be included.
