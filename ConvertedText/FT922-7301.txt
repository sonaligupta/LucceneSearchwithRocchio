FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gould sees need for closer EC
defence ties


   By IVO DAWNAY


BRITAIN should back greater European Community co-ordination of foreign and
defence policies and ally with France to press Germany to reflate, according
to Mr Bryan Gould, now contesting the Labour leadership with Mr John Smith,
Ivo Dawnay writes.
Speaking out in the week of the Commons debate on the Maastricht treaty
changes, the shadow environment secretary is clearly determined to stamp on
repeated charges by his rivals that he is on the Euro-sceptic wing of the
party.
He goes on to add, in an article in today's Guardian, that Labour has
succumbed too often to the 'temptation' to be reactive on EC issues by
supporting the Brussels majority wherever their views clash with the
Conservatives.
As an alternative to 'unthinking support' for the predominating community
view, he says Labour needs a distinctive and constructive voice, calling for
stronger local and regional power and allocating responsibility at the most
appropriate level.
Differing from the Labour leadership's official position, he argues that at
a supranational level there should be greater EC co-ordination of defence
and foreign affairs. He also advocates a common energy policy and a level
playing field in each country's management of multi-national companies.
