FT  29 JAN 92 / Appointments: New post at Laporte


David Wilbraham has been appointed to the new post of chief operating
officer at LAPORTE, the UK chemicals group. Ken Minton, chief executive,
decided last year to create the job in an effort to separate strategic
development from day-to-day operations.
Wilbraham, 52 and currently general manager of the chemical products group
of ICI's chemical and polymers division, has experience in both the
technical and commercial aspects of the chemical industry. An earlier post
as vice-president of ICI speciality chemicals in north America should also
help him at Laporte. About a third of the company's turnover is in the US.
Wilbraham, who will be based in the UK, will have responsibility for all
divisions at Laporte and will become chairman of each division. The
divisions' chief executives will report directly to him; he will report to
Minton.
