FT  10 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Securicor decline checked by recovery in
second half at Cellnet operation


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


A SHARP recovery in second half profits at Cellnet, the cellular radio
network, helped limit the decline in profits at Securicor Group, the
security, parcels and communication company, writes Richard Gourlay.
Pre-tax profits in the year to September 30 fell 36 per cent to Pounds 33m
(Pounds 51.9m). Cellnet, in which Securicor and its sister company Security
Services have a 40 per cent stake, contributed operating profits of Pounds
31.9m (Pounds 38m). Group sales rose 6 per cent to Pounds 565.1m (Pounds
531.8m).
The profit was struck after a Pounds 2m redundancy charge, most of which
arose in the second half when the effect of the recession had been hardest
felt.
Earnings per share fell from 22.5p to 16.7p and the proposed final dividend
is raised to 1.72p, making a total for the year of 2.336p (2.123p).
Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive, said the result reflected a sharp increase
in profitability at Cellnet. Towards the end of Securicor's year Cellnet had
started to erode what he called the 'traditional 15 per cent greater margin'
which Vodafone, the market leader, enjoyed on its core sales, ending the
year with a 45 per cent share of the market.
This was partly the result of a rapid increase in the number of users using
Cellnet's call back message facility who on average use the ser- vice 30 per
cent more than ordinary subscribers.
The level of user disconnections had increased for both Vodafone and Cellnet
with Cellnet suffering a marginally higher rate in the year to December.
They both finished the year with an average disconnection rate of a little
less than 25 per cent, Mr Wiggs said.
During the year Securicor made its first interest payment, of Pounds 2.46m,
since the 1988 rights issue. Gearing at the year end was 5 per cent.
There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.58m to cover losses on closure
of the group's motor dealerships in 1991 and the current year.
Operating profits in the security division, the traditional business, fell
from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 6.95m reflecting reduced demand by large
customers.
The packages delivery business suffered a 75 per cent slump in profits to
Pounds 2.37m. Mr Wiggs said large numbers of customers had switched from
premium to economy services which commanded much reduced margins.
Security Services, Securicor's 50.75 per cent subsidiary, made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 36.1m) on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds
511.23m.
Earnings per share fell to 12p (19.7p) and the proposed final dividend is
3.197p giving a total 10 per cent up for the year at 4.488p.
