FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Headline for market with Pounds
11m valuation


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


HEADLINE Book Publishing is coming to the main market by way of a placing of
5.73m shares which will raise about Pounds 4.8m net of expenses.
Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, managing director, said the listing should help
Headline to attract more prominent authors and enable it to take advantage
of any acquisition opportunities that might arise.
Proceeds of the placing - including 5.25m shares by the company - will go
towards reducing borrowings and financing further growth. The market
capitalisation of the group, at the placing price of 100p per ordinary
share, will be Pounds 11.1m.
Headline was founded in 1986 by four of the present directors. Pre-tax
profits for 1990 rose from Pounds 313,000 to Pounds 637,000, after a loss of
Pounds 115,000 in 1987, the first full year of trading. Sales have grown
from Pounds 1.59m in 1987 to Pounds 5.26m in 1989 and to Pounds 8.34m last
year. Earnings per share were 6.9p.
The group publishes popular books in both hardback and paperback. The
principal authors include Mr Dean R Koontz, the horror writer, Mr David
Morrell, the creator of Rambo, and Ms Ellis Peters, the writer of medieval
detective stories.
