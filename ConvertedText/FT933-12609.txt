FT  23 JUL 93 / Thorp testing set to win approval


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


BRITISH Nuclear Fuels is likely to be allowed to start uranium tests on its
Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria within weeks, the
Pollution Inspectorate and the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
said yesterday.
In a joint statement, the inspectorate and MAFF said they were 'minded' to
give the go-ahead to the tests 'on or after August 12'. Under the
Radioactive Substances Act 1960 the tests cannot start before local
authorities respond to test permission.
BNF has been waiting since January for a licence to begin operating the
Pounds 2.8bn plant which environmentalists have called the UK's biggest
white elephant.
The inspectorate and MAFF yesterday rejected claims that testing would
prejudice public consultation on the future of Thorp, which is due to start
within weeks and is likely to last until late this year. Greenpeace, the
environmental pressure group, said last night that it was considering a
legal challenge to the decision.
BNF said yesterday that the tests 'would enable BNF to retain up to 700
contract staff who would otherwise have their contracts terminated this
month'.
