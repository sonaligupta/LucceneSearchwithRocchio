FT  01 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow barely changed awaiting
fresh data

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US equities finished mostly flat yesterday as traders awaited important
economic data due out today and on Friday, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.68 at 3,739.23. The
Standard & Poor's 500 lost 1.48 at 453.69, while the American Stock Exchange
composite gained 0.77 at 433.86. The Nasdaq composite dipped 1.16 to 750.32.
NYSE trading volume came to 298.6m shares.
For most of the afternoon, the Dow held steady at about 15 points above
Tuesday's close. Program trading was credited with driving the index down in
the last hour of trading. The morning saw the market reacting to differing
signals about inflationary pressures in the economy.
Capacity utilisation figures for October were revised downward, while the
Commerce Department revised its estimate of gross domestic product up. A
survey by Chicago purchasing managers showed business activity up at 67.4
per cent in November from 64.3 per cent in October and a sharp increase in
the 'prices paid' component of the report from 72.5 per cent to 79.4 per
cent.
While the Chicago survey is not considered an extremely important figure, it
is taken as an indicator of the direction of the National Association of
Purchasing Managers' figures due out this morning.
Although news of the slowing of the economy is generally bad for the stock
market, lately investors are watching for any news that might put off
another interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
The upward revision in GDP figures boosted shares in large cyclicals, which
generally gain from a strong economy. Aluminum Company of America moved up
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 , Caterpillar Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54,
Dupont Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 , Union Carbide Dollars  7/8 to
Dollars 28 5/8 and International Paper Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 71 1/2 .
Most major pharmaceutical stocks posted increases. Pfizer appreciated
Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 77 3/8 , Eli Lilly Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 62 5/8
and Warner Lambert Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/8 .
Apache, the oil and gas company, jumped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 28 on news
that it had agreed to buy more than 300 oil and gas fields from Texaco for
Dollars 600m. Texaco hardened Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 .
American Brands, the consumer goods company, put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 35
3/8 on news that it would sell its insurance unit to American General for
Dollars 1.2bn. The latter firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 .
ADRs of two of Mexico's largest companies, Telemex and Grupo Televisa, both
retreated in spite of news generally considered positive for both that the
telecommunications group would acquire 49 per cent of Televisa's cable
subsidiary Cablevision for Dollars 211m. Telmex shed Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 53 and Televisa fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 45 1/4 .
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo, strong in the morning as investors continued to buy on
lower interest rates and forecasts of a reduction in inflation during
December, fell back as anxiety ahead of the outcome of a National Monetary
Council - Brazil's highest economic body - meeting being held yesterday
triggered strong profit-taking late in the session.
The Bovespa index lost 160 or 0.3 per cent on the day at 46,560, having
risen 2.9 per cent at one stage. Volume was high at RDollars 448.6m (Dollars
528.4m), but brokers said around 50 per cent of the total was due to a huge
box operation involving Telebras options. This involves a combination of two
call and two put options.
Merrill Lynch said it expected Brazil's stock markets to grow by 50 per cent
in 1995 and to outperform all other major emerging markets in Latin America.
Merrill added that the country was a good investment option because
prospects for a period of sustained economic growth were good.
Brazil's stabilisation plan, which included the introduction of a new
currency on July 1, had cut inflation to around 3 per cent in November from
50 per cent in June.
Merrill cautioned that the stabilisation plan had yet to overcome a few
obstacles before it achieved long term success. These included reforms to
the economy, welfare and taxation.
Canada
Toronto mirrored the New York market trend, seeing an initial advance lost
by afternoon selling. Early firm sentiment was helped by Canada's stronger
than expected third-quarter gross domestic product data and improved metals
prices, but this gave way to fresh nervousness over interest rates.
The TSE 300 index was finally a net 10.31 points down at 4,093.41, but rises
led declines by 404 to 368. The index had been up almost 25 points in late
morning. Volume was a moderate 63.4m shares. Golds fell 2.6 per cent.
