FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chairman of LSE makes pitch for
Chinese custom

A strong pitch for Chinese companies to choose London when seeking an
overseas listing was made yesterday by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of
the London Stock Exchange.
Opening an investment seminar in Beijing, he told bankers, securities
managers and stock regulators that the London market had the breadth of
experience and liquidity to benefit Chinese companies seeking overseas
capital.
'Companies raise more money if they issue shares on a market like London's,
where there is much investor interest and liquidity,' said Sir Andrew.
The invisibles seminar, organised by the China-Britain Trade Group, was
partly aimed at countering a trend among Chinese companies to look first at
Hong Kong and New York when considering an overseas listing.
Some six mainland companies have listed in Hong Kong in the past year or so,
and one of these - Shanghai Petrochemical - secured a joint listing in New
York.
Another 22 Chinese companies, including a number from the power sector, are
under consideration for overseas listings. Several have indicated an
interest in floating their shares in London.
Sir Andrew, who will sign a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai
stock exchange to facilitate co-operation in trading and listing, said the
London exchange would rationalise listing requirements to eliminate
differences.
Seminar organisers said there was a good response from Chinese participants
who indicated they had not been aware of the extent of business on the
London market where some 200 new companies sought listings last year,
raising Dollars 38bn in equity capital.
