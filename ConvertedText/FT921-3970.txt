FT  11 MAR 92 / Observer: Safe landing


The InterCity 125 heading for London last week went slower and slower, and
finally stopped. A voice came over the intercom: 'Good morning, ladies and
gentlemen, this is your senior conductor speaking. First, the bad news. Both
engines have failed.
'The good news is that you are not in a Boeing 767.'
