THOMSON Consumer Electronics, the French state-owned maker of audio-visual
products, is to invest Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.2m) in Poland over the next
three years as part of its strategy to enter low labour cost areas, writes
William Dawkins in Paris.
The cash will be used to boost capacity at a television tube making joint
venture, Thomson-Polkolor, in a suburb of Warsaw.
The aim is to produce 3m tubes annually there from 1993, a huge increase in
present capacity.
