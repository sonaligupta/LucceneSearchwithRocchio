FT  06 JAN 94 / Russia to pay Dollars 500mfor new parliament

The Russian government, strapped for cash and awash with property, is to
spend Dollars 500m on a new parliament after taking over the old one for
itself.
Mr Pavel Borodin, a senior official in President Boris Yeltsin's
administration, told the organising committee for the new parliament that
construction would begin next month and take 10 months. Contracts would be
awarded this month to foreign companies to erect the complex, complete with
a 700-room hotel for deputies.
The government has taken over the old parliament building with Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, prime minister, already occupying the office of the jailed
parliamentary speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.
The authorities have been unable to clear adequate space for the new federal
assembly. Its lower chamber is to be housed temporarily in the former
Comecon skyscraper, while the upper chamber is to sit in the former Soviet
construction ministry.
