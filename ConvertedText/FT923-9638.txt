FT  04 AUG 92 / 'Sick building' ills defy diagnosis


   By CATHERINE MILTON


EXTENSIVE research has found no identifiable cause or cure for 'sick
building syndrome', according to a report by the Health and Safety
Executive, Catherine Milton writes.
An HSE review published yesterday says the cause of the syndrome - in which
office workers blame buildings in which they work for symptoms such as
headaches, dry throats, mental fatigue and dizziness - remains a mystery,
and the syndrome is unlikely to go away in the short term.
The Institution of Environmental Health Officers said last year that local
authorities had received a total of 500 sick-building complaints. The HSE
said the issue was hard to quantify because some workers might not blame
their offices for the symptoms.
Dr Pam Buley, a senior health policy official at the HSE, said the situation
was 'as confused as ever', in spite of extensive research.
She said: 'Sick building syndrome is often associated with air-conditioned
buildings and seems to affect women more than men, especially workers who
are in a building for a long time.'
She said the complexity of the issue meant that a quick answer was unlikely.
The report says the syndrome occurs in even the best-designed buildings.
Poor air quality and inadequate ventilation, high temperatures and bad
lighting have been identified as risk factors.
The HSE is funding research at London University, which is comparing the
sickness and absence data of more than 10,000 office-based civil servants
with measurements of environmental factors and building maintenance records.
