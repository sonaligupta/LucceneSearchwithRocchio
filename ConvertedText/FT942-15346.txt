FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Hunting at Pounds 32m with help of
exceptionals


   By TIM BURT


Property disposals and the sale of subsidiaries last year helped Hunting
defy the recession in its aviation, defence and oil businesses.
Exceptional items totalling Pounds 8.1m underpinned a slight increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.7m in the 12 months to December 31, against
Pounds 29.2m last time.
The shares, however, fell 14p to 215p after the group showed a 16 per cent
decline in operating profits to Pounds 29.1m (Pounds 34.6m).
Mr Kenneth Miller, chief executive, blamed the operating downturn on hefty
restructuring costs of Pounds 5.8m and trading losses at subsidiaries which
have since been sold.
The reorganisation centred on the aviation business, where the group made
Pounds 2.9m of provisions to cover redundancies, the cost of selling Hunting
Aircraft - its lossmaking US subsidiary - and the amalgamation of more than
30 companies into five sub-divisions.
Operating profits in the aviation division, which suffered from deferred
orders and production cuts, fell from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 5m and the
workforce was reduced by 150 to less than 2,000.
Mr Miller, who warned a further 150 jobs would go this year, said: 'It was a
skinny performance and the business is not generating an adequate return on
investment. The restructuring will change that but it's not going to recover
in a hurry.'
The problems were partially offset by improved results in the defence and
oil divis-ions.
A nine-month contribution from the management contract for the Atomic
Weapons Establishment boosted defence profits to Pounds 14.6m (Pounds 9.3m).
The group made a Pounds 2.3m provision for relocating its communication
technology business.
The oil division saw profits increase by Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 17.8m despite
the falling price of crude, which it markets and supplies in North America.
Group turnover improved from Pounds 809.8m to Pounds 1.06bn, including
Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 30.1m) from discontinued activities. Earnings per share
fell from 15.7p to 13.6p, and a final dividend of 6p is proposed for an
unchanged 10p total.
COMMENT
With Pounds 15m of surplus property still on its books, there is nothing to
stop Hunting selling further assets to buoy this year's figures. It is an
attractive option given the fragility of the aviation and defence markets
and the recent slide in the oil price. But the balance sheet has been
strengthened by last year's Pounds 37m rights issue, cutting gearing from 78
per cent to 35 per cent, and that will allow the group to develop its
underlying businesses. It may take some time, however, for the benefits of
new orders to feed through. So although profits this year could reach Pounds
33m on a forward multiple of 15.5, the shares could prove a costly
short-term option.
