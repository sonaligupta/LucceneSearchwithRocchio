FT  27 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Copper
advance gathers pace


   By RICHARD MOONEY


THE RECENT upturn in copper prices gathered pace this week as concern
deepened about the availability of supplies. The London Metal Exchange cash
price closed yesterday near a 7 1/2 -month high at Pounds 1,252.50 a tonne,
up Pounds 10 on the week. But the full extent of the advance was obscured by
a rise in sterling's value against the US dollar. If the currency factor is
allowed for cash copper's true rise on the week works out at Pounds 31.50 a
tonne. In dollar terms the price this week reached its highest level for
more than a year.
The price rise is being encouraged at present by worries over slow progress
in labour contract talks at Asarco of the US, which produces about 450,000
tonnes of copper a year, labour tensions in the Polish copper industry, and
troublesome weather in Chilean mining areas.
The longer term supply outlook also appears more bullish. Mr William Adams
of London broker Rudolf Wolff said this week that a world copper supply
deficit of about 100,000 tonnes was now expected for 1992, instead of the
50,000-tonne surplus being predicted at the beginning of the year.
The market for copper and other metals was receiving little encouragement
from the supply side, however, according to Mr David Humphries, an economist
at the RTZ Corporation. He said metal demand was falling in Japan, which
accounted for 18 per cent of world usage, while prospects were dim in the
EC, accounting for 30 per cent, because Germany was 'coming off the boil'.
Only in the US, which accounts for a quarter of world usage, was metal
demand showing signs of recovery.
That situation would appear to bode ill for the zinc market, especially as
the metal is in heavy oversupply - a 2,750-tonnes rise in LME warehouse
stocks this week took the total to a record 327,550 tonnes, up from 156,800
tonnes at the beginning of the year. But a long-running, options-related
supply squeeze is continuing to underpin the market, in spite of the LME's
recent action to take some heat out of the situation.
In the two week's since the exchange announced the imposition of a
descending ceiling on the daily premium during the June/July period (the
immediate focus of the squeeze) the cash premium over three months metal has
fallen from Dollars 189 to Dollars 57.50 a tonne. For most of that time the
cash and three months prices themselves were also falling and traders were
saying that the fundamental supply/demand situation was beginning to be
reflected. But this week saw that price trend reversed. By last night's
close the cash position was quoted at Dollars 1,356 a tonne, up Dollars 55
on the week and Dollars 66 off Tuesday's low, while the three months price
was Dollars 1,298.50 a tonne, up Dollars 101 on the week and Dollars 100.50
off Monday's low.
'There has been so much technical activity in the zinc market I'm reluctant
to say whether any price movement is evidence of anything at all,' was Mr
Humphries' comment.
Tin traders are faced with no such problems of interpretation. Supplies of
good quality tin are tight, overall world stocks are at a manageble level
and mine output is falling. As a result the market has moved steadily
upwards in recent weeks.
Tuesday saw something of a shake-out but support quickly appeared and by
yesterday's close cash tin was trading at Dollars 6,950 a tonne, having
added Dollars 192.50 to last week's Dollars 297.50 rise.
Although coffee traders at the London Futures and Options Exchange were
holding out little hope of significant progress being made towards a price
stabilising International Coffee Agreement at this week's London talks, they
were reluctant to sell while there was the slightest chance of a positive
outcome. But that reluctance appeared to evaporate as the talks approached
last night's scheduled conclusion with nothing having happened to contradict
the traders' pessimism. The September robustas futures contract ended the
day Dollars 23 lower at Dollars 686 a tonne, down Dollars 20 on the week.
In the cocoa market, meanwhile, the expectation of further selling by the
debt-ridden Ivory Coast and Ghana was enough to push prices to a succession
of fresh 16 1/2 year lows until the September position reached Pounds 509 a
tonne on Thursday. The price recovered to end the week at Pounds 535 a
tonne, up Pounds 1 on balance, but traders were not ready to suggest that
that the bear trend might be over. Bargain hunting was a more likely
explanation for the late rally, they said.
