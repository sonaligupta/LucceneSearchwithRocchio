FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP outperforms


UK oil major BP was one of the few firm features in the FT-SE 100 list as
some of the larger securities houses stressed their enthusiasm for the stock
ahead of third-quarter figures at the beginning of November.
NatWest Securities, a long-time supporter of the stock, published a sizeable
review of the company and pointed out that the shares had underperformed the
FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 5 per cent since the start of the month. The
house said the recent slide in the dollar had been more than offset by the
rise in the oil price. It added that the third-quarter figures should
reflect a rise of 13 per cent on the previous year's equivalent period
compared to falls of around 9 per cent in US rivals.
Meanwhile, Smith New Court argued that the recent divergence between the UK
and US oil sectors was easily explained by specific factors and that BP
still represented good value. The shares ended the day 5 up at 408p with
5.7m traded.
