FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Reynolds renews Irish unity call


MR ALBERT REYNOLDS, the Irish prime minister, last night reiterated his wish
to see a united Ireland but conceded that a more conciliatory approach is
needed towards the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.
In a speech in the US on policy towards Northern Ireland he also ruled out
any concessions on the Republic of Ireland's constitution as a pre-condition
for renewed all-party talks.
Mr Reynolds' statements are his strongest yet and appear to have been made
in response to backbench criticism that his government's Ulster policy is
being dictated by the Labour party, Fianna Fail's coalition partners.
The Irish government recently welcomed a meeting between Mr John Hume, the
SDLP leader and Mr Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA. The meeting was strongly condemned by Unionist leaders.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, will set out more of his
thinking on the province in a speech today.
