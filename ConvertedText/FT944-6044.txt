FT  01 DEC 94 / Court gives Tapie a chance


   By JOHN RIDDING


   PARIS


Mr Bernard Tapie, the French populist politician and tycoon, yesterday won a
reprieve in his struggle to secure his financial and political future when a
Paris commercial court ruled that his remaining business interests should be
placed in receivership rather than wound up. The ruling, which freezes Mr
Tapie's assets for six months and allows a court-appointed administrator to
try to rescue his businesses, removes the prospect of imminent bankruptcy
for the left-wing Euro-MP and French deputy. Under French law, bankrupts
cannot stand for election to public office for five years, dashing his
political career.
Mr Tapie has set his sights on becoming mayor of Marseilles in elections
next year. He has also indicated that he might run for next spring's
presidential elections following the strong showing of his Radical Energy
list in last June's European elections. Mr Tapie welcomed the court's
decision. 'I am very satisfied because my companies and their employees will
survive,' he said. He accused his creditors of seeking to end his political
career.
Yesterday's ruling was the most important of a series of legal disputes
which have dogged the flamboyant French deputy. He faces a spate of suits
from creditors, in particular Credit Lyonnais, the loss-making state-owned
bank which funded his rapid business expansion in the 1980s and which is now
attempting to recoup loans estimated at FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m).
