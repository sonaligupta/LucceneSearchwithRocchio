FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GKN 90.9% acceptance in loan stock rights
issue


GKN yesterday announced it had received acceptances in respect of almost 50m
units of non-interest bearing convertible loan stock, representing about
90.9 per cent of the units offered in its recent rights issue.
The units are priced at 480p apiece and are payable in two equal
instalments.
Subscribers have been procured at a premium for the 4.83m units for which
valid acceptances were not received.
The second instalment of 240p per stock unit remains conditional on the
offers for Westland becoming wholly unconditional and GKN achieving 75 per
cent ownership of Westland.
SG Warburg is acting for GKN in connection with the offers and the rights
issue.
