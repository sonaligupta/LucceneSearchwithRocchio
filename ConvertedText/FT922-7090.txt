FT  20 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US group to put millions into European
factory


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


MORTON International, the US chemicals and car components group, is to
invest 'hundreds of millions of dollars' in a European factory making
emergency airbags for cars. The project will create 1,700 jobs by 1995,
rising to 3,000 in five years, the company said.
It will be a joint venture with Robert Bosch, the German engineering group,
which will make the sensing and diagnostic equipment to trigger airbag
inflation designed to protect passengers in a car crash.
Morton, which claims US market leadership in the field, will make the bags.
The company's initial list of 100 potential European locations will be cut
to three or five in July. Two UK sites are contenders, one in Clwyd,
north-east Wales, the other in Consett, Co Durham.
Ms Nancy Hobor, head of corporate communications at Morton's Chicago base,
said yesterday: 'We have spent Dollars 300m (Pounds 170m) developing this
market in the US and would expect the European investment to be of a similar
order.'
The Clwyd site is near Toyota's new factory near Chester and Wrexham;
Consett is within a few miles of Nissan's Sunderland plant. Both have good
motorway links to other carmakers in Britain. Morton has a chemicals
operation in Germany, also a contender for the factory because of the size
of the German car-making sector and the Bosch connection.
