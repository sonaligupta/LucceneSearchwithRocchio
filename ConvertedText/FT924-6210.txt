FT  23 NOV 92 / Further 3,000 jobs to go at Barclays


   By ROBERT PESTON


BARCLAYS BANK will today announce that the number of UK based jobs it is
planning to shed in its four-year redundancy programme is being increased
from 15,000 to 18,000, Robert Peston writes.
The increase is linked to an acceleration in its branch closure programme.
Barclays told employees on Friday that it was planning to reduce the number
of its branches from 2,280 to 1,900 by the end of 1995. Last year Barclays
closed 110 branches and 120 are expected to go this year.
The job cuts may involve some compulsory redundancies, although the bank
will seek to use a voluntary redundancy scheme where possible.
Barclays' four-year redundancy programme began nearly two years ago. Last
year staff numbers in its UK banking operations were reduced by 5,000 and a
further 3,500 are expected to go this year. The UK banking operations now
employ 56,000.
The axe will fall predominantly on smaller suburban branches.
