FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (21): Lubricating the cash flow - A
cost-effective and efficient mechanism for expediting payments by cheque in
Europe, Britain and the US / Lock boxes


   By MARK RUNIEWICZ


THERE are times when it is not good news to hear that 'the cheque is in the
post'. Not when it may take four weeks to clear. When cash flow is critical,
every day lost before the cheque is cleared can be costly. But a 'lock box'
can change all that.
Even though there are quicker ways of getting paid - like electronic
transfer (though even this can be delayed if you fail to provide the buyer
with full and accurate details, including a bank identification code) -
still a large share of trade around Europe is settled by cheque.
Some buyers prefer cheques as a deliberate ploy to delay payment: after it
arrives, the cheque must be presented to a local bank branch, which will in
turn forward it to the national headquarters of your company's bank, which
must in turn present it to the buyer's bank overseas.
This loop can take 28 days to clear.
Many companies are also unaware that, when they present cheques drawn on an
overseas bank to their bank and their account is immediately credited with
sterling, they are receiving an advance. The bank charges interest for the
advance, which is built into the exchange rate and is called a negotiation.
Should the cheque be countermanded or unpaid when presented to the overseas
bank on which it is drawn, the UK bank will reclaim the advance converting
sterling into the currency of the cheque at the prevailing exchange rate.
One (typical) UK company receives cheques from its German buyer drawn on a
bank in Frankfurt. The UK company pays the cheques into its UK bank account
and immediately receives sterling. A recent cheque was received for
DM250,000 and was converted at the cheque buying rate of DM2.4875 to the
pound, providing Pounds 100,502 less bank charges of Pounds 60. The company
also had this advance marked against its banking facilities.
Had the German buyer remitted the funds electronically the UK supplier would
have received a further Pounds 874 at an exchange rate of DM2.4675 to the
pound. The UK company receives 20 cheques a year from this source but was
not aware of the hidden costs in excess of Pounds 17,000 per annum accruing
by transacting business using this method. The company was selling to other
markets in a similar manner and costs in excess of Pounds 65,000 were
identified.
So exporters should remember that the buyer extends the credit period at
their expense.
If you have no choice but to accept payment by cheque, the 'lock box'
arrangement can also be used to cut the payment loop back to five days. It
works like this: if the buyer is a German company you set up a 'lock box'
bank account with a reputable German bank.
You then ask the German buyer to present the cheque to the German bank,
giving full account details of the 'lock box'.
This clears at the same speed of a domestic cheque, and once deposited can
be notified to your main banker in France, the UK or elsewhere in Europe.
The cheque will not only be cleared quickly, but the funds can be remitted
electronically to the exporter's UK bank account.
The lock box is available in Europe, north America and the UK and provides a
cost-effective and efficient solution for companies receiving cheques drawn
overseas and helps exporters avoid one of the tripwires in trading overseas.
