FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Hampson still waiting for recovery


Hampson Industries, the West Midlands-based industrial company, said it was
still awaiting a recovery as it reported interim pre-tax profits down by 39
per cent.
However, Mr John Wardle, chairman, said the second half should return to
normal patterns and show a marked improvement. Though he added that it would
owe nothing 'to any vague hopes of an improvement in the economic scene'.
Profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 2.64m)
on turnover of Pounds 37.1m (Pounds 36.6m). Earnings per share came out at
1.36p (2.48p) basic or 1.45p (2.38p) diluted and the interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.6p.
