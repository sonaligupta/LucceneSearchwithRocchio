FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Unit plans rights and restructuring


Unit Group, the lossmaking USM-traded timber pallet manufacturer, has
announced moves to reduce its borrowings and finance a restructuring via a
subscription and rights issue.
Glenbank, a private company controlled by Mr J Wilton and Mr Harry Sproule,
is taking 26 per cent of the enlarged capital through subscription for 2.77m
shares at 24p apiece, raising Pounds 666,000 before expenses.
Mr Wilton and Mr Sproule will join the Unit board.
The rights issue of up to 2.47m shares, on a 5-for-11 basis, also at 24p,
will raise Pounds 592,000, conditional on the subscription taking place.
The measures will result in gearing falling from 129 per cent to 44 per
cent.
Unit anticipates pre-tax losses of not more than Pounds 1.64m for the 12
months to March 31 1994, of which Pounds 750,000 will cover closure and
reorganisation costs.
