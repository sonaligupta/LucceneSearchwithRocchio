FT  27 SEP 94 / Observer: A bronze for Nipper?


So what do Thorn EMI chairman Sir Colin Southgate, Richard Budge, boss of
RJB Mining, United Arab Emirates ambassador Easa Saleh Al Gurg and Morgan
Stanley's Steven Ward have in common?
Nothing much that they knew of until they arrived at Le Manoir Aux Quat'
Saisons outside Oxford last Saturday as guests of its chef and proprietor
Raymond Blanc. The occasion was a celebration of the work of a husband and
wife team of sculptors, Lloyd Le Blanc and Judith Holmes Drewry. Most of the
90-odd worthies who turned up seemed unaware that their 'discovery' was so
widely shared.
The two - she does figures and he does wildlife - dispense with a London
gallery, instead wooing prospective clients to their Leicestershire studios.
Several guests had bronzes of their family in the garden, while others
prefered animals such as yearling calves. Indeed, with HMV celebrating its
75th anniversary in 1996, a bronze Nipper may soon be listening intently to
His Master's Voice in Southgate's office.
