FT  15 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: German repo eyed


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


The European currency markets' main focus this week will be the Bundesbank's
latest allocation of securities repurchase agreements, amid hopes that the
repo rate could ease again, writes Conner Middelmann.
After the German call money rate eased some 20 basis points last week to
trade around 6.25 per cent on Friday, many traders were looking for a
repo-rate reduction this week of some 5-10 basis points from last week's
6.38 per cent minimum rate.
The Bundesbank's policy-setting central bank council will meet on Thursday,
but few market participants are expecting it to cut Germany's leading
Discount and Lombard rates.
However, some market participants say the Netherlands may lower its 6.10 per
cent special advances money market rate next week, independent of any
Bundesbank move. Dutch call money has been trading below the special
advances rate most of this week while the guilder remains the strongest
currency in the European Monetary System.
The UK markets are in for a busy week, with data on retail prices, public
sector borrowing, retail sales, money supply, unemployment and trade, as
well as revised data on third-quarter gross domestic product. The numbers
are expected to confirm the general picture of a slow but steady recovery.
However, sterling is widely expected to continue trading in a relatively
narrow range ahead of the November 30 Budget.
The dollar's fortunes will hinge on Wednesday's US Congressional vote on the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the outcome of which is still
uncertain. The dollar is expected to press upwards against a resistance
point at DM1.7000.
