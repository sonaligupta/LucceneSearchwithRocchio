FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical slides
6.5% - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up

YAMANOUCHI Pharmaceutical, a leading Japanese drug manufacturer, yesterday
blamed lower interest rates and capital increases at overseas subsidiaries
for a 6.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y57.1bn (Dollars 517m) for the
year to March.
Net profits dropped by 13 per cent to Y27.2bn last year, while sales rose
7.9 per cent to Y243.6bn due to steady demand for the company's anti-ulcer
drug in the Japanese market.
Yamanouchi's shares, which trade on the first section of the Tokyo stock
exchange, were under pressure from profit-taking during yesterday's session,
ending Y60 lower at Y2,480.
Mr Toshide Yoda, a pharmaceutical sector analyst at UBS Securities, predicts
pre-tax profit declines for the overall drug industry once the government
establishes a fixed-priced system in an effort to control the expansion of
healthcare costs.
Drugs totalled about 30.8 per cent of the entire healthcare bill in Japan
last year, compared with less than 15 per cent in most western countries, he
said.
Yamanouchi expects a slight growth in unconsolidated pretax profits at
Y57.5bn for the current financial year, with net profits at Y28bn, and a 6.7
per cent increase in sales to Y260bn.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, the Japanese drugmaker specialising in antibiotics,
reported a 46.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y22.7bn last year due to
strong sales of oral drugs. These sales increased by 4.2 per cent to Y236bn.
However, the Osaka-based company posted a sharp 76.9 per cent fall in net
profits to Y1.3bn due to substantial evaluation losses on its holding of
shares of Fujisawa USA. These losses totalled about Y6.5bn.
The company expects unchanged earnings for the current fiscal year, with
pre-tax profits at Y21bn, and sales at Y236bn.
Shionogi, a pharmaceutical maker engaged mainly in antibiotics, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits climbed by 11.0 per cent to Y21.6bn for the last
fiscal year, and attributed the gain to steady demand.
