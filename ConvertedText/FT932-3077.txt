FT  16 JUN 93 / Free-flights travel agent stops trading


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and DAVID OWEN


JSI TRAVEL, the company handling a free-flights promotion for the Dixons and
Currys electrical retail chains, ceased trading yesterday.
The travel company, based in Dorset, was also the agent for the Hoover
free-flights offer which was at the centre of controversy over bookings late
last year. JSI was later replaced as Hoover's agent by two other travel
companies.
Dixons, which owns the Currys chain, said last night that it had taken over
the administration of JSI and that all flights would go ahead as planned. It
said 11,000 customers had qualified for flights to 12 European destinations
under the promotion, which ended in April.
The Association of British Travel Agents said last night that JSI's
membership had been terminated last month after it had failed to renew its
bond.
