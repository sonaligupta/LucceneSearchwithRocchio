FT  01 DEC 94 / Tax drive underpins budget

Greece's Socialist government yesterday proposed a budget for 1995 that
relies on a fresh crackdown against tax evasion to boost revenues. The
budget provides for an 18.5 per cent increase in revenues to Dr7,400bn
(Pounds 18.4bn) but does not impose any new taxes. The bulk of the revenue
increase is projected to come from broadening Greece's tax base and curbing
tax evasion among the 800,000 self-employed workers. With an early election
possible next spring, the Socialists have decided against making spending
cuts. The budget projects an overall rise in expenditure of 9.7 per cent to
Dr9,925bn, including increased outlays on defence, health and education.
However, wage restraints will continue, with rises for public sector workers
being held below the inflation rate, projected to fall to 7.9 per cent by
the end of 1995. The general government deficit is projected to drop to 9.8
per cent of gross domestic product from 12 per cent of GDP this year.
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has said he will not run for the
presidency next spring. The ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement must now
find an alternative candidate. Parliament is due to vote for a new head of
state by May when President Constantine Karamanlis, 87, is due to step down.
