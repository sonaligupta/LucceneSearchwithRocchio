FT  29 APR 94 / French take to investing


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN

The French privatisation programme has brought 2.5m first time share buyers
into the market, according to a survey by the Commissions des Operations de
Bourse, the French stock market watchdog, and the Sofres market research
consultancy. This increase in the number of private investors to 7m reverses
the late 1980s trend whereby the French switched out of equities to return
to cash investments such as Sicavs, the popular money market funds. The
number of shareholders in France rose to 6.2m in 1987, at the height of the
last centre-right government's privatisation programme, only to fall to 4.5m
by late 1992.
