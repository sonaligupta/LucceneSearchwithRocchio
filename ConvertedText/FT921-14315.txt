FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: New fair trader


If Britain is more competitive than it was 16 years ago, you can thank Sir
Gordon Borrie.
When he took over from John Methven, the first director general of fair
trading, Shirley Williams was running the department of prices and consumer
protection, and he has had over a dozen different political bosses since
then. Amid the whirligig of the UK's sometimes erratic competition policy,
Borrie has been the one constant factor.
Although the 60-year-old law professor was appointed by an interventionist
Labour government, he has keen political antennae as well as a robust
intellect which have served him well. He gives the impression of being
impervious to pressure, yet has been able to adjust his policies to the
political mood of the day.
During his term, the job of director general of fair trading has grown in
importance. This may be partly due to the fact that under Margaret
Thatcher's free-market regime, politicians did not want to be seen to be
interfering. But it also reflects Borrie's own distinct contribution.
All the same, he had been doing the job for too long. After 16 years of
dealing with civil servants, even the strongest personality is liable to
start acting like one. Promoting Sir Bryan Carsberg makes obvious sense. He
has been the telecom watchdog for long enough and also needed a change.
