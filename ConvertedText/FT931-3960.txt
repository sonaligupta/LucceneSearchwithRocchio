FT  12 MAR 93 / Bundestag warned on plan to curb asylum

   BONN


GERMANY'S plan to change its constitution and curb the influx of asylum
seekers is incompatible with the Geneva Convention on refugees, the German
parliament was warned yesterday.
Mr Walter Koisser, of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in
Bonn, told the constitutional committee of the Bundestag: 'Every refugee
must have the chance of fair asylum proceedings, whether he came by air, sea
or from a third country which is judged unsafe.'
Germany is considering amendments to its liberal asylum law which would
allow asylum seekers to be sent back over the German border to third
countries such as Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary.
Mr Koisser said the plan would 'violate human rights' unless at least three
conditions were met: asylum seekers must be able to stay in the third
country until the asylum request is processed, they must be given decent
living conditions, and third countries must be declared safe by
international agreements.
He said there was otherwise a danger of 'chain-deportation' which would
imperil the international asylum system.
Mr Koisser recommended an amendment specifying that third countries must
offer protection from persecution and ensure the Geneva Convention on
refugees is respected.
