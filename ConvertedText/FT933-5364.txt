FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reckitt improves 14% to Pounds 153m -
Growth encouraging given background of international recession


   By MAGGIE URRY


THE FALL in sterling helped Reckitt & Colman, the household products and
toiletries group, report interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 153.2m, up 14.2
per cent from the previous year's Pounds 134.2m, restated at Pounds 82m
under FRS 3, taking account of losses on the sale of its US spice business.
It was pointed out that excluding the exchange rate benefit, sales and
operating profits rose about 3 per cent in the half-year to end-June.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said the growth was encouraging given the
background of international recession.
Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said profit margins had been maintained
thanks to increasing investment in key areas and products and to continuing
efficiency gains. Cash flow was strong, he added. The group increased its
interim dividend from 5.95p to 6.45p because the first half had been 'on
track with our plans,' Mr Sankey said.
Group sales were 9 per cent higher at Pounds 1.07bn, with turnover of
continuing operations up 14 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 172.7m,
up 21 per cent, or 14.3 per cent from continuing operations.
Net interest charges rose from Pounds 17m to Pounds 19.5m because of the
translation of foreign currency payments. Net debt fell to Pounds 311.9m at
the end of the half year, down from Pounds 360.9m a year ago and from Pounds
314.7m at the year-end. Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said debt should
fall to about Pounds 250m by the end of 1993 barring acquisitions or changes
in exchange rates.
UK operating profits of Pounds 35m were flat with margins held at 19.6 per
cent. Mr Sankey said a poor period for soft drinks offset improved results
from household and pharmaceutical products. Continental Europe contributed
operating profits 10.8 per cent higher at Pounds 50.1m, though in local
currencies profits were static. A decline in profits from Spain offset rises
elsewhere. The reorganisation of the US business pushed North American
operating profits up 35 per cent to Pounds 34.8m and margins up from 10.2 to
11.9 per cent, despite a weaker performance in Canada.
Australasia and Asia raised profits 24 per cent to Pounds 27.8m, an
underlying increase of over 10 per cent. Africa, mainly South Africa,
contributed Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 12.2m). The Latin American business raised
profits 15 per cent to Pounds 11.9m, despite difficulties caused by high
inflation in Brazil.
Earnings per share were 24.88p, up from 7.93p on an FRS 3 basis or from
21.85p on an adjusted basis.
COMMENT
Even Reckitt's management recognises the group is going through a boring
phase while its 1992 strategy of going for investment generated growth takes
time to work through. Underlying growth of 3 per cent is certainly dull. But
Reckitt has its quiet merits. Operating margins of 16.2 per cent are high
and seem sustainable, it pushes out cash, and the dividend keeps moving up.
The shares have been poor performers in the downturn but have had a run up
in recent weeks. On forecasts of about Pounds 280m pre-tax for the year,
against Pounds 248.3m or Pounds 181.7m under FRS 3, the prospective p/e is
14.5 which is neither dear, nor likely to provoke outperformance.
