FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refuge dividend rise boosts share price


   By JOHN AUTHERS


REFUGE GROUP, the life assurance company, yesterday increased its total
dividend for 1992 by 9 per cent, from 29p to 31.5p, with a recommended final
of 21.9p.
The shares rose from 994p to Pounds 10.20p.
Profits after tax rose from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 14.4m reflecting growth
in life net premium income from Pounds 205m to Pounds 229m. Earnings per
share were higher at 28.13p, compared with 25.81p.
The profit was struck after losses of Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.9m) relating to
discontinued activities and an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.01m (Pounds
2.7m) against RLJ Finance, a personal loans subsidiary.
The bulk of RLJ's performing loan book was sold in November and external
debt collectors were appointed in January.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 593,000) included the loss
of Pounds 8.24m on the sale of Douglas Allen Spiro, the estate agency
business, announced last week. Mr Tom Booth, chairman, said: 'The chances of
a return to adequate profitability over the next two or three years were
considered to be slim.'
Refuge found, in common with several other life companies, that the life
assurance sales generated by the estate agency did not justify continuing
with the business.
There was an an extraordinary profit of Pounds 4.92m on the sale of
Canterbury Life, a small life assurance company, to the ordinary life fund
of Refuge Assurance.
