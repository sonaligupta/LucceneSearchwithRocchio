FT  28 APR 94 / Canberra caution on interest rates


   By NIKKI TAIT


Australia's consumer price index rose by 0.4 per cent in the March quarter,
putting the country's annual inflation rate at 1.4 per cent, writes Nikki
Tait. This represents a dip from the December quarter, when the CPI
increased by 0.2 per cent, to give an annual rate of 1.9 per cent.
Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, took advantage of the news to
stress that there was no reason for interest rates to rise in the
'foreseeable future', and to criticise dealers who have driven money market
rates higher, largely in response to interest rates rises in the US.
Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, added that he believed the bond markets -
where yields have also been rising - had lost credibility as a guide to
inflationary expectations.
