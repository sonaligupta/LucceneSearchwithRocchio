FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Waste services behind Shanks & McEwan rise


   By PAUL TAYLOR


A strong performance by the waste services division offset further
disappointing results from the Rechem hazardous waste business and helped
Shanks & McEwan report a 5 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 1 increased to Pounds 9.82m
(Pounds 9.35m) on turnover up 10 per cent to Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 63.2m).
Earnings per share were slightly ahead at 3.6p (3.5p).
The group, which announced a sharp reduction in its dividend in June after
unveiling a full year pre-tax loss, is paying a 1.1p interim dividend in
line with its new dividend policy, down from 2.24p a year earlier. The
shares closed down 2p at 89p.
Mr Michael Averill, who took over as chief executive after his predecessor,
Mr Roger Hewitt, stepped down in January, highlighted the group's first half
net cash receipts of Pounds 9m which enabled the group to reduce its net
debt from Pounds 30.9m at the year-end to Pounds 21.9m. Gearing has fallen
from 46 per cent to 30 per cent.
Overall operating profits increased by 8.2 per cent to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds
10.3m) with a 49 per cent increase in profits from the waste services
division offseting lower profits environmental services and a Pounds 840,000
loss (Pounds 722,000) in construction services.
Waste services, which mostly deals with the disposal of household,
commercial and industrial waste, increased to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 7.69m) on
turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 45m (Pounds 37.3m). The profit improvement
mainly reflected higher volumes and margins and the re-appearance of
significant contaminated spoil contracts in the south of England.
In contrast environmental services, including Rechem, which specialises in
hazardous waste incineration, and technical services, which concentrates on
the handling, treatment and disposal of special and difficult wastes,
reported a fall to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 4.58m) on turnover lower at Pounds
16.7m (Pounds 19.8m).
Rechem was responsible for the bulk of the decline with profits falling from
Pounds 3.3m to just Pounds 200,000 and turnover dropping by 23 per cent.
Price pressures at Rechem's Fawley and Pontypool incenerator complexes,
reflecting both a lower level of higher margin imports and competition from
cement kilns, were blamed.
Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, noted that there is, 'unfortunately no material
improvement in prospect for either, despite the encouraging statements on
government policy'.
