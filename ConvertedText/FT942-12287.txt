FT  30 APR 94 / Poland may end wage controls: International News Digest


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


The Polish government has told Solidarity it will consider removal of wage
controls if the trade union agrees to a highly controversial reform of the
country's pension system which has been long demanded by the International
Monetary Fund. Yesterday Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister (left),
criticised Solidarity for organising strike action but offered to talk about
the union's demands within the framework of a tripartite committee bringing
together representatives of unions, employers and the government which also
met yesterday. Pensions are linked to wage levels throughout the economy and
increase periodically as wages rise.
Mr Pawlak said removal of state wage controls by the end of this year would
have to be accompanied by a change to indexing pensions. Economists have
long warned that the present system represents an impossible burden on the
state budget.
