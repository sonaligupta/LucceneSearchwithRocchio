FT  11 JAN 92 / International Company News: Car investment to exceed DM6bn
this year - The company's plans for expansion as it faces growing cost
competition


   By KEVIN DONE


Mercedes-Benz, the car and commercial vehicle subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of
Germany, is planning to assemble cars in Mexico from mid-1993.
The company will also begin production at its new DM1.4bn (Dollars 933m)
assembly plant at Rastatt, Germany in March with the aim of increasing total
car production capacity to around 620,000 by the mid-1990s. Sales peaked in
1986 at 597,000.
Mr Jurgen Hubbert, head of the Mercedes-Benz car division, said investment
in the car operations would rise to more than DM6bn this year from DM5.3bn
in 1991, of which some DM4bn would be capital investment and DM2bn would be
spent on research and development for new products.
The company is planning to launch a new generation 190 range, its smallest
car, in 1993, followed by the renewal of the mid-range 200/300 series at the
end of 1994.
Last year it launched its new top-of-the-range S-Class luxury car and this
week unveiled the S-Class coupe in Detroit, the first time a major product
line for world markets has been unveiled in the US.
Output of the coupe is planned to reach 6,000 to 8,000 a year, while S-Class
saloon production should reach full capacity of 370 a day or 80,000 a year
with full order books for the next 12 months.
Mr Hubbert acknowledged that Mercedes-Benz was facing increasingly stiff
cost competition, chiefly from Japanese car makers such as Toyota and Nissan
with their Lexus and Infiniti luxury car ranges.
He said that the Mercedes-Benz car division was intensifying its
cost-cutting campaign with the aim of reducing its 1991/92 cost base by
DM4bn by the mid-1990s. He said the company's costs had to be reduced by
20-30 per cent to become competitive with its Japanese rivals.
Mr Hubbert said the car operations in future would adhere only 'in
principle' to the concept 'made in Germany'. The company was 'quite open on
all questions of production location.'
Mercedes-Benz cars are already assembled in South Africa, Indonesia and
Thailand and small volume assembly will begin in Mexico next year.
Mr Hubbert said it was planned to produce 500-1,000 a year of its mid-range
200-300 series cars in Mexico with an investment of DM20m. Cars could be
exported to South America from Mexico, but the US market would be
exclusively supplied from Germany.
Production at the DM1.4bn Rastatt assembly plant in Germany would eventually
rise to 300 cars a day or 70-80,000 a year.
The initial DM500m phase to build a new assembly line for the mid-range
200/300 series has been completed and this will be followed in later stages
by the addition of paint shop and body welding operations.
Mr Hubbert said the Rastatt operations would be a model for the extensive
modernisation of Mercedes-Benz's other plants with a new type of work
organisation including flexible production stations.
Mercedes-Benz car sales worldwide fell slightly last year to 558,000 from
561,901 in 1990, with big falls in the US and in the UK compensated by
increases in Germany and Italy.
Mr Hubbert added the company was aiming to achieve sales of some 560,000 in
1992.
Sales in Germany rose by 7 per cent to 271,000, accounting for 48.5 per cent
of total Mercedes-Benz sales, while its foreign sales declined by 7 per cent
to 287,000.
Mercedes-Benz car sales in the US, its most important foreign market,
dropped by 24.9 per cent to 58,868 last year from 78,375 in 1990 and a peak
of just under 100,000 in 1986. The company blamed half of last year's fall
on the luxury tax introduced at the beginning of 1991.
The turnover of the Mercedes-Benz division rose by 13.7 per cent last year
to DM68bn from DM59.8bn a year earlier. Turnover of the car operations rose
to DM40bn from DM35.5bn, while commercial vehicles turnover rose to DM28bn
from DM24.3bn.
