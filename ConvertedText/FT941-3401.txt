FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps lift Scholes 84%


   By SIMON DAVIES


Scholes Group, the electrical installation equipment group, yesterday
announced an 84 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.3m to
Pounds 2.4m for the six months to December, despite a marginal increase in
UK sales.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 31.1m, but this was boosted by exports,
which increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 3.8m and now account for 12 per
cent of group sales.
Scholes' earnings growth was achieved primarily through further lowering of
the company's cost base, but also through some price increases in its major
business, manufacturing switchgear for the domestic housing market.
Operating profit margins increased from 5.5 per cent to 8.3 per cent at the
interim stage, and Mr Bill Riches, chairman, said he was confident further
operational streamlining could be achieved.
Mr Riches said: 'Management continues to focus on lowering the group's cost
structure and pursuing ways of enhancing manufacturing productivity.'
He said it would be tough for the company to achieve further price
increases, however, due to increasing competition from European
manufacturers prepared to buy market share at the expense of profit margins.
The company remains cash positive, and its net cash position increased by 37
per cent to Pounds 2.2m in December.
Scholes also announced that it had agreed to sell its 17 per cent stake in
Malaysian-listed PWE Industries.
The company will pay an interim dividend of 1.7p (1.6p). Earnings per share
increased from 2.4p to 4.3p.
