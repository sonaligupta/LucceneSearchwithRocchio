FT  21 OCT 92 / Slovakia delays Danube dam project


   By REUTER


   PRAGUE


THE Slovak government yesterday postponed for 'technical reasons' a project
to dam the Danube river and divert its water for the controversial Gabcikovo
hydroelectric power scheme, Reuter reports from Prague.
Damming was to have begun yesterday and, under the original schedule,
navigation of the river was to stop at midnight.
The postponement came amid a fierce row over the dam between Slovakia and
Hungary whose government says the project would pollute drinking water and
change the international border.
To try to defuse the dispute, Slovakia's environment minister, Mr Jozef
Zlocha, visited Brussels on Monday to seek European Community mediation. But
Mr Karel van Miert, environment commissioner, told him the Commission was
not ready to be a political mediator. He urged Mr Zlocha to avoid any
irreversible step to finish the dam.
The CSTK news agency quoted the government as saying new plans provided for
the river to be dammed by November 7. The director of Slovakia's state
navigation agency, Mr Karol Anda, told Reuter he had received no official
word.
The project, legacy of a 1977 pact between then-communist governments in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, has severely strained their relations.
