FT  20 APR 91 / Berlin building contracts for France, US


   By LESLIE COLITT


   BERLIN


FRENCH and US companies have won contracts worth more than DM1.4bn (Pounds
470m) to erect commercial and apartment buildings on a prime site in east
Berlin.
The awards, by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for privatising east
German companies, give a psychological lift to foreign companies seeking to
compete in east Germany against a massive west German presence.
The competition attracted 22 international investment groups. The final five
bids were examined by a jury of officials and architects.
Galeries Lafayette of Paris is to build a department store in the
Friedrichstrasse, centre of Berlin before 1945, and the French construction
company Bouygues will erect an adjoining office, shopping and residential
building by Pei, Cobb architects.
Tishman Speyer of New York, tackling its second big project in Germany after
a skyscraper in Frankfurt, will build on the remaining site.
The three companies agreed to raze a half-completed building which sprawls
over the three 18,000-sq metre properties and was begun in 1988 by the East
German Centrum department store chain. They will reimburse the previous
building costs of DM85m.
Construction is not expected to begin before late autumn; completion is set
for 1995.
