FT  22 OCT 92 / Alexandra Workwear swings back to black


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


ALEXANDRA WORKWEAR, a manufacturer and distributor of work clothes, returned
to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 672,000 in the first half,
against losses of Pounds 247,000 last time.
The swing was due largely to the absence of Pounds 1.5m in restructuring
costs taken as an exceptional item in 1991.
Operating profits for the 28 weeks to August 15 were 33 per cent lower at
Pounds 1.8m, on sales down from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 30.9m.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman since April, said trading profits had been hit by
the decision to freeze prices to maintain sales.
However, selected price rises had been introduced in the second half which
would add at least Pounds 2m to turnover next year.
The board was upbeat about the outlook for the current year, saying that
further gains would be made through debt repayments and price increases.
Trading continued to be difficult, however, with volumes remaining flat.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.8p. Earnings per share were 1.3p,
compared with losses of 0.5p.
Mr Dennis said the uncovered dividend had been maintained as 'a signal of
the confidence we feel about the way the business is going'.
The balance sheet had been strengthened, with debt down by Pounds 2.6m to
Pounds 13.5m and gearing reduced from 87 to 63 per cent.
The company aimed to have gearing down to between 40 and 50 per cent by the
year end.
Stocks had been reduced by 8 per cent to Pounds 15.2m. A further Pounds 2.5m
would be trimmed in the second half and Alexandra planned to cut stocks to
Pounds 10m by the end of next year.
The group's businesses in France and the Netherlands had about broken even
when taken together.
Alexandra, which claims more than 30 per cent of the UK market for workwear,
has suffered badly in the past two years under the burdens of capital
intensive restructuring and the sharp economic downturn.
In 1990, the group had recorded interim profits of Pounds 4.1m.
Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said that capital spending requirements
for the foreseeable future would be minimal.
'We must not look at that investment programme negatively,' he said.
'We have been able to maintain turnover because we could supply the services
we needed.'
