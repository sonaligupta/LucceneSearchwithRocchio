FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Rossmont drops at halftime


Rossmont, which came to the market in December, reported pre-tax profits
down 20 per cent to Pounds 60,000 in the half year to December 31, against
Pounds 75,000 last time.
Rossmont is the holding company for Santric, which supplies washroom and
hygiene equipment. Mr Robert Burns, chairman, said Santric was enjoying a
good year, though volume comparisons with the previous 12 months were
affected by a large project at Twickenham rugby stadium in the summer of
1992.
Earnings per share came to 0.4p (0.52p) and an interim dividend of 0.2p is
declared.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 892,000, but Mr Burns said the
value of order intake was showing the predicted second half improvement,
following the normal pattern.
