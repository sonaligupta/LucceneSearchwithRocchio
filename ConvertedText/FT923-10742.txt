FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Competition hits YRM and Aukett Associates


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


THE SHARE price of Aukett Associates yesterday fell from 9 1/2 p to 4p after
the architect announced that it had incurred a loss of Pounds 1.16m during
the six months to the end of March.
This compared with a profit of Pounds 740,000 during the corresponding
period last year.
The company said it would not be paying an interim dividend, against 1.25p.
YRM, another quoted architect, also saw its share price slip yesterday -
from 55p to 53p - after revealing a 31 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.37m over the year to the end of April.
Turnover fell by 16.9 per cent, from Pounds 23.6m to Pounds 19.6m.
The final dividend is cut to 2.35p (3.35p) making a total of 4p (5p),
covered 1.4 times by earnings per share, which fell from 9.35p to 5.78p.
YRM and Aukett both said increased competition for work in the recession-hit
UK construction market had led to a sharp reduction in fees, only partially
offset by increased earnings from continental Europe.
Aukett's turnover during the first half of its financial year fell by 36 per
cent to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 8.35m).
Mr Gerry Deighton, chairman, said fees had fallen faster than the company
could cut overheads, resulting in losses.
Aukett also made an exceptional provision of Pounds 788,000 to cover
redundancy costs and property write-downs, which increased the pre-tax
deficit.
At the operating level it made a loss of Pounds 369,000 (Pounds 770,000
profit).
Mr Deighton expected a return to operating profit for the final three months
of the financial year, although the company would make a loss for the year
overall as the effects of cutbacks and redundancies began to work through.
Losses per share at halfway were 7.31p (3.42p profit).
The group's most pressing problem is to reduce borrowings. Net debt of
Pounds 2.9m at the end of the previous financial year had risen to Pounds
3.2m - more than double shareholders funds of Pounds 1.25m.
Mr Richard Warner, finance director, stressed that the company was operating
within its loan covenants and had the full support of its bankers.
With gearing of only 9 per cent, YRM is in a much stronger position.
Mr Tim Poulson, chief executive, said that despite difficult trading
conditions in the UK the company had recently won some important
commissions.
By the end of the year it expected to be generating about 20 per cent of its
work in continental Europe, where it had established offices in Paris and
Berlin.
