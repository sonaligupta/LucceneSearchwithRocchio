   PORT MORESBY


Sir Michael Somare, Papua New Guinea's foreign minister, threatened
yesterday to redraw the resource-rich nation's mining agreements if his
party retains power after the June national elections, Reuter reports from
Port Moresby. 'It has been too long now that resource developers have been
taking PNG for a ride,' he said.
