FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Holderbank sees payout boost

HOLDERBANK Financiere Glaris, one of the world's largest cement producers,
expects its 1993 net profits to be 'on a par' with the 1992 level of SFr390m
(Dollars 264.85m).
Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman, also indicated that the dividend for 1993
should be sharply increased following the 54 per cent rise in profit last
year.
'The dividend certainly cannot remain at the previous level,' Mr Schmidheiny
said after the group's annual press conference. The directors have already
proposed that the dividend for 1992 be maintained at SFr12.50 per bearer
share.
Sales in the first quarter were up '1 or 2' per cent and profits were
stable.
Mr Schmidheiny said the economic environment this year would be even tougher
than that in 1992. 'Regions experiencing buoyant construction activity can
no longer expect impressive growth, and other areas are unlikely to see an
upswing.'
He expected a drop in demand in Europe and said the success of US operations
depended largely on whether the recovery continued.
Latin American markets, which contributed substantially to the jump in group
profits last year, were expected to produce 'further gratifying results'.
The group's total cement and clinker sales last year rose 12.2 per cent to
43.1m tonnes, with sales in Latin America rising 14.4 per cent to 10.3m
tonnes and European sales up 18 per cent to 13.3m tonnes.
Return on operating assets was strongest in Latin America at 19.7 per cent
followed by 9.9 per cent in Europe and only 0.4 per cent in North America.
Mr Schmidheiny forecast that the group's cement deliveries this year would
rise 4.4 per cent to 45m tonnes.
Mr Urs Bieri, a member of the executive committee, said Holderbank was
seeking to improve its market position in Asia, and was actively looking for
acquisitions in Vietnam, India and China.
