FT  28 JUL 92 / International Company News: Enichem heads bid for eastGerman
chemical business

THE Treuhand agency, which handles eastern German privatisations, said two
European groups are contending to take over one of east Germany's largest
chemicals operations.
A consortium led by Enichem, subsidiary of the Italian state energy concern,
and inc-luding Thyssen Handelsunion, a subsidiary of Thyssen, the German
industrial and trading group, and OMV, the Austrian state oil company, has
bid to buy polyolefine facilities at the Buna, Leuna and Bohlen sites. These
make up the heart of the east German chemicals industry. Polyolefine is a
feedstock for producing poly-ethylene and polypropylene.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, Treuhand spokesman, said the agency would sign
preliminary contracts with one of the bidders - the other group's name could
not be disclosed - by 1993. Investments of between DM2bn (Dollars 1.33bn)
and DM3bn would be needed to modernise the installations.
The deal would follow the recent contract won by a Franco-German consortium
of Elf Aquitaine, the oil company, and Thyssen to build a DM4.3bn refinery
at Leuna and to take over east Germany's Minol petrol station network.
Mr Wauschkuhn said Atochem, an Elf subsidiary, had bid to take over methanol
production at the Leuna site and was prepared to invest DM200m.
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, OMV and Beaulieu, the Belgian
carpet manufacturer, had bid to buy Leuna's facilities for producing
tensides for the detergent industry.
The Treuhand was also seeking to privatise production of ethylene epoxides
at Buna. Investments apart from polyolefine production were expected to
amount to DM1bn.
Investments of about DM13bn will be needed because of a pledge by Bonn to
retain the nearly 20,000 workers in the chemicals industry. It employed more
than 100,000 people in early 1990.
