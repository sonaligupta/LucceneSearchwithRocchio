FT  19 MAY 92 / Russia's bank chief faces call to resign

THE HEAD of Russia's central bank, Mr Georgy Matiukhin, was yesterday
accused of breaking the law and faces a call for his resignation.
Warning of 'financial collapse' because of soaring debts between
enterprises, Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the Russian parliamentary
budget committee and a member of its presidium, said he would demand Mr
Matiukhin's resignation during parliamentary hearings on the central bank
later this week or early next.
He said the bank had broken the law and terms of its charter by refusing to
produce a report on its activities due last Friday. It had also appointed
and dismissed board members without reference to parliament under whose
auspices it falls.
An investigation, related to the taking of bribes, was now in train.
However, Mr Pochinok said there was no confirm-ation of newspaper
allegations that credits had been advanced to members of the government or
parliament.
He said the central bank had followed the government's restrictive credit
policy too closely. This had resulted in an inter-enterprise debt of Rbs1.5
trillion (million million), and non-payment of wages by enterprises
amounting by May 1 to Rbs73bn.
There was now a severe danger of 'financial collapse' because of the
restrictions in credit.
Mr Matiukhin has been a political football in recent months - blamed by the
Russian government for adopting a loose credits policy, and now apparently
losing his previous parliamentary protection for being too tough.
Mr Pochinok said new candidates for chairman and board members were being
considered, but gave no names.
