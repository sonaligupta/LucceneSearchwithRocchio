FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: De Beers disappoints with 20%
fall


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


DE BEERS, the South African mining group which dominates the world's rough
(uncut) diamond market, announced yesterday a 20 per cent fall in 1991 net
attributable earnings, a result that slightly disappointed most analysts.
However, as expected, De Beers proposed a marginal increase in total
dividends, from 111.3 US cents per linked unit, to 112.1 cents.
Excluding the share of retained profits of associates, net attributable
profits were Dollars 763m or 201 cents per linked unit against Dollars 950m
or 250 cents.
Since March 1990 the group has split its operations into De Beers
Consolidated in South Africa and De Beers Centenary in Switzerland and
shareholders hold linked units.
Including the share of retained profits of associates, combined earnings
fell from Dollars 1.317bn or 347 cents to Dollars 1.078bn or 283 cents.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said it was encouraging that De Beers
sales of rough diamonds were down by only 6 per cent from the 1990 level and
'that the combined profits of De Beers/Centenary have held up as well as
they have'.
He would give no forecast for 1992 but said world diamond cutting centres
were in a sound financial position and retail diamond stocks were not
believed not to be high.
The combined diamond account at Dollars 803m, against the previous year's
figure of Dollars 911m, showed a 12 per cent decrease.
Analysts said diamond margins were squeezed from 21.9 per cent to 20.4 per
cent last year, indicating the tough conditions.
As part of its self-imposed role of stabilising the market, De Beers built
up its diamond stocks by Dollars 350m to Dollars 3.034bn.
Combined income from investments outside the diamond industry was lower at
Dollars 212m, against Dollars 227m, and interest income was Dollars 209m,
compared with Dollars 282m, reflecting lower cash balances. Prospecting and
research expenditure came to Dollars 116m, against a figure of Dollars 114m
and interest paid was higher at Dollars 67m compared with Dollars 36m.
Taxation absorbed an unchanged Dollars 254m, leaving a combined profit after
tax of Dollars 779m (Dollars 983m).
The combined share of retained profits of associates was Dollars 315m
against Dollars 367m, while the combined share of extraordinary losses of
associated companies - mainly De Beers' share of write-offs by Minorco was
amounted to Dollars 106m, against a profit of Dollars 112m.
