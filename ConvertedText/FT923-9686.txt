FT  04 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Italy


It is tempting to interpret yesterday's 5 per cent jump in Italian stock
prices as a sign the country's economic problems are on the mend after the
provisional agreement to abolish the scala mobile system of wage indexation.
But as so often the case in Italy, the story is more complicated than it
seems. The Amato government still has to win parliamentary approval for its
budget cuts. Even the wage indexation agreement will not be finalised until
the autumn.
To be sure, the agreement is a further indication of the government's
determination to stick to a tough line on the economy. It allowed the Bank
of Italy last night to reverse a half point of its recent 1.75 point rise in
interest rates. The bank must be satisfied that the deal will help shore up
the lira at least for the time being.
That will come as a relief to other European governments, which have been
worried that a weak lira could destabilise the entire ERM. But pressure
could resurface in September as the French referendum on Maastricht looms.
As for equities, yesterday's gain looks doubly suspicious since it occurred
on very low turnover. Italian shares still offer an earnings yield of little
more than 8 per cent, not much more than half the return on medium term
government bonds.
