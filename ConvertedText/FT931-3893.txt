FT  13 MAR 93 / Teachers told to boycott testing


MEMBERS of the NASUWT, the second-largest teachers' union, have been
instructed to boycott testing and assessment connected with the national
curriculum in England and Wales. This follows a ballot in which an
overwhelming majority voted for the action.
The action is unlikely to affect this year's tests, now under way, for
seven-year-olds, as the union has few members in primary schools. It could
disrupt the tests in the summer of 14-year-olds, including the introduction
of the controversial new English tests.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, last night said it was a sad decision
which would harm children's education.
The NUT, the largest teachers' union, is to ballot its members in May over a
boycott of the English tests.
