FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Higher prices lift Newmont


   By LAURIE MORSE


Fourth-quarter profits at Newmont Mining Corporation were lifted by higher
gold prices, rising production at its largest subsidiary, Newmont Gold, and
income from the start of gold mining operations in Peru, writes Laurie
Morse.
Income rose to Dollars 16.9m in the quarter, or 19 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 4m, or 3 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Sales for the quarter were Dollars 160.8m, up from Dollars 140.9m a year
ago. The company said the average gold price received during the quarter was
Dollars 388 per ounce, up from Dollars 362 per ounce in the fourth quarter
of 1992.
For the year, net income was Dollars 133.1m, or Dollars 1.71 a share, up
from Dollars 79m, or Dollars 1.13, the previous year. The 1993 results
include a tax benefit of Dollars 38.5m. Sales for the year were Dollars
634.3m, against Dollars 613.2m in 1992.
Newmont owns 38 per cent of the Minera Yanacocha gold mine in Peru, which
began gold production last August. During the fourth quarter, Newmont
received Dollars 4.2m in income from the Peruvian mine.
Newmont Gold Company, which is 90.1 per cent owned by Newmont Mining,
reported a 41 per cent rise in fourth-quarter income, to Dollars 23.9m, or
23 cents, on sales of Dollars 153.8m. This compares with income of Dollars
16.9m, or 16 cents, per share on sales of Dollars 128.4m.
During the quarter, the company sold 410,200 ounces of gold, compared to
with 378,700 a year ago.
