FT  21 APR 94 / Cambodian troops routed

Cambodian government troops have been pushed up to 8km away from the Khmer
Rouge headquarters at Pailin, which they first captured last month, in what
appears to have been a rout. Senior military officials in the nearby town of
Battambang said Pailin was again under the control of the guerrillas.
When government troops first marched into Pailin exactly a month ago, the
victory was presented as proof the Khmer Rouge had been fatally weakened.
Gen Pol Saroeun, who led the attack, said that if Pailin was lost again his
soldiers did not deserve to be called the national army.
The government is trying to present the defeat as a tactical withdrawal but
there is severe embarrassment over the reversal, with government soldiers
fleeing Khmer Rouge artillery attacks.
Wounded soldiers being treated at the hospital in Battambang said morale
among the troops was very low because they were short of food and were not
getting the medical supplies they needed.
The troops also complained that their officers were keeping everything they
found in Pailin for themselves and not sharing the spoils with their troops
as they had promised. So, when that attack came, there was little resistance
and many of the troops simply ran away.
The prime minister, Mr Hun Sen, angrily blamed the Thai military for helping
the Khmer Rouge. He claimed the Thais had provided artillery support and had
moved several hundred guerrillas along the border for the attack.
The Thais have consistently denied such allegations, which they regard as a
means of trying to conceal the incompetence of the Cambodian army.
