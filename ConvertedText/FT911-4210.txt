FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: The Week Ahead


ICI's first quarter pre-tax profits, reported on Thursday, will be far below
the Pounds 414m the chemical giant made in the first quarter of 1990. But
with the petrochemical margins rising temporarily in the first three months
of this year, the profits are unlikely to be as low as the Pounds 84m
recorded in the final quarter of 1990. The outcome is likely to be somewhere
in the Pounds 140m - Pounds 180m region.
Ratners Group, the jewellery chain which has been plagued by doubters since
it bought Kay Jewelers in the US, is due to report its annual results on
Monday.
The flamboyant Gerald Ratner is likely to provide a vibrant defence of the
company's long-term strategy in expanding in the US in spite of announcing a
slight fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 121m to Pounds 115m. But
unusually for Ratner, his comments will probably concentrate more on the
sober measures the company is taking to control costs than on the latest
jewellery craze.
A clutch of fashion retailers are also likely to show the effects of
difficult trading. On Wednesday, Laura Ashley, the fashion and furnishings
company, will report annual losses of up to Pounds 8m as it struggles to
combat its difficulties in its US operations.
Meanwhile fellow retailer, Etam, will produce only meagre profits of Pounds
6m although it is thought the company may have seen some more encouraging
trading this year.
