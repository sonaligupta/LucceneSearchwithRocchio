FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: De la Rosa resigns from Grupo
Torras


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


MR JAVIER De la Rosa, the enigmatic Catalan financier who masterminded a
Dollars 2bn industrial and property investment programme in Spain by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in the late 1980s, resigned last night as
deputy chairman of Grupo Torras, KIO's Spanish holding company.
Mr De La Rosa's decision appears to sever his links with KIO and leaves him
free to pursue an ambitious personal investment programme. Spanish
television reported last night, however, that senior KIO figures were hoping
to fly from London to Barcelona today to persuade him to stay with Torras.
KIO's intentions in Spain have not been clear since the end of the Gulf war,
and it has frequently been suggested the group might want to disinvest in
order to help pay for Kuwait's reconstruction. Whatever the case, Mr De la
Rosa's departure would be a massive blow should the Kuwaitis want to stay on
in Spain and, equally, would badly complicate an orderly retreat from Spain.
Torras owns controlling stakes in the biggest domestic chemicals group, and
Ercros, the country's largest foods group, Ebro.
Mr De la Rosa, though, has more recently been constructing his own empire.
He has 25 per cent of a successful local TV channel and last year bought
Spain's largest leasing company, CNL. He sold the leasing portfolio and
merged CNL with a leisure group, Tibidabo. Earlier this year he also bought
10 per cent of a profitable regional bank, Banco de Ibiza, which controls
half of a Catalan bank, Banca Catala.
More pointedly, he has been buying heavily into Ebro, and currently owns
around 20 per cent of the group.
He is also a large shareholder in Ercros and is seeking government
permission to sell control of its loss-making fertiliser and mining
divisions to Freeport MacMoRan of the US.
