FT  05 AUG 93 / Army called out in Srinagar

The Indian army was called out in Srinagar, Kashmir, yesterday, after
paramilitary troops failed to enforce a curfew for the fourth consecutive
day, following the killing of a seven-year-old boy and his parents by Border
Security Force personnel at the weekend, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Shops and offices remained closed as hundreds of Kashmiris took to the
streets defying the curfew to protest against the killing of the family at
point-blank range in their home in Daribal-Khanyar, in Srinagar. At least 20
people have died since Sunday night, in police firing to quell the
demonstrations, and over 50 people are injured and being treated in the
city's hospitals.
