FT  06 JUN 92 / UN team leaves Baghdad


   By REUTER


   BAGHDAD


UN inspectors left Baghdad yesterday after disabling part of Iraq's nuclear
capability but fearing it still had potential to develop a nuclear bomb,
Reuter reports from Baghdad.
The 25-man team, led by Greek expert Mr Dimitri Perricos, had already
announced it was taking with it Iraq's last stocks of highly-enriched but
unradiated uranium.
'Enrichment by electromagnetic isotope separation is out,' Mr Perricos said
in the Iraqi capital before leaving. 'The other side of enrichment by
centrifuge is still grey because we failed in our efforts to get the
procurement data from the Iraqis.'
The UN team spent nine days scouring Iraqi nuclear sites in a bid to resolve
doubts about Baghdad's nuclear programme.
Iraq refused to hand over data on companies and people who helped with its
nuclear programme, saying it was restricted by moral and other obligations
toward its contracting suppliers.
