FT  06 AUG 93 / World Trade News: US steel-makers want injury rulings
changed


   By NANCY DUNNE


US CARBON steel producers are citing a plunge in their shareslast week as an
argument for a rare reconsideration by the US International Trade Commission
of many of the steel cases which last week went against them.
The commission's findings shocked many who had expected injury findings, and
higher tariffs as a result, on most of the 72 complaints brought by the
industry.
In a new petition, submitted last Tuesday, the 12 largest steel producers
said 40 negative injury findings by the ITC, and the share sell-off which
followed, wiped out more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 671m) in their market
value. This had affected their ability to raise capital and maintain
investment needed to remain competitive in flat-rolled steel markets.
The six ITC commissioners, who will take a written vote on the petition,
have until Monday to submit their injury decisions formally to the Commerce
Department. The steel companies have asked them to reopen the case and 'to
issue an appropriate modification and correction' when they vote on Monday.
'Such a final vote will permit the commission to take proper note of the
devastating impact of continued unfair trade in carbon steel flat products
on the financial state of petitioners and their ability to raise necessary
investment capital,' the new petition says.
