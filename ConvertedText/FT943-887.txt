FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker declines to Pounds 3.15m


   By PETER PEARSE


Weaker furniture sales helped lead to a decline in pre-tax profits at
Cornwell Parker, the furniture and fabrics group best known for its Parker
Knoll chairs. In the year to July 31 profits fell from Pounds 4.61m to
Pounds 3.15m.
However, Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, said group trading profits in the
second half were 'significantly higher' than in the first. However, year on
year, they fell to Pounds 4.33m (Pounds 5.08m).
There was a Pounds 705,000 (nil) charge relating to further reorganisation
of Fardis, the French fabrics business.
Mr Jourdan said that tax increases earlier in the year had 'not obviously
damaged demand'. While he acknowledged that the recession was over, he
stressed that the feelgood factor was 'not yet with us. The middle classes
are just not buying.'
Operating profits of Pounds 3.66m (Pounds 5.21m) took in losses of Pounds
36,000 from Minty Design Furniture, against losses of Pounds 133,000 from
Lock, the now closed importer of antique furniture from Romania.
Group turnover was flat at Pounds 89.9m (Pounds 89.2m) including Pounds
598,000 from Minty (Pounds 1.18m from Lock).
Trading profits in the furniture division emerged at Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
3.6m) on sales lower at Pounds 48.4m (Pounds 50.6m).
Retail sales fell at Parker Knoll in spite of new product launches.
The fabrics division lifted profits by Pounds 676,000 to Pounds 2.2m on
sales up 7.5 per cent at Pounds 41.5m. About one third of those sales were
exported and the proportion is expected to rise.
The final dividend is unchanged at 4p for a maintained total of 5.7p, which
is uncovered by earnings of 4.6p (7.3p) per share. However, Mr Jourdan said
the payout was covered by the trading profit after tax, while the Fardis
restructuring costs would come in part from reserves.
