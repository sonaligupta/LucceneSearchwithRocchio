FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Revising standards for UK
managers - In a Nutshell


Senior management standards developed by the Management Charter Initiative
are to be adapted so that they can be applied to small and medium-sized
organisations.
The MCI, an independent body set up by employers and backed by the
government, seeks to improve the performance of UK managers.
Vlad Stanic, the MCI development director, said it was felt necessary to
apply draft senior management standards to the particular needs of smaller
organisations.
