FT  05 JUN 92 / Japan expects 3.5% annual growth rate

THE Japanese government expects the economy to grow at an average rate of
3.5 per cent annually over the next five years, according to drafts of a
long-term economic plan to be published this month.
The plan, prepared by the government's Economic Planning Agency, envisages
growth being led by domestic demand, including public and private spending
designed to improve the standard of living in Japan.
The expected contribution from domestic demand will be set at 3.75 per cent;
the net contribution from external demand will be negative.
This means that import growth will exceed export growth and that Japan's
trade surplus, bugbear of its relations with the US and Europe, will shrink.
Even though the plan has been drawn up in the middle of a sharp slowdown in
the Japanese economy, its conclusions are generally up-beat. It assumes that
Japan will pull out of the current downturn towards the end of the year.
The government is sticking to a forecast of 3.5 per cent growth for the
current financial year, which started in April, even though the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development expects to see a far slower rate
of growth.
The government was watching the effects of a package of economy-boosting
measures, announced two months ago, including a cut in the official discount
rate and the advancement of planned public investment from the second half
of the financial year to the first.
