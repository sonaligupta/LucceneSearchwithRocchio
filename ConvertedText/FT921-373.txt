FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: To the rescue - Ballot Box


Chris Patten, the tired-looking Tory chairman, may be safe in his marginal
seat of Bath after all. The Labour candidate, Pam Richards, social worker
and local councillor, is coming to his rescue.
Labour won only 5,507 votes last time, way behind the Tories and the Social
Democratic party who came within about 1,400 of Patten's vote. Richards,
however, is splitting the anti-Tory vote.
At a meeting for all seven candidates on Friday, Richards tore into
Conservative policies on health, education and the economy. Although the
audience had been carefully selected to provide rough balance between
supporters of rival parties, she was rewarded with a 20 second ovation at
the end, against only 10 seconds for Patten.
The real loser was Don Foster, the Liberal Democratic candidate, who said
Richards' vociferous support was due to the fact that she had given her
chief canvassers the evening off to allow them to cheer her on. Most Liberal
Democrat activists were hard at work knocking on doors.
