FT  23 NOV 92 / Observer: Off the rails


Is there anybody, anywhere, with a good word to say about the government's
plans for the privatisation of British Rail? This is the question posed by
Robert Adley, the train-spotting Tory who chairs the cross-party Commons
transport committee.
At a time when the government is looking for all good men to come to the aid
of the party, Adley has come steaming up the track with a declaration that
his committee, currently embroiled in an examination of rail privatisation,
has been unable to find a single independent witness prepared to stand
four-square behind the government's proposals.
Explaining his anxiety that the committee's report should be based on
evidence that reflects all shades of opinion, he implores anyone with a kind
word to say about privatisation to drop him a line so that their views can
be taken on board.
The outburst will come as no surprise at the Department of Transport where
Adley is as much a bete noire as Nicholas Winterton was to the Department of
Health. There are dark mutterings at the Transport Department that the
government whips were so busy ensuring that Winterton was booted off the
cross-party health committee that they failed to notice that Adley was
chugging to election as chairman of the transport committee.
The government's choice would have been Alan Haselhurst, a trusted
backbencher with a long-standing interest in transport, but such is the
distress at Adley's appointment (he memorably described rail privatisation
as a 'poll tax on wheels') that ministers would even have settled for Terry
Dicks, the right-wing Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, best known at
Westminster for his distrust of all things cultural.
