FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dofasco omits dividend after
posting CDollars 17m loss


   By BERNARD SIMON


DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has omitted its dividend for the first
time in recent memory.
The loss-making company, which was one of Canada's most profitable and
highly-regarded industrial groups before its ill-fated 1987 acquisition of
Algoma Steel, said that it would not pay the quarterly dividend of 15
Canadian cents, due on July 1.
The dividend stood at 32 cents a share in early 1991.
Dofasco's chief domestic rival, Stelco, suspended its dividend payments a
year ago.
Both companies have been hit hard by the slump in the North American motor
industry and by fierce competition from imports. The steelmakers have
received a modest boost since last November, however, from a decline in the
Canadian dollar.
Dofasco suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 17.6m (USDollars 14.7m) on
sales of CDollars 461m.
The company earlier wrote off its entire CDollars 700m investment in Algoma,
which emerged last month from a debt-restructuring with its employees
holding a sizeable equity interest.
Dofasco, which is based in Hamilton, Ontario, plans to cut its workforce by
1,000 jobs by the end of the year through an early retirement package and
the closure of its foundry operations.
