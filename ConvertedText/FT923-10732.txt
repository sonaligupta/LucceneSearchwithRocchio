FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Capita advances 28% to Pounds 1.77m


   By ANDREW BOLGER


CAPITA GROUP, which supplies computer and management services to the public
sector, said it was poised to benefit from the prime minister's declared
policy of subjecting more central government activities to the discipline of
the market.
The group reported a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 1.77m in pre-tax profits
for the six months to June 30 on turnover of Pounds 13.7m, a rise of 24 per
cent. About two thirds of the profits growth came from acquisitions, with
the rest organic.
Mr Rod Aldridge, chairman and chief executive, said the best performance
came from the facilities management division, which supplies computer,
managed and property services, but the consultancy and marketing services
divisions both showed a downturn in difficult trading conditions.
The facilities management division increased trading profits from Pounds
586,000 to Pounds 1.07m on turnover of Pounds 7.08m (Pounds 3.91m). At June
30 the division's forward projected income stood at Pounds 64m (Pounds 38m).
Mr Aldridge said Telecom Capita, its computer services subsidiary, had
invested heavily to become a market leader in providing computer services to
local government over the next 24 months.
The division's managed service companies secured 27 contracts for its
computerised revenue collection service. Capita has also become the first
company to take responsibility for managing the entire revenue function of a
local authority - East Cambridgeshire District Council. The group believes
this contract, worth Pounds 3.5m over five years, will be the first of many.
The consultancy division saw trading profits fall from Pounds 544,000 to
Pounds 466,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 4.93m). Capita Corporate
Finance performed strongly, advising on local authority buy-outs, and the
result of the election had further enhanced its prospects.
Management consultancy had performed below expectations, but Mr Aldridge
said he was confident a thriving business could be developed and the senior
management team would be strengthened following the recent appointment of a
new managing director.
Trading profits of the marketing division fell to Pounds 237,000 (Pounds
252,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 2.27m). The group said that
while the market continued to be rough, it had secured several new clients.
Capita had bank balances of Pounds 7.6m, despite outgoings of Pounds 1.6m on
acquisitions and capital expenditure. The group said its strong balance
sheet was a useful selling point with local authorities, since it provided
reassurance that it would be able to complete long-term contracts.
Earnings per share rose by 7 per cent to 7.6p. The interim dividend is
raised to 2.1p (1.8p) and a final dividend of 4.2p (3.6p) is forecast giving
a total for the year of 6.3p, a rise of 17 per cent.
