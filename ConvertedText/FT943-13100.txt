FT  21 JUL 94 / Fed chief sees moderate economic growth rate

   WASHINGTON


The US economy is settling into a pattern of more moderate growth, Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, said yesterday in his half-yearly
report to Congress.
The Fed forecast real GDP growth of 3-3.25 per cent over this year,
unchanged from its February forecast, and 2.5-2.75 next year. This compares
with growth at an annual rate of 7 per cent in the last quarter of 1993 and
3.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year.
'The favourable performance of the economy continued in the first half of
1994,' Mr Greenspan said in his generally upbeat prepared testimony to the
Senate banking committee. 'Economic growth was strong, unemployment fell
appreciably, and inflation remained subdued.'
Growth should continue at a moderate rate over the next six quarters while
inflation should remain subdued, provided 'appropriate' monetary policies
were pursued, he said.
Inflation is projected at 2.75-3 per cent this year, and little changed or
only slightly higher next year.
Accompanying those projections, however, Mr Greenspan gave a detailed
rationale for the Fed's succession of monetary tightening moves so far this
year and foreshadowed further possible rate rises should the inflation
picture show signs of deterioration.
'It is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to
head off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favourable trends in the
economy,' he said.
Reviewing possible danger signals on inflation, Mr Greenspan noted that
labour markets had tightened considerably in recent months, while costs of
commodities and materials had climbed, partly reflecting tighter capacity
utilisation. Improving economic conditions among the US's trading partners
should further boost demand, he said.
However, on the positive side wage rates had not shown 'persuasive' signs of
acceleration so far and consumer price rises excluding food and energy had
remained near last year's pace.
In such circumstances the Fed would maintain its vigilance over price
acceleration. 'An increase in inflation would come at considerable cost,' he
warned. 'We would lose hard-won ground in the fight against inflation
expectations - ground that would be difficult to recapture later. . . and
harsher actions would eventually be necessary to reverse the upsurge in
inflationary instabilities.'
Much of Mr Greenspan's testimony was devoted to recent market volatility.
The financial markets were not fully prepared for the Fed's shift from its
accommodative stance on interest rates in February, he acknowledged.
This lay behind the Fed's gradualist policy in raising rates. Nonetheless,
there was a sharp market reaction to the Fed's first  1/4 -point rate rise.
Evidence of unexpectedly strong economic growth in the US and abroad,
combined with the changing expectations of Fed moves, prompted sharp rises
in long-term interest rates over the first half.
On the recent dollar weakness, the Fed chairman said appropriate monetary
and economic policy would achieve the goals of solid economic growth and
price stability, and ensure that dollar-denominated assets remained
attractive to global investors.
Rising interest rates and financial market volatility did not seem to have
slowed overall credit flows this year, Mr Greenspan said. Domestic
non-fiancial sector debt had grown at an annual rate of 5.25 per cent up
till May, well within its 4-8 per cent monitoring range.
However, the composition of debt growth was changing, Mr Greenspan said.
Expansion of federal debt had slowed as a result of efforts to cut the
budget deficit. Business, household, state and local government debt had
been growing faster. This indicated that private borrowers had become less
cautious about taking on debt and lenders were more comfortable lending.
Nonetheless, the expansion of monetary aggregates remained subdued this
year. Looking ahead, the Fed's provisional forecasts for broad money growth
show M2 within a 1-5 per cent range for 1995, unchanged from this year, with
M3 within an unchanged 0-4 per cent range.
