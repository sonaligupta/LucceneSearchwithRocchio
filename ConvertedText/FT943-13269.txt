FT  20 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Freeport Leisure heads for market after
Pounds 4.6m buy


   By CAROLINE SOUTHEY


Freeport Leisure yesterday announced the purchase of Hornsea Freeport, the
factory outlet and leisure centre, for Pounds 4.6m from Peter Black, the
Marks and Spencer footwear, cosmetics and accessories supplier.
Factory outlet malls, common in the US but still rare in the UK, offer
customers deep discounts on branded goods which are typically over-runs,
cancelled orders, end of ranges or slight seconds.
Hornsea Freeport, established by Peter Black on the outskirts of Hornsea in
east Yorkshire three years ago, is occupied by 18 companies including
Aquascutum, Benetton, Damart and Laura Ashley. It also houses leisure
activities such as playgrounds, a model village and The Yorkshire Car
Collection. With a catchment area of 1m people within 90 minutes' travelling
time, the centre attracted 1.4m visitors last year.
Mr Sean Collidge, Freeport Leisure's managing director, said he believed
factory shopping was 'the only major growth area in retailing in the next
decade'. He anticipated the market could cope with 30 sites and that Hornsea
Freeport could manage six or seven sites over the next five years.
The Hornsea purchaser, a shell company which recently changed its name to
Freeport Leisure, will seek a stock exchange listing after the acquisition.
It will fund the deal by placing 7.2m shares and making an 8-for-1 rights
issue of 2m new shares at 65p a share.
The rights issue, which is not underwritten, will raise about Pounds 1.35m.
The proceeds of the placing and rights issue together are expected to total
some Pounds 5.5m after expenses. The company's market capitalisation will be
about Pounds 6.4m.
Peter Black has agreed to subscribe for 1.6m shares, giving it a 16.4 per
cent stake in the company. Mr Thomas Black, a director of Peter Black since
1971 and joint chairman since 1977, will become a non-executive chairman of
Freeport Leisure.
The funds raised will also be used to finance a second factory outlet centre
at a cost of Pounds 3m. Mr Collidge hoped the second facility in north-west
England would open next spring with a catchment area of 5m people within 90
minutes' travelling time. Two further sites were at an advanced stage of
planning.
Mr Collidge, who has a background in high street retailing, said he was
aware of opposition from some retailers who feared the deep discounts would
undercut their business. However, the concept of setting up malls some
distance from high streets allowed manufacturers to dispose of surplus and
other stock at a profit without significantly affecting traditional sales
channels.
Only 10 per cent of clothing in the UK is sold through discount outlets,
compared with almost 50 per cent in the US, and factory centres are likely
to narrow the gap. There are currently some 300 US factory malls with a
further 150 planned. Hornsea is one of only two in the UK but developers are
planning another 15.
For the year ended June 1993, Hornsea Freeport made pre-tax profits of
Pounds 267,000 (Pounds 45,000) on sales of Pounds 1.67m (Pounds 1.21m). In
the 10-month period to 9 April it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 332,000
on sales of Pounds 1.62m.
In February Peter Black reported a 22 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 5.73m to Pounds 7.01m. The distribution, leisure and
retail sector contributed Pounds 948,000 (Pounds 845,000) to profits despite
flat turnover of Pounds 7.4m (Pounds 7m).
