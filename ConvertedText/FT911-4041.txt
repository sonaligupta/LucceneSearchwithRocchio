FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Sage rights issue success


SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based computing services combine which is spending
Pounds 9.5m to buy DacEasy, a US-based accounting software company through a
combination of Pounds 3.5m cash and a 1-for-5 rights issue at 200p a share,
said that some 98.8 per cent of the shares had been taken up by existing
shareholders.
DacEasy's ultimate owner, the Insilco Corporation, recently filed for
protection under the provisions of the US bankruptcy code, but contrary to
our report on Friday DacEasy itself is not in loss. Last year it made a
Dollars 2.15m pre-tax profit on sales of Dollars 15.5m.
