FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom sells finance
arm

Northern Telecom has taken another step in its top-to-toe restructuring by
selling its US finance arm to GE Capital, the fast-growing US financial
services group controlled by General Electric.
Northern Telecom Finance Corp, based in Nashville, Tennessee, has a
receivables portfolio of USDollars 600m. Net proceeds from the sale will be
somewhat lower, although the company declined to give a precise figure.
Northern plans to use the proceeds mainly to reduce its long-term debt,
which stood at Dollars 1.51bn at the end of 1993.
The sale will not only relieve Northern of a peripheral and
increasingly-complex business, but also give it access to GE Capital's
financing muscle and expertise.
GE Capital has launched an ambitious expansion strategy in recent months,
ranging from a Dollars 2.2bn bid for Kemper, the Chicago-based financial and
mutual funds group, to the acquisition of Canada's biggest vehicle-leasing
company, and an Austrian computer finance business.
Its assets totalled Dollars 118bn at the end of 1993, and it has a strong
balance sheet, having been one of the most consistently profitable US
financial-service companies.
Northern has already raised more than Dollars 1bn from asset sales. In the
most recent, it sold the UK-based submarine cable business and a fibre-optic
manufacturing plant in Saskatchewan.
Mr Jean Monty, Northern's chief executive, said yesterday the sale of the
finance unit 'will accelerate our strategy to focus on our core business
strengths'. Further details of Northern's plans are likely to be outlined at
today's annual meeting in Toronto.
