FT  23 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US-Canada beer accord


   By BERNARD SIMON


   TORONTO


US and Canada are close to resolving a protracted dispute over barriers
imposed on each other's beer exports, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto.
An accord, already agreed between Ottawa and Washington, is in the process
of being cleared with Canada's 10 provincial governments, which control beer
and liquor distribution within their borders, according to an industry
source.
Last year the US slapped a Dollars 3-per-case duty on beer brewed in Ontario
in retaliation against Ontario's 10 cent-per-can 'environmental levy'.
Ontario and British Columbia have also imposed minimum prices on imported
beers, making them uncompetitive with domestic brands.
Under the draft agreement, the provinces will reduce their minimum prices
and lower a number of non-tariff barriers on imported beers. They will also
be barred from introducing any new discriminatory measures against US beer.
