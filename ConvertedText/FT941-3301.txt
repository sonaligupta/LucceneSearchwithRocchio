FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (30):
Most finance directors are dissatisfied with data management


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


Despite the widespread acceptance of information technology, more than half
of the finance directors in a recent poll of top companies are still
dissatisfied with the quality of their current information management.
This is one of the findings of a survey by the independent research group,
MRD, which targeted financial directors from 100 leading companies in the
UK.
While more than half the companies are now using their own internal IT
department's resources to develop their strategies for information
technology, only 13 per cent say they use an external IT resource.
Together, these companies represented an investment in IT of more than
Pounds 175m.
The survey, commissioned by European Software Publishing (ESP), says that 98
per cent of respondents felt that personal computers had made their work
more productive, but the time-factor - not 'technofear' - was seen as the
greatest restraint on the wider use of technology.
'Even though the technology is sitting on their desks, still relatively few
managers are using the communications and information-sharing capabilities
of information technology,' adds the report.
'Large amounts of their day are spent in communicating - meeting,
telephoning, and so on - with their workgroup colleagues, but few are fully
using technology to support and enhance these activities.'
