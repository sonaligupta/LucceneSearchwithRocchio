FT  12 MAR 92 / Election '92: Ashdown stresses need for 'coalition'


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday made his strongest
call yet for 'coalition' government, warning that Britain faced a 'crisis of
governability'.
His first election speech eschewed Labour and Tory attempts to focus on
health or the economy, echoing instead 1970s fears that the UK could become
ungovernable.
Rather than union or business domination, he said, the danger now was 'the
long-running failure of British democracy to modernise itself, and its
inability to produce governments that command national support'.
Neither Labour nor the Tories had a 'theme' to their campaigns and it was
'quite likely' that no party would have a majority after April 9, Mr Ashdown
said at a Commons press gallery lunch.
Liberal Democrat MPs were last night completing the party's manifesto,
expected to be launched on Monday or Tuesday. Still to be resolved was
whether the party would back the new 20p lower rate of tax - or propose a 1p
increase in the 25p basic rate to fund an extra Pounds 2bn education
spending.
Mr Ashdown hinted at the manifesto's theme, setting constitutional reform as
his priority. He argued that 'the ground for political reform has never been
so well-prepared'.
A hung parliament would mean 'that the other two minority parties - who
haven't since 1951 won more that 50 per cent of the vote in a general
election - have failed even to win a majority of seats under our rigged
electoral system'.
The Liberal Democrats expect most attention to focus on their conditions for
a coalition government.
So far, Mr Ashdown has set electoral reform, an agreed four-year programme
of government and ministerial posts for Liberal Democrat MPs as his demands
 -and he has shown no sign of softening his stance.
