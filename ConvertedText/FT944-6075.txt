FT  30 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Brazil gains 6.2%


Equities ended 6.2 per cent up in moderate trade on the Sao Paulo bourse
after domestic and foreign investors returned to the market and caused a
technical rebound from steep losses registered earlier in the month. The
Bovespa index gained 2,749 at 46,737, taking November's loss down to 2.6 per
cent from the 8.3 per cent seen at Monday's close.
Analysts said lower nominal interest rates combined with forecasts of
falling inflation in December improved the short term economic scenario,
encouraging investors to buy again. Brazil's central bank intervened in the
money market earlier, repurchasing securities in a forward operation for
settlement on December 5 at 5.45 per cent. Brazil's overnight call money
rate is 5.95 per cent. December inflation is seen as around 2.5 per cent.
Mexico
Stock prices ended stronger but off the day's best after a session marked by
optimistic bets on a smooth political transition this week, and a fall in
domestic interest rates. The IPC index closed 33.33 or 1.3 per cent higher
at 2,596.16.
