FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Gulf Canada halts dividends


   By BERNARD SIMON


OLYMPIA & York has lost a significant source of income with a decision by
its 75 per cent owned subsidiary, Gulf Canada Resources, to suspend common
share dividends.
Gulf paid a dividend of 40 cents a share last year, which translated into
payments of CDollars 46m (USDollars 38.3m) to O&Y.
Gulf continues to pay dividends, however, on its preferred shares. O&Y owns
62 per cent of the preferreds, and its income from this source was CDollars
34m in 1991.
The halt in common dividends is designed to help Gulf pay down debt and to
maintain investments in Russia, Indonesia and western Canada. The company
said yesterday that it was one of two western oil companies which Russia has
exempted from its oil export tax.
Gulf said removal of the tax allows it to step up production of the
KomiArcticOil joint venture in Siberia, in which it has a 25 per cent
interest.
In another move to generate cash, Gulf is buying the 55 per cent it does not
already own of Beaufinco Equipment, which operates an Arctic oil drilling
venture.
