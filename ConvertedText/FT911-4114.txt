FT  20 APR 91 / Letter: Government neglects health service at its own risk


   From Dr JP LEE-POTTER.


Sir, Public concern about the National Health Service is as high today as it
has ever been. Joe Rogaly ('The Tory tranquilliser', April 16) is not right
to say that 'worry about the NHS has steadily if gently declined'.
Only this week two polls have shown that health remains a big political
issue. A Mori poll in The Times on April 15 puts the health service in third
place behind the poll tax and unemployment in a list of public concerns. And
a Daily Express poll the following day, surveying voters in three
'barometer' constituencies, says that voters put health at the top of their
list of priorities for the government and that the majority felt the
government had harmed the NHS rather than helped it.
When this is put alongside the evidence that health was a key issue in the
recent Ribble Valley and Eastbourne by-elections, it becomes clear that the
NHS remains an important electoral concern among voters - one which the
government neglects at its peril.
Recent changes to the NHS are doing nothing to solve the problems facing
patients, due to years of chronic underfunding. Creating a new bureaucracy
to build up an internal health market will prove, I fear, to be an expensive
and unnecessary upheaval.
