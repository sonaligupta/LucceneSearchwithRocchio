FT  01 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Go-ahead expected for Western
Australian gas pipeline project

Participants in the ADollars 440m Goldfields Gas Transmission project in
Western Australia yesterday submitted final proposals to the state
government, amid indications from Mr Richard Court, the WA premier, that the
project will probably gain final ministerial approval in late-January.
The project involves building a 1,400km gas pipeline from Karratha, near
Port Hedland, through the Eastern Goldfields to Kalgoorlie. This would be
used to transport gas from the offshore fields to the mining area, and to
power projects en route. The participants in the venture are Western
Mining's Wesminco Oil subsidiary, Normandy Pipelines, which is part of
Normandy Poseidon, and BHP Minerals.
As part of the scheme, BHP plans to use a spur line to carry gas to a
newly-constructed power station that will supply its iron ore operations in
Newman. This would eliminate the need for an overhead electricity
transmission line from the Port Hedland power station to the WA town.
If the project gets the final go-ahead by end-January, it is anticipated
that the first gas deliveries should take place in the second half of 1996
to the Goldfields, with Newman coming on stream slightly earlier. Mr Colin
Barnett, the WA resource development minister, said that the pipeline was
expected to provide energy savings of anything from 15 to 50 per cent to
companies using the gas to power operations.
