FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement: National Savings to cut its returns


   By PHILIP COGGAN


NATIONAL SAVINGS cut returns on its products in response to the 1 percentage
point fall in base rates yesterday and withdrew its controversial First
Option Bond.
The bond, which was first issued in the summer, was specifically aimed at
basic rate taxpayers and offered attractive fixed rates for a year. It had
provoked complaints from building societies that depositors were withdrawing
savings to invest in the bond, putting pressure on society finances.
The government also withdrew its long-running 5th issue of index-linked
certificates, which offered a tax-free return of 4.5 per cent over inflation
if held for five years.
The new 6th issue will offer a return of 3.25 per cent above inflation.
Rates on other products were cut by between 1 and 1.5 percentage points.
