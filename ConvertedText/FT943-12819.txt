FT  22 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant recovers


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Price increases and strong demand for hire vehicles helped Goode Durrant,
the industrial holding company, to more than double profits before
exceptionals from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 9.6m for the year to April 30.
Turnover fell by 42 per cent to Pounds 101m, largely due to disposals. Sales
from continuing businesses rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 64.6m. At the
pre-tax level profits came out at Pounds 10.6m, against losses of Pounds
15.4m.
Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said the group's strategy of focusing on
the commercial vehicle and equipment hire business had been vindicated.
Since the year end, there had been signs of increased activity. Most
important, the equipment and storage hire businesses had pushed through rate
increases for the first time in many years.
As a result, the final dividend is increased by 17 per cent to 3.8p, for a
total 11 per cent higher at 6p (5.4p).
Northgate, the commercial vehicle rental group which contributes about 80
per cent of the group's pre-tax profit, had held 4 per cent price increases
last year. A further 4 per cent rise was introduced this year. Operating
profits in this division rose by 77 per cent to Pounds 11m.
Mr Waring said there was a trend among customers towards hiring a greater
proportion of their fleets.
Goode Durrant's equipment hire division increased operating profits by 90
per cent to Pounds 918,000 while the housebuilding division, which has been
pegged for disposal, held profits at Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 705,000).
Earnings were 14.5p, against losses of 31.2p. Excluding the Pounds 20m in
exceptional and non-recurring items taken in 1993, earnings rose from 5.8p
to 12.7p.
