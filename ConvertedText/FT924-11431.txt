FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bullers warns of receivership


Bullers, the maker of giftware and decorative accessories, is expected to
need further new finance next year and is in danger of going into
receivership.
The warnings came from directors as they reported pre-tax losses of Pounds
3.33m for the 18 months to June 30, compared with losses of Pounds 4.77m in
the previous 12 months. Turnover was Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 12.8m).
They said that if the loan from Gamlestaden were not converted into
convertible preference shares, which is planned under the arrangements
announced earlier this month, the company might not be able to continue
trading.
Even if the conversion went ahead the directors were unable to state that
there was sufficient working capital for the foreseeable future.
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis but they were qualified
by the auditors as this might not be a proper basis.
Losses per share came out at 4.8p (12.72p).
