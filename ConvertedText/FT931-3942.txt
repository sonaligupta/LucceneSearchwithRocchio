FT  12 MAR 93 / Pirate TV network for Poland


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


POLAND'S two state television channels yesterday faced a challenge from Mr
Nicola Grauso, a media baron from Sardinia, who revealed that the 12 pirate
Polish TV stations he controls were to form a network broadcasting
programmes and advertising in prime time.
The stations, which have operated independently until now, cover half the
country's 39m population and two thirds of its consumer spending power. Mr
Grauso, who owns a third of each station, said the programming would come
from RAI, the Italian state-owned broadcaster, as well as Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest company.
Mr Grauso owns the L'Unione Sarda newspaper in Sardinia and has invested
Dollars 15m in the Zycie Warszawy, a popular Warsaw daily newspaper. The
move steals a march on media conglomerates which have been waiting for the
enactment of a law ending the state radio and TV monopoly.
