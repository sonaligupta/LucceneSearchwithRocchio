FT  13 MAR 93 / Chinese vice-president dies


   By TONY WALKER


   BEIJING


General Wang Zhen, a hardline member of the Chinese leadership, died
yesterday, on the eve of the National People's Congress, or parliament,
which is expected to urge speedier economic liberalisation and further
entrench reformists in power, Tony Walker writes from Beijing.
Gen Wang, 84 and a veteran of the Communists' 'Long March', was vice
president, a largely ceremonial role. However, he remained active behind the
scenes, and until quite recently was opposing what he considered hasty
liberalisation.
