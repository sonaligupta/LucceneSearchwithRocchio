FT  04 AUG 92 / Observer: A labour safe seat


The speculation about the future of Norman Willis, the 59-year-old general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress, is bound to raise a few wry smiles.
While the current recession has seen a record number of trade unionists
losing their jobs, and quite a few company chairmen who failed to perform
have been forced to walk the plank, the job of running the TUC seems to have
been one of the safer occupations around.
Certainly, the TUC is conscious that it needs to improve its image as a
national institution. The Conservative and Labour parties and the CBI have
all changed their leaders recently and are hoping that some fresh young
faces will improve their public image. So why not the TUC?
Norman Willis has been doing his job since 1984 - longer than most company
chairmen. If he stays until retirement, he has another six years to go, and
will have done the job longer than any of his predecessors, save Walter
Citrine. However, even if Willis were to step down early, it is highly
unlikely that he would be replaced by anyone more exciting than another TUC
official, and on present form 45-year-old John Monks, the deputy general
secretary, is the favourite.
The idea that a woman might get the job - ex-print union boss Brenda Dean's
name has been mentioned - is rather exciting, but that is equally unlikely.
Ever since Citrine took the job in 1925, the general secretary has been
recruited from within the TUC.
Norman Willis himself was a relative newcomer. He spent his first 25 years
with the TGWU, the transport workers' union. However, he worked at the TUC
for a decade before getting the top job. Despite its well publicised
problems, it would be surprising if the TUC broke with tradition now.
