FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Slight upturn at Austrian
building materials group


   By IAN RODGER


   VIENNA


SALES and profits at Wienerberger Baustoffindustrie, the Austrian building
materials group, recovered modestly in in the first half. Losses in its
ferro-alloys and abrasives subsidiary continued to undermine a strong
performance in the core brick and roofing tile business.
Group pre-tax profits rose 6 per cent to Sch363.4m (Dollars 30m) on revenues
up 6.2 per cent to Sch5.9bn. Profits of the brick and tile division,
however, soared 93 per cent to Sch273m, on sales up 15.2 per cent to
Sch1.6bn.
Mr Erhard Schaschl, chairman, said new housebuilding activity in Austria and
Germany continued in spite of the general slump. Also, management had
concentrated successfully on improving profitability.
Restoring profitability to the Treibacher ferro-alloys business, which
suffered a loss of Sch166m last year, would take longer. World market prices
were being undermined by eastern European exports, and demand from the
aerospace industry was weak.
As a result of Treibacher's losses, Wienerberger last year suffered its
first profit decline in over a decade, with the pre-tax figure slumping 30
per cent to Sch626m.
Mr Schaschl said Treibacher was cutting costs and would break even next
year.
Sales at the pipe systems division were flat at Sch1.2bn. Profits were down
23 per cent to Sch34.5m.
