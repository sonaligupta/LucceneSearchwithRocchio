FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Board claims countered in Regina dispute


Mr Shiraz Malik-Noor, the major shareholder of Regina, who is pushing for
reinstatement on the board of the USM-quoted royal jelly company, has sent a
second letter to shareholders countering the accusations of the current
chairman.
Mr Malik-Noor is involved in a fight for control of Regina's board.
His opponents are Mr Paul Geoghegan, chairman, and Mr Tony Shakesby, finance
director. They have sent three letters urging shareholders to vote against
Mr Malik-Noor.
Mr Malik-Noor wrote that the decision to sponsor a costly US polo tournament
was made jointly with Mr Geoghegan and Mr Shakesby, who have criticised the
move as a waste of money. He also said that interest on loans to Regina by a
connected company was agreed in arms-length negotiations which did not
include himself.
The appointment of Mr Malik-Noor and two non-executive directors to the
board will be voted on at an extraordinary meeting on April 25.
