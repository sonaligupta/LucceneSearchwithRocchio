FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Filofax organises purchase of Lefax


Filofax Group, the USM-quoted personal organiser company, is buying Lefax
Group, which makes similar products, from Quarto Group for up to Pounds
1.2m.
Lefax sales are 10 per cent of those of Filofax but Mr Robin Field, Filofax
chief executive, said that its 'reputation for quality, innovation and
customer loyalty are second to none'.
The proceeds, which include repayment of intercompany balances, will be
invested in Quarto's core publishing activities.
