FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: SCA earnings slump by 96%

SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, experienced a sharp slump in
profits in the first eight months as adverse market conditions continued to
hamper the performance of its traditional forest industry products.
Earnings after financial items fell 96 per cent to SKr62m (Dollars 11m) from
SKr1.54bn a year earlier, as sales slid to SKr21.1bn from SKr22.2bn.
Restructuring inflated earnings in the first eight months of 1991 by
SKr501m.
Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA chief executive, said prices for sawn timber,
pulp, linerboard and paper were 'exceptionally low'. The impact was
exacerbated by Finland's November 1991 markka devaluation.
