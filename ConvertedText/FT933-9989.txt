FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Godspell - Theatre


   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY


When the 1971 rock musical Godspell was new here, I was too sophisticated to
go to see it. Now that my brow has dropped a bit, I have been looking
forward to catching up with a show that so moved many of my generation. But
you would have to have your brow around your ankles to take this revival
seriously. It is pointless, it is insincere, its Jesus story here is
virtually stripped of plot, and Jesus himself becomes (a) a joyless wimp and
(b) a pontificating creep.
And - worst crime in a musical - the songs are sold short. You hear
spirituals without spirit, soul anthems without soul, rock numbers without
rock. Music and text have been heftily revised. The show wants to recapture
the feeling of 1971, yet also wants to be tuned in to Now. (Someone even
says 'Fatted calf? Oh - Paul Gascoigne.') Everyone onstage is dressed in the
way-in Carnaby Street gear of pre-'71 fashion (the nastiest bellbottoms I've
seen in 20 years), but one of them makes a joke about wearing Reeboks.
The disciples keep re-telling Jesus's parables in various showbiz guises.
The Prodigal Son story is like a Crimebusters report; and the story of seed
cast upon stony, weedy, or fertile ground is re-told like an episode of
Blind Date. Usually these comic turns seem only to send up Jesus's original
stories. Yet at least they are lively, whereas Jesus himself is a drab. When
he explains to 'Cilla' that she has missed the point of Blind Date's seed
parable, you want the ground to swallow him up.
Cilla, as it happens, is imitated with happy panache by Gemma Craven, who is
also the only interesting singer in the cast of 12. As soon as she starts to
sing 'Day by Day,' you know that here is a properly supported voice,
individual in timbre, singing calmly and steadily, but with a simple
authority that actually sounds heartfelt. (Pity about her hairdo.) However,
the way the show wastes her talents is beyond belief. In both that number
and 'By My Side,' other voices soon drown hers.
The way that other singers have been encouraged to coarsen famous songs like
'Bless the Lord' and 'Turn Back, O Man' is dismal. Andy Crane (he of
children's TV) tries, not very hard, to be Jesus; and his singing is grey,
limp and often flat. In the Garden of Gethsemane, he asks 'What? Can none of
you stay awake one hour with me?' Answer: if we can, it's no thanks to you,
dear. James Gaddas (Judas) has more sheer presence, though no more
persuasiveness. In a largely speaking role, Mark Greenstreet displays rather
more force and sexiness than you might have believed from his work on
Trainer.
But no-one could really to be said to act, and some of the cute interplay
among the ensemble is embarrassing. Both the director, Lindsay Dolan, and
the musical director, Steve Brooker, do this show no service; but since
Stephen Schwartz, the original composer, has abetted them with new lyrics,
he must take blame too.
I wonder if even in 1971 the show honestly brought off its attempt to make
the Word of God go down like a rock concert. Several of its songs are
written for real singing; but I remain suspicious of all that 1960s
God-is-for-real-man. The most interesting feature is the photos of (oh yes)
Jeremy Irons in the original London staging. Because the casting and
dialogue have been adjusted to ingratiate an audience steeped in modern TV,
this Barbican revival will have some limited success. Nothing, however,
about the first-night ovation was spontaneous.
At the Barbican Hall until August 30
