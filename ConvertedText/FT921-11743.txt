FT  30 JAN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report


   By REUTER


London robusta coffee prices were sharply down by the close, while New York
arabicas had set life-of-contract lows for the fifth straight session at
midday. The London fall came as the continuing flow of gradings removed any
remaining concern over near-term supplies, dealers said. This was despite
the large total uncovered position in the dollar and sterlings contracts,
now expected to decline. 'We saw fund selling and liquidation today with
only light buying at the end on profit-taking ..We've closed very badly on
the charts - the only positive thing is that the market is now definitely
oversold,' one trader said. New York's March contract was falling early on
selling from funds, speculators and countries of origin. On the LME copper
closed steady as New York's Comex prices stalled near overhead targets.
However possible concern over Chilean supplies is expected to curb any
decline. Chile's senate has voted to allow state-owned Codelco to grant
private companies controlling stakes in joint-ventures, and unions are
threatening strike action. LME aluminium prices lost much of this week's
gains. Japanese selling took the three-month price down to Dollars 1,274 a
tonne in early trading.
