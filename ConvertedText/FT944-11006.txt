FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: USG wins court ruling on
asbestos claim

   NEW YORK


USG, the US manufacturer of building materials which is fighting a large
number of asbestos-related claims, has won a legal victory which could have
implications for the liability of insurers in asbestos cases, writes Richard
Waters in New York.
The decision, in the Illinois appeals court, upheld USG's contention that it
should be able to claim against insurance policies on a property from the
date that asbestos was first installed, not just from the date it was
discovered.
This so-called 'continuous trigger' test means the company can claim under
insurance policies issued between the late 1940s and 1984.
If applied to all outstanding property damage claims against the company
over asbestos, the decision could make available up to Dollars 600m of
insurance cover, USG said.
Eleven insurers are affected directly by the verdict, including Lloyd's of
London. A lawyer for Lloyd's said the decision would be appealed to the
Illinois supreme court.
While numerous asbestos-related property damage cases in the US are working
their way through the courts, personal injury claims arising from asbestos
were all covered by a global settlement reached earlier this year.
