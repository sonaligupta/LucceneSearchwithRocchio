FT  18 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Uncertainty dogs Polish market


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


Polish equity investors breathed a sigh of relief at the end of last week
when price falls slowed on the Warsaw bourse following the removal of 10 per
cent price limits in force since the exchange was established three years
ago, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw.
However, uncertainty remains as to what the market will do over the next two
sessions when prices remain free before the limits are reintroduced.
The first day of free trading brought a 6.7 per cent fall in the WIG index,
52 per cent down from the market's March 8 peak.
Mr Andrzej Skowronski, the head of Elektrim, a listed company which has seen
its market value shrink from 16,020bn zlotys to 8,580bn zlotys in the past
four weeks and was planning to raise some Dollars 50m through a forthcoming
rights issue to finance further purchases of state sector companies, said on
Friday it was too early to reassess Elektrim's strategy. 'But if we get less
money from the issue then we'll simply buy less plants,' he said.
