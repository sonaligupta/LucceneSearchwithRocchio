FT  07 JAN 94 / Financial advisers 'will not be penalised' over insurance


   By ALISON SMITH


Independent financial advisers who have tried and failed to find
professional indemnity insurance will not be penalised, their regulator said
yesterday.
The indication came from Mr Godfrey Jillings, chief executive of Fimbra  -
which regulates IFAs. It also emerged that many cannot help being in breach
of rules requiring them to have the cover because of insurers' concern about
possible compensation payments arising from pensions transfer business.
The insurance rule was introduced by Fimbra in mid-1991. The difficulties
follow a report on pensions transfers, commissioned by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and published last month. It
suggested that sales agents and advisers had not complied with regulators'
requirements in up to nine-tenths of the sale of about 500,000 pensions to
people transferring out of occupational pension schemes.
Mr Jillings yesterday met Mr Victor Knope of Bradstock Blunt & Thompson to
discuss concerns about the issue. The company acts as Fimbra's managing
broker for professional indemnity insurance. After the meeting, Fimbra said
that there were 'conflicting views in the marketplace' about the effect of
anxieties over pension transfers, and that it hoped the problem would be
resolved within the next few weeks.
In the meantime, IFAs which have found difficulty in renewing their
professional indemnity insurance will be allowed to trade without cover.
If an individual IFA is unable to meet claims upon it and goes into default,
the industry-financed Investors Compensation Scheme will act as a backstop.
