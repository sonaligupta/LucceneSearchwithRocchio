FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: EniChem seeks buyer for
detergent division


   By ANDREW HILL


Shares in EniChem Augusta, the Italian manufacturer of intermediate
chemicals for detergents, rose sharply on the Milan stock market yesterday
after its parent company announced it would sell its majority stake.
About 84.25 per cent of EniChem Augusta belongs, directly or indirectly, to
EniChem, the loss-making petrochemicals subsidiary of the state-owned Eni
energy and chemicals company.
EniChem announced on Tuesday that it had appointed Swiss Bank Corporation's
mergers and acquisitions arm to seek a buyer or buyers for its EniChem
Augusta stake.
Yesterday, there was lively activity in the few shares of EniChem Augusta
quoted in Milan, with the price rising from L2,820 to L3,178 at the close.
At that price, the sale could raise more than L300bn (Dollars 177m) for the
parent company, which is trying to cut debts of about L10,000bn.
Last week, EniChem Augusta reported a net profit of L24.9bn for 1993,
against L19.4bn in 1992, on turnover of L793bn, up 15 per cent.
