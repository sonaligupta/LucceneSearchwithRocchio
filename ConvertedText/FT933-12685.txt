FT  23 JUL 93 / Russia's budget threatens reforms


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


RUSSIA'S parliament yesterday approved a new 1993 budget with a soaring
deficit that could wreck government efforts to control the money supply and
750 per cent annual inflation, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The parliament, with a free-spending reputation and packed with deputies
opposed to President Boris Yeltsin's reforms, relaxed the purse strings with
projected spending of Rbs44,700bn (Pounds 30bn).
This dwarfed expected revenues of Rbs22,300bn and will produce a deficit of
Rbs22,400bn, up from an earlier Rbs8,500bn target.
Parliament also passed a new law placing the central bank firmly under its
control.
