FT  23 APR 93 / People: Clean sweep at Invesco MIM


At least half a dozen senior executives of Invesco MIM, including the
finance director, have resigned as part of a wideranging reorganisation
designed to restore the image of the troubled fund manager.
In an unexpected decision, Ratan Engineer, finance director since 1989, is
to leave. A number of other staff below board level on the compliance and
legal side, as well as two fund managers, are also departing.
Charles Brady, who has recently assumed the title of executive chairman, is
attempting to improve the image of the group which has been affected by
episodes including the Maxwell affair.
He is working closely with the new head of European operations, Norman
Riddell.
In January, Bob Wilkinson, former head of surveillance at the London Stock
Exchange, was hired as a consultant to Brady, with a brief to improve group
compliance procedures.
Wilkinson is also reporting to Imro, the pension fund management regulatory
organisation, which has been conducting a long-running investigation into
Invesco's compliance affairs.
The Imro inquiry is likely to be concluded in the next month or so.
There have been redundancies connected with the recent loss of Drayton Asia
investment trust to a rival group EFM Dragon.
