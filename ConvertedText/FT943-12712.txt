FT  23 JUL 94 / Swans bidder to meet Rifkind


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, defence
procurement minister, will on Tuesday meet the head of Soffia, the parent of
the French-based company CMN, which is the sole prospective buyer for
Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, Chris Tighe writes.
CMN has said it will only buy the yard if the government guarantees two
years' base workload. Swans' present work finishes in November.
An offer to Swans by the Ministry of Defence of the Pounds 6m refit of the
tanker Olwen depends on the yard finding a buyer and ending its receivership
by August 1.
