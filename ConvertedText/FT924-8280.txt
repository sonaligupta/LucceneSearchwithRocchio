FT  12 NOV 92 / Survey of Jordan (10): Exporters look further east - James
Whittington notes problems in the phosphate trade


   By JAMES WHITTINGTON


THOUGH phosphate exports have fallen by 33 per cent in the past three years,
slashing Jordan Phosphate Mines Company (JPMC) profits from a record 109m
Jordanian dinars in 1989 to just JD33.1m in 1991, the company is still the
world's third biggest phosphate exporter. 'Phosphate remains the oil of
Jordan,' says Mr Thabet Taher, the state-run JPMC's newly-appointed general
manager.
The boon to JPMC offered by Jordan's 45 per cent devaluation in 1989 was
shortlived as the company's traditional eastern European markets collapsed.
In the late 1980s, eastern European countries bought more than 30 per cent
of Jordan's phosphate exports. But these countries' shortage of hard
currency, combined with ambiguity in some of them over who actually owned
previously state-run phosphate processing plants, cut Jordan's exports in
1991 to 0.58m tonnes, from 2.3m tonnes in 1989.
To make matters worse, this decline coincided with the Gulf crisis and the
disruption caused by United Nations-backed inspections of all vessels
entering Jordan's only port, Aqaba.
These factors contributed to a fall in the company's total phosphate exports
to 4.2m tonnes in 1991 from 6.4m tonnes in 1989. And this year shows little
sign of improvement. Just 3.12m tonnes have been shipped in the first nine
months of 1992.
However, the downward trend is by no means unique to J o r d a n. The
International Fertiliser Industry Association (IFA) reports that world
phosphate exports fell by 29 per cent between 1989 and 1991 and the group
forecasts that no substantial recovery is likely before the end of the
century.
The JPMC's response to the prospect of tighter markets has been to shift
trade towards Asia and develop a strategy to raise production of
phosphate-based fertilisers in co-operation with its trading partners.
Contracts with India, for example, have partly replaced already the void
left by eastern Europe. Last year Jordan shipped 1.3m tonnes of phosphate to
India and contracts for 1.6m tonnes have been signed for 1992 - making it
the biggest importer of Jordanian phosphate.
Towards the end of 1991, JPMC signed a Dollars 100m joint venture with
India's Southern Petrochemicals Corporation to produce an annual 200,000
tonnes of phosphoric acid for the Indian market. A new processing plant,
which will be 60 per cent owned by the Indian company and 40 per cent by
JPMC, will be opened in 1995 at Shideya, southern Jordan.
This site, the most recent of the JPMC's three mines, started operations in
1988 and has 790m tonnes of confirmed quality phosphate reserves - some 83
per cent of Jordan's total known reserves.
A similar deal was finalised earlier this year with a Mitsubishi-led
consortium of four Japanese companies which will take a 60 per cent share in
a Dollars 360m compound fertiliser plant, also planned to open in 1995, with
JPMC and the Jordan-based Arab Potash Company (APC) each taking a 20 per
cent share.
Mr Taher sees the future lying in such joint ventures. 'Countries now prefer
to import finished products rather than raw phosphate,' he says. 'It is
cheaper and less damaging to their environment.'
Mr Kazuhiko Sakishima, general manager of the Mitsubishi Corporation's Amman
branch and liaison officer between JPMC and the Japanese consortium, says
that the plant to be built in Aqaba will produce 300,000 tonnes of
fertiliser for Japan, or about 10 per cent of its entire consumption.
Both joint ventures will be built on 'duty-free' zones in Jordan, which
offer investors tax exemption on profits, exemption from duty on imported
machinery and a holiday from income of property tax for up to 12 years.
APC, which is Jordan's second biggest exporter, has meanwhile emerged
largely unaffected by the geopolitical shocks of the past three years and
saw sales rise to Dollars 150m in 1991 from Dollars 130m the previous year.
Miss Miranda Batshon, APC's marketing manager, says the company has profited
from a rise in demand from its Far Eastern markets, particularly China,
which raised its demand last year for Jordanian potash by 47 per cent.
As well as holding a 20 per cent share in the Jordan- Japanese fertiliser
plant in Aqaba, APC has begun a two-phase plan to raise annual production to
2.2m tonnes from the present 1.4m tonnes a year by the end of the century.
Mr Taher says Jordan's phosphates production will rise to 9.6m tonnes by
2000.
