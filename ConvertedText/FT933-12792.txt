FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Reduced finance charges help Aim improve to
Pounds 3.6m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PRE-TAX profits at Aim Group, the maker of aircraft interior fittings,
improved from Pounds 3.11m to Pounds 3.63m in the year to April 30, but the
rise was entirely attributable to reduced finance charges.
Operating profit declined to Pounds 4.01m (Pounds 4.43m) as margins were
eroded in a difficult market with aircraft cancellations and postponements.
Mr Jeff Smith, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Under the circumstances
we were pleased it was such a small decrease.'
Finance charges fell to Pounds 378,000 (Pounds 1.32m) on the back of the
disposal in May last year of the contracting division. The sale realised
Pounds 2.7m net cash including the release of some bank debt.
Turnover fell to Pounds 41.7m. Total sales in the previous period were
Pounds 58m, including Pounds 15m from contracting.
Aim completed one refurbishment order for the VC10 within the first two
months of its year and only started another, for the SAAB 2000, this spring.
Mr Smith said: 'At the end of the day, more and more people are flying and
you clearly can't fly without aircraft. Quite what the timing of any upturn
will be is obviously a question of opinion and debate. My view is 1995 but I
could be wrong.'
The company did not adopt the new FRS 3 accounting standard. Mr Smith said
he thought the standard would have been 'confusing'. Under the new rules a
Pounds 181,000 one-off gain on the disposal of the contracting division
would have been included in pre-tax profits instead of being taken below the
line.
Mr Smith said: 'I am quite happy with criticism if it comes. Given the
timetable of the disposal it makes a great deal more sense to do it this
way.'
A recommended final dividend of 6p brings the total for the year to 7.5p
(6.5p). Earnings per share improved to 16.6p (13.7p).
