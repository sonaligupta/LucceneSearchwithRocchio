Germany's second largest insurance group, will report unconsolidated
results. The company made a net profit of DM73.25m (Dollars 42.8m) in 1992
but the outlook for most of the AMB divisions is 'not good'. The share price
has risen 62 per cent since early last year to DM1,215 but one analyst said
this was 'purely speculative'.
