FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Harland workers in dispute laid off


   By Our Belfast Correspondent


MORE THAN 500 workers at Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder, went on
strike yesterday in one of the most serious outbreaks of industrial unrest
since the company was privatised nearly three years ago.
The dispute, prompted by the company's decision to lay off four outfitters
for supporting an overtime ban, escalated as pickets manned the yard's main
gates in east Belfast.
Mr Jack Nicholl, an official of the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union,
said the workers were demanding the reinstatement of the outfitters in talks
with the management aimed at resolving the dispute.
The management said the dispute with the outfitters was caused by the
refusal of some of them to work night shifts earlier this week.
The outfitters, including plumbers and electricians, have been in dispute
with the company for a year over a qualifications payment which led to the
union imposing the overtime ban.
Harland has an order book filled until the end of 1994.
