FT  21 JUL 94 / Fighting flares in south Russia

Fighting erupted in the breakaway southern Russian region of Chechnya
yesterday after opposition forces blew up a highway bridge leading into the
capital, Interfax news agency reported. The battle pitted gunmen loyal to
President Dzhokar Dudayev against fighters loyal to opposition leader Ruslan
Labazanov. A clash between the same two groups last month claimed at least
140 lives, including those of nearly 100 non-combatants, Interfax said. Also
killed in the June fighting was Mr Labazanov's brother. According to
Interfax, the opposition leader has sworn to avenge his brother's death.
Chechnya is famed for its gun-toting clans and has a long history of blood
feuds and revenge killings. It has severed most economic ties with Russia,
and the resulting lawlessness and economic hardship have helped swell
opposition ranks. Mr Dudayev, a former Soviet air force general, was elected
president of Chechnya in 1991 and immediately declared the independence of
the tiny, mountainous region in southern Russia. Since then, the opposition
has repeatedly tried to topple him.
