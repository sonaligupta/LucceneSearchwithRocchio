FT  24 AUG 92 / AEEU may face split affiliation


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


THE AEEU engineering and electrical union could have one section in the
Trade Union Congress and one section outside, according to a confidential
report for today's meeting of the TUC's finance and general purposes
committee.
The committee will discuss the dispute over the re-admission of the former
EETPU electricians' union via a merger with the former AEU engineering
union. The dispute over the electricians, expelled in 1988 for refusing to
obey TUC rulings, will also feature at next month's trade union congress.
Both sections of the AEEU will vote in April on whether to remain in the
TUC, in the case of the engineers, or rejoin in the case of the
electricians. A clear majority for TUC membership is expected.
Several unions want to place conditions on the return of the electricians,
including the giving up of members belonging to break-away groups from the
National Union of Journalists, the Fire Brigades Union and the Prison
Officers Association.
If those conditions prove too onerous for the electricians it seems it could
remain in the AEEU but outside the TUC. The TUC's legal adviser has said
that the two sections remain sufficiently independent to affiliate
separately.
Meanwhile, the TUC today publishes the final agenda for this year's congress
and the general council's report.
The report stresses that the TUC must focus its operations from the current
17 priorities to just six. The two most immediate are a campaign for full
employment and the establishment of an employee's charter laying down a set
of minimum rights at work.
