FT  19 MAY 92 / International Company News: Taiyo Fishery reduces deficit


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


TAIYO Fishery, the Japanese fishing company attempting to transform itself
into a general food producer, reported a pre-tax loss of Y3.6bn (Dollars
27.6m) for the year to the end of March, reduced from a Y6.1bn loss in
fiscal 1990.
The company said streamlining its trawler operations led to a 3 per cent
fall in sales to Y525.9bn, but the success of its restructuring programme
would create a pre-tax profit of Y1bn in the current year on sales virtually
unchanged at Y526bn.
Mainline fish products fell from 57.1 per cent to 54.1 per cent of total
sales, but sales from other types of processed foods rose from 8 per cent to
only 9.4 per cent of the total, reflecting tough competition in the Japanese
food industry.
The company said the downturn in the Japanese economy had affected sales,
although consumer demand for daily goods, including fresh and processed
foods, had remained healthy, with a 4.8 per cent increase in chain store
sales last year.
Taiyo said capital spending for the current year would fall to Y4.1bn from
Y5.3bn, and the company revised forecasts for consolidated returns, with a
pre-tax loss now expected to be Y2.6bn, up from Y1.5bn.
