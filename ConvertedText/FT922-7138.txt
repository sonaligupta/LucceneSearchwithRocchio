FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Decline in demand hits results
at Kyocera


   By NEIL WEINBERG


KYOCERA, the world's top maker of integrated circuit ceramic packages,
unveiled an 11.1 per cent fall to Y58bn (Dollars 436.1m) in consolidated
pre-tax profits for the year ended March.
The company was hit by slack demand for semi-conductor components, the yen's
gains against the dollar, and high research and development costs.
Non-consolidated profits were off by a steeper 26.7 per cent to Y41.1bn,
marking the first decline in five years. Net profits for the group,
meanwhile, fell 15.9 per cent to Y27.1bn, and 21.1 per cent to Y23.3bn for
the parent company.
Consolidated sales were off 1.7 per cent to Y453bn. At the parent company,
they were down 4.2 per cent to Y317bn.
The group's ceramic product sales increased 1.7 per cent to Y340bn, but
electronic equipment sales fell 15.9 per cent to Y66.3bn, on a sharp drop in
foreign demand for computer equipment and laser printers. Optical precision
equipment was also off, 1.8 per cent to Y47.2bn.
Consolidated domestic sales slipped 3.7 per cent to Y339bn. In contrast,
they gained 1.5 per cent to Y121.6bn in the US, 6.5 per cent to Y76bn in
Europe and 14.1 per cent to Y49bn in other areas.
The company also cut long-term liabilities 68 per cent, to Y18.8bn, on a
consolidated basis, and 86 per cent to Y6bn on a parent basis, largely by
reducing the level of corporate bonds outstanding.
For the year to March 1993, Kyocera expects non-consolidated sales to rise 5
per cent to Y333bn, and pre-tax profits 6.8 per cent to Y43.9bn. The gains
are based on expectations of revived demand at home and in the US.
