FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: South China Morning Post gains
9% on year


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


SOUTH China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading
English-language newspaper, yesterday reported a 9.3 per cent rise in
profits to HKDollars 531.7m (USDollars 68.8m) from HKDollars 486.4m in the
year to June 30, writes Simon Holberton.
Profits for the company, which is 51 per cent owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation, were struck on a 14 per cent growth in turnover to
HKDollars 921.6m from HKDollars 807.5m.
Directors recommended a final dividend of 13 cents a share  - up 15 per cent
on a year ago  - which, with the 17 cents paid at the interim stage makes 30
cents for the year.
South China Morning Post also publishes magazines and books. Last December
it paid HKDollars 30m for Wah Kiu Yat Po, a Chinese language daily paper.
Far East Consortium International, a Hong Kong property development and
flour mill group, said final profit jumped 31 per cent in the year to March
31 to HKDollars 161m, in spite of a modest fall in turnover.
Turnover was down to HKDollars 364m from HKDollars 393m, a 7.4 per cent
fall. The final dividend was an unchanged 8 cents.
