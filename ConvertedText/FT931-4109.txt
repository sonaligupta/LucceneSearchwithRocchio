FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: A second skin for astronauts - Worth Watching


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


The skin-tight synthetic laminates worn by today's athletes could point the
way to space suits which fit like a second skin.
Researchers at United Technologies Corporation, of Hartford, Connecticut,
are devising materials to make much lighter clothing for astronauts.
Membrane films are available which separate gases, necessary to remove
carbon dioxide.
By the next century fabrics could be made from a genetically- engineered
protein which would contract like muscle and apply constant, life-protecting
pressure on the body. United Technologies: US, 203 728 7000.
