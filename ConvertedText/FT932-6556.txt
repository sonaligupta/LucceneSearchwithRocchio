FT  27 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Courtaulds surges


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN


Relief that no rights issue arrived with the figures helped Courtaulds, the
chemicals group, to put on a sprightly performance yesterday. The shares
received added support from a merger announcement and jumped 19 to 541p.
The cash call rumour, which dominated trading in the stock on Tuesday,
apparently sprang from comments by the company before it went in to closed
season that the debt would hit Pounds 400m. Marketmakers who took the
speculation seriously had gone short of the shares. When they realised
Courtaulds had been over-cautious and the debt was only Pounds 220m there
was a scramble for stock.
The buying pressure was increased by an acceptable profit of Pounds 192.7m,
a comforting statement and news that Courtaulds is to merge its acrylics and
viscose division with Hoechst, of Germany, providing a competitive advantage
in a very tight area of the industry.
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, advanced 18 to 669p after the
company's announcement of an enhanced scrip dividend and an early 1993
interim dividend payment of 13.5p per share.
Analysts said the shares also received support from BZW and UBS, but in the
afternoon Lehman Brothers cut its 1994 forecast by Pounds 39m to Pounds 966m
on the back of low copper price estimates. The house also pared its earnings
per share estimate by 9p to 51p.
A one-for-one share split for BAT Industries resulted in the stock closing 2
1/2 up at 419p in the new form. Very high turnover of 39m shares was linked
to the company's enhanced scrip scheme offering shares in place of cash
dividends.
Guinness shares reacted badly to comments made at the group's agm, closing 7
off at 460p. Drinks specialists said the warning of lower 1993 first-half
profits was largely known.
BP moved up 5 1/2 to 312p on news of a Pounds 250m management buyout of one
of the company's consumer products divisions and a good performance by oils
in the US overnight. Shell rose 4 to 614p.
A buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson drove Lasmo 5 higher to 151p. The
broker rated the stock a 'short-term trading buy', citing short-term US
interest as likely to increase in the run-up to the full ADR listing
expected next month. Kleinwort also highlighted the group's drilling
operations in Colombia, adjacent to BP's Cusiana oil discovery, as likely to
heighten US interest in the shares.
Clyde Petroleum, up 3 more at 54p, continued to attract heavy two-way
activity, with big institutions said to be chasing the stock as a number of
important drilling operations get under way. Clyde's current and future
operations include drilling in Syria, Malaysia and the Yemen.
After lagging behind BT and Cable and Wireless for the past two sessions,
Vodafone raced ahead 8 1/2 to 427 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 5.8m, boosted
by strong US buying.
A buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson ahead of today's annual meeting
boosted international trading group Inchcape. The shares jumped 16 to 576p
with volume reaching 2.3m. Williams Holdings bounced 4 to 314p after NatWest
Securities urged investors to buy.
US buyers were active in Tiphook, the shares rising 12 to 311p. APV put on 4
at 97p, with SG Warburg said to have been positive.
News from Rolls-Royce that it expects little improvement in trading
conditions over the next two years dented sentiment in the aerospace sector.
The stock, sustained by bargain hunters, eased only a penny to 144p on 7m
turnover.
Sentiment from Rolls-Royce weakened Smiths Industries, 3 lighter at 342p,
and FR Group, which shed 4 to 258p.
British Aerospace fell on the Rolls-Royce statement but recovered to close
unchanged at 325p. The Pounds 57.6m that BAe said it was repaying for the
illegal government aid it received for its 1988 purchase of Rover was not as
high as feared.
Pilkington eased a penny to 133p on turnover of 3.4m shares on worries of
more troubling news following recent high-level suspensions at the company's
US arm.
The resignation of Mr James Tyrrell as finance director of Abbey National
and his appointment as group finance director at London International Group
saw Abbey dip 3 to 415p and LIG add 5 at 186p.
Reckitt & Colman was squeezed 16 higher to 558p on slim turnover. Paterson
Zochonis, the branded soap manufacturer, rose 13 apiece in the 'A' stock to
398p and in the ordinary to 448p after a small agency cross in the 'A'
shares to 397p.
