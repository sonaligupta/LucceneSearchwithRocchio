FT  26 MAY 93 / Cambodia poll 'free and fair'

THE HEAD of the United Nations mission said yesterday Cambodia's election
had been 'free and fair' and people had been able to vote for the candidates
they wanted in spite of intimidation by authorities, AP reports from Siem
Reap.
No significant incidents were reported on the third day of the UN-organised
six-day balloting, Cambodia's first multiparty election since 1972.
'This election has not been held in an ideal situation but, nevertheless, it
has met the yardstick for a realistic standard for free and fair elections,'
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN peacekeeping chief, told reporters during a tour
of polling stations in north-western Cambodia.
More than 85 per cent of Cambodia's 4.76m registered voters have already
cast their ballots, Mr Eric Falt, a UN spokesman, said.
Mr Akashi said he could not understand why the Khmer Rouge had not done more
to disrupt the poll. 'Their minds are unfathomable,' he said. In a surprise
move, some Khmer Rouge leaders let guerrillas and villagers vote on Monday
in the areas they control in spite of earlier threats to disrupt balloting.
