FT  26 OCT 92 / Observer: Retiring


Buccaneering Italian businessman Raul Gardini will have to search the seven
seas for a new sponsor for his yachting ambitions - unless his Ferruzzi
heiress wife chips in the Pounds 232.6m she pocketed last year on his
'divorce' from the Ferruzzi-Montedison agro-industrial group.
Since his Montedison-sponsored America's Cup yacht Il Moro di Venezia was
pipped at the post by millionaire Bill Koch, Gardini has stayed bubbling on
the surface of Italian business with takeovers of well-known mineral water
brands. But although 'Sir Raul' would like to recoup his hero status by
sailing for the cup again, Montedison has mutinied.
On top of the Pounds 61m it sunk into his previous attempt, the group lost
approaching Pounds 87m in its first half and has decided to pull the plug on
its much publicised but ruinously expensive sponsoring of sports.
Another of them to be ditched is basketball, the passion of Gardini's
22-year old son Ivan, who was briefly chairman of Ferruzzi's main holding
company.
