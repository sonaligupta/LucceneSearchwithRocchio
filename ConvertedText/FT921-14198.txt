FT  17 JAN 92 / Inner-city aid package announced


   By RICHARD EVANS


SOME OF the country's most deprived inner-city areas are to be helped by an
urban aid package announced by the government yesterday.
Initial allocations for 1992-93 to 57 urban programme authorities amount to
Pounds 248m.
The biggest allocations go to Birmingham (Pounds 22.5m), Manchester/Salford
(Pounds 20.8m), Liverpool (Pounds 18.2m), and Newcastle/Gateshead (Pounds
16.2m).
Smaller amounts go to Islington and Lambeth in London (Pounds 8.5m each),
Sheffield (Pounds 5.9m), Hackney in London (Pounds 5.4m), and Leeds,
Nottingham, Wolverhampton, Middlesbrough and Sunderland (all about Pounds
5m).
Under the urban programme the 57 local authorities receive grant at 75 per
cent on approved capital and revenue expenditure, and supplementary-credit
approvals on the remaining 25 per cent.
