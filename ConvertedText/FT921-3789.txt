FT  12 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): RMT probes claim of ballot-rigging


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


THE RMT, Britain's largest transport workers' union, is to investigate
allegations of ballot-rigging in the NUS seamen's union, which merged with
the NUR rail union to form the RMT in 1990.
The allegations, first made in the mid 1980s, have resurfaced after the
widow of a senior official said she helped him fill in nearly 2,000 stolen
ballot papers. The 1985 ballot was cleared by a TUC inquiry in 1987.
The RMT's decision to set up a seven-member committee of inquiry is
potentially embarrassing for the Labour party because the RMT is likely to
question Mr Sam McCluskie, the party treasurer, who was NUS general
secretary at the time.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, promised a thorough
investigation. No timescale has been set, but the investigation is likely to
be long. The committee will report to the union's executive committee.
The union denied it had a vested interest in not finding evidence of fraud.
'It is an honest inquiry into allegations made about a union that no longer
exists, technically,' it said.
The inquiry committee will have a minority of former NUS officers, said the
RMT. None of them had been the subject of allegations.
