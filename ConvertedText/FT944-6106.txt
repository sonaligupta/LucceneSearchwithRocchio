FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian alumina refinery planned
to produce 1m tonnes a year


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


An USDollars 800m alumina refinery is to be built in India to produce 1m
tonnes a year of the essential raw material for aluminium production.
Output should begin at the turn of the century, a time when a serious
shortage of alumina 'is a strong possibility', according to the CRU
International consultancy group.
The Indian plant will be located in the eastern state of Orissa, a region
with plentiful reserves of bauxite, the raw material for alumina.
At present ownership of the project is equally shared by Indian Aluminium
Company (Indal), Tata Industries of India and Hydro Aluminium, part of Norsk
Hydro, Norway's biggest industrial group. Indal, in turn, is 40 per cent
owned by Alcan of Canada. The partners plan to widen the ownership by
arranging a stock market floatation for Utkal Alumina International, set up
to operate the plant. Utkal will use technology supplied by Alcan and
Alusuisse.
A Dollars 5m feasibility study suggested that the refinery could produce
superior grade alumina for Dollars 80 a tonne compared with the present
world average of Dollars 142.
Most of the output will be exported, mainly to smelters in the Middle East
and North America.
Meanwhile, CRU, in its latest five-year outlook for alumina, suggests that
construction must start on four or five big new projects in the second half
of the 1990s to avoid capacity shortages.
However, in the short term, the outlook for alumina prices is not good. A
price recovery from present depressed levels might not begin for up to 12
months, says CRU.
There are no signs that those companies that temporarily shut down primary
aluminium smelting capacity following the international trade agreement
early this year are gearing up for early re-starts. Fixed prices for
one-year alumina contracts have drifted down to Dollars 125 to Dollars 135 a
tonne for 1995 delivery, while spot prices range between Dollars 110 and
Dollars 120 fob, depending on origin.
But CRU is forecasting strong demand growth for alumina - by 4 per cent a
year starting in 1996 to the year 2000, compared with only a 1 per cent
increase in refining capacity. It says this will lift alumina prices above
Dollars 300 a tonne within three to four years.
London Metal Exchange aluminium prices yesterday recovered Monday's losses,
the three months position closing Dollars 39.50 up at Dollars 1,889.50 a
tonne.
