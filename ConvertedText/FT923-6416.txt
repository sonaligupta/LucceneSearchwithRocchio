FT  25 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Turkey agrees power plant deal


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ANKARA


TURKEY has agreed terms for a build-operate-and-transfer (BOT) coal-fired
power plant, under a deal signed with a US consortium led by Trinity
Partners International of Pennsylvania.
The privately-financed 237MW plant at Cankiri Orta, 130 miles from Ankara,
is estimated to cost Dollars 500m (Pounds 260m) including developing a
nearby 100m tonne coal deposit.
Trinity Partners, with Pagro Power Alhlstron, will build and run the plant
for 26 years under the BOT arrangement before handing over to Tek, the
Turkish power utility.
The project, the first big infrastructure deal agreed by the government of
Mr Suleyman Demirel, will encourage investors trying to get BOT proposals
started.
Ankara is studying a similar arrangement for its city Metro. Lockheed has
been negotiating a BOT proposal for Istanbul airport for two years. Thames
Water, in a consortium with the local Gama group, is seeking agreement with
Istanbul's water authority to take water from a proposed dam and pipeline
project at Izmit.
The Trinity consortium will use Alhlstron's fluidised bed technology,
employing low calorific lignite coal without the extra investment of
emission scrubbers.
The company says the design, well tried under US environmental conditions,
meets World Bank and Turkish emission standards.
The consortium has been given until December 1993 to arrange finance.
Hambros Resource Development Incorporation in Chicago is lead bank. Equity
will account for 20 per cent, the rest raised in loans. The company is
looking to the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's
private-sector lending arm, to take an equity role.
It will recover its loan costs by selling power to Tek at pre-arranged
prices.
