FT  28 MAR 92 / EC backs Dutch on Indonesia


The Dutch are likely to get backing in their aid row with Indonesia from the
rest of the European Community, which has taken a firm diplomatic stand
against last year's killing of protesters in Indonesian-annexed East Timor,
EC diplomats said in Brussels yesterday, write David Buchan in Brussels and
William Keeling in Jakarta.
The Dutch Foreign Ministry said yesterday that it accepted Jakarta's
decision to reject its aid and chairmanship of the consortium of official
aid donors to Indonesia.
