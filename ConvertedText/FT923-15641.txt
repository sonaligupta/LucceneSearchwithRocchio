close

BRISK buying by investment trusts lifted share prices yesterday, but the
Nikkei average failed to regain the psychologically important 16,000 level
in the face of continued arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed 210.46 up at 15,951.73. After opening at the day's low of
15,785.13, the 225-issue index rose to the session's high of 16,060.92 in
the early afternoon on small-lot bargain hunting and index-linked buying.
However, arbitrage unwinding pushed it lower towards the end of the day's
trading.
Volume rose from 155m shares to 210m. Advances led declines by 521 to 391,
with 168 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 11.09 at 1,236.20. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.44 to
977.51.
There was some disappointment that the Nikkei failed to remain above the
16,000 mark on the last day of June, the book closing day for some
investment trust funds at trust banks. Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &
Drew said buying to manipulate share prices was especially active towards
the end of the session. Other buyers included investment trust funds which
had been set up last week.
In spite of the rise in the index, construction and property-related issues
were weak. Worries over the financial soundness of construction companies
were triggered by a report from a leading foreign brokerage, focusing on
loan guarantees of construction companies, which circulated in the market.
'The rise in outstanding loan guarantees means an increase in potential bad
debt,' said a real estate analyst at a US brokerage. Sato Kogyo, whose
outstanding loan guarantees have risen by 65.8 per cent from the previous
year to Y120.9bn, fell Y81 to Y710. Penta-Ocean Construction lost Y44 to
Y795.
High-technology blue chips, which were previously sold off, firmed on
bargain hunting. Toshiba, the most active issue of the day, improved Y6 to
Y647 and NEC Y21 to Y824.
Banks, which have been heavy losers, gained ground, with Industrial Bank of
Japan putting on Y80 to Y1,530 and Fuji Bank Y60 to Y1,290.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y10,000 to Y591,000. The
government's decision to allow foreign ownership of the shares from August 1
encouraged buying.
Isetan, the leading department store, fell Y230 to Y1,600 on rumours of
financial problems at its leading shareholder, well known for its share and
land speculation activities.
In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 93.60 to 18,689.02 in volume of 13.5m
shares.
Roundup
YESTERDAY'S trend in the region was neutral to better, and trade was mostly
quiet. Manila was closed for a public holiday marking the inauguration of Mr
Fidel Ramos as president of the Philippines.
HONG KONG advanced, as a wave of afternoon buying overcame midsession
declines. The Hang Seng index rose 46.02 to 6,103.92 as turnover slipped
from HKDollars 3.76bn to HKDollars 3.46bn, its lowest for a week.
Analysts argued over reasons for yesterday's volatility, some blaming
longstanding talk of a Hutchison Whampoa rights issue, and others linking it
to the settlement of old futures positions, followed by the setting up of
new ones.
Banks turned in the day's best gains, followed by property counters.
Utilities and the commerce and industrial sector lagged well behind.
TAIWAN reversed a run of six consecutive declines, the weighted index
rallying 56.31 to 4,523.81 ahead of today's bank holiday, in turnover of
TDollars 18.4bn, down from TDollars 21.1bn.
A technical rebound in financials, after sharp falls last week, led other
sectors higher; China Development saw heavy trading and appreciated TDollars
7 to TDollars 109. Brokers also said that the market was boosted in late
trading when some legislators again proposed changing the stock transaction
tax in parliament yesterday.
AUSTRALIA ended its financial year quietly firm, with the All Ordinaries
index just 2.4 higher at 1,644.7 in moderate turnover of ADollars 245m.
Domestic issues saw little interest as dealers squared their books, but News
Corp jumped 78 cents to ADollars 21.08 on strong US buying and the gold
index climbed 14.9 to 1,145.8.
ANZ McCaughan Securities saw hope for domestic demand, saying that the
introduction of compulsory pension savings in Australia from today will
boost share market activity.
NEW ZEALAND was subdued awaiting tomorrow's budget, the NZSE-40 index
finishing just 0.66 up at 1,520.65.
DHAKA's all-share index rose 7.39 to 386.98 in anticipation of the
government's decision to waive capital gains tax on shares, which takes
effect from today.
