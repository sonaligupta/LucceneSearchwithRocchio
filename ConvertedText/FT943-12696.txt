FT  23 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Focusing on successful technological
innovation


   From Mr JOHN DODD


Sir, The article by Tom Foremski, 'When IT fails to measure up', and Guy de
Jonquieres' argument against the benefits from investment in high
technology, raise crucial issues.
One of the less well publicised results of the EU Corfu summit was the
acceptance of the Bangemann report, the thrust of which is that rapid
deployment of the 'information society' is central to Europe's, and
therefore the UK's, competitiveness.
At the heart of the issues being raised is the insufficient understanding by
business managers of the implications of the technology they are using and
technologists' lack of awareness of the business implications of what they
are developing and installing. (This, incidentally, is one of the causes of
the UK's ability to innovate but relative inability to capitalise on
innovation.)
The FEI, the trade association for the electronics industry, is stepping up
its efforts to address these issues. Two areas come to mind for action.
First, European and UK government-sponsored research and development. Here,
the focus continues to be heavily on new technological projects with less
attention paid to the processes in the technical community which move
projects to practical application. Virtually no attention is focused on the
behaviourial, management and social inhibitions to successful
implementation.
Second, UK educational policy lacks those elements that will enable people
to implement technology for business benefit and to understand the
importance of creating value and commercial success.
If these are not the right issues, we need to find those that are. We cannot
afford to continue with either the reality or a perception that the millions
poured into IT and other high technology is wasted. John Dodd,
director, ICT,
