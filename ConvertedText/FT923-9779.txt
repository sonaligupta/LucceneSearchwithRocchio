FT  03 AUG 92 / Interception of Haitians to continue


   By JUREK MARTIN


THE US government may continue to intercept Haitian boat people on the high
seas and return them home - at least for the next few weeks.
On Saturday, after several days of conflicting legal judgments, the Supreme
Court refused to reinstate the ban on interceptions ordered by a lower court
judge last week.
The highest court, however, did not pass judgment on the legality of the US
policy, enunciated by President George Bush on May 24. It gave the
government until August 24 to request a formal hearing on this critical
issue.
Since there have been two conflicting judgments on the legality of the US
policy at the appeals court level, the Supreme Court will find it hard to
duck a judgment. One hint of its likely division on this issue was evident
on Saturday when the two most liberal justices, Harry Blackmun and John Paul
Stevens, opposed extension of the ban.
This court has generally shown itself unwilling to throw out government
policy, even when it is patently uncomfortable with that policy. This was
most evident two months ago when it refused to invalidate on legal grounds
the extradition of a narcotics suspect from Mexico.
In arguments to the Supreme Court, the justice department had said that to
change policy now would precipitate a humanitarian disaster in the Caribbean
by encouraging countless Haitians to leave the island in unseaworthy
vessels.
Not directly addressed was the issue most troubling the appeals court in New
York last week, that forcible return of would-be refugees without first
ascertaining the legitimacy of their claim to asylum was in contravention of
both US law and international practice.
