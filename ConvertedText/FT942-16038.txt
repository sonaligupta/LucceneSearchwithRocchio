FT  12 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea


There was good general demand, reports the Tea Broker's Association. The few
brightest East Africans met keen competition at dearer rates, while good
mediums were more irregular. Mediums were firm to dearer but plainer
Africans tended easier with the exception of brighter Malawis which
advanced. Good liquoring ceylons sold well and were often 5 to 10p dearer
but medium and plainer descriptions were easier. Ceylons were well supported
with better quality dearer, others fully firm. Zimbabwe teas tended easier
but Malawis were fully firm. Quality 220p/kg. nom, good quality 155p/kg,
good medium 140p/kg, medium 121p/kg low medium 88p/kg. The highest price
realised this week was 268p for a Rwanda pd.
