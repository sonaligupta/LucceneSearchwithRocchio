FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Orwell and Swift would split their sides if they could see the Dispatches
episode screened again tonight in Channel 4's 'Banned' season (11.50). No
doubt neither would be surprised that, so long after their deaths (41 and
246 years) the powers that be are exerting as much effort as ever to keep
people in the dark. But amusement might verge on incredulity with the way in
which the words of republicans such as Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness are
dubbed onto pictures of their talking faces to comply with government
restrictions. Nothing in Animal Farm or Gulliver's Travels is more far
fetched.
Horizon provides yet another programme about Chernobyl (8.10 BBC2) this time
filmed right inside the concrete 'sarcophagus' built to contain the
radioactive ruins of the nuclear reactor. It joins scientists trying to
prevent another catastrophe. The third of C4's Truth About Lies
documentaries (9.00) suggests, using the example of American network TV,
that people may lie about reality more effectively when there is virtually
no formal censorship.
