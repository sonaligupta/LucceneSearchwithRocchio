AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday turned in a
14 per cent gain in fourth-quarter net earnings on strong sales of several
drugs for women.
For the three months to end-December, the company earned Dollars 372.6m, or
Dollars 1.18 a share, against Dollars 328.2m, or Dollars 1.04, a year
earlier. Last year's earnings included a one-time gain which lifted net
income by about Dollars 35m in the quarter.
Sales in the 1991 fourth-quarter rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.82bn from
Dollars 1.61bn.
For the full year, net income grew 14 per cent to Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars
4.36 a share, from Dollars 1.23bn, or Dollars 3.92, in 1990. Sales advanced
11 per cent to Dollars 7.08bn from Dollars 6.78bn.
Non-recurring items in 1990 added about Dollars 105m to American Home
Products' net income last year.
Although the results were in line with analysts' expectations, its shares
eased Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 79 3/4 yesterday.
The company surprised Wall Street in the third quarter with exceptionally
strong earnings, but it continues to lag behind the leading pharmaceutical
companies, such as Merck.
Pre-tax income increased 12 per cent in the quarter. For the full year,
earnings before taxes fell 4 per cent, reflecting several one-time items.
