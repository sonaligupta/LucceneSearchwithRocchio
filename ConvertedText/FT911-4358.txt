FT  19 APR 91 / Amnesty urges end to Kuwait killing


   By VICTOR MALLET


AMNESTY International has called on Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the reclusive
Emir of Kuwait, to intervene personally to put a stop to arbitrary killings,
arrests and torture in the country since the Iraqi forces were driven out in
February.
In a report published today, the human rights group said scores of people
had been killed and many brutally tortured by the Kuwaiti armed forces and
self-styled resistance groups since February 26.
Most of those suffering persecutionhave been Palestinians suspected of
collaborating with Iraq during its seven-month occupation. 'Victims have
been gunned down in public or taken away, tortured and killed in secret,'
Amnesty said.
The organisation's fact-finding team reported that hundreds had been
arrested and many people had apparently disappeared. Detainees said at least
seven prisoners had died in custody after torture.
'These violations are continuing and appear to be largely unchecked,'
Amnesty said. 'Their scale and persistence threaten to leave an indelible
stain on Kuwait's human rights record. This is all the more lamentable in
the light of hopes that the kind of violations that occurred under the Iraqi
occupation would be a thing of the past.'
Most abuses immediately after the defeat of Iraq were carried out by
'resistance' squads, Amnesty said, but armed forces personnel were cited in
later cases.
Torture methods included the use of electric shocks, burning with cigarettes
and acid, biting and threats of execution and sexual assault.
Amnesty withdrew allegations that the Iraqis had killed large numbers of
premature babies by removing them from incubators, because of lack of
evidence, but it said the overall picture of serious Iraqi human rights
abuses during the occupation was correct.
