FT  28 APR 94 / Chinese official snubs Patten


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


China yesterday confirmed that Mr Lu Ping, its top official in charge of
Hong Kong policy, will visit the colony next week for the first time in more
than two years.
But in a snub, underlining the sensitivity of the visit which comes just
months after the collapse in Sino-British co-operation on the colony's
political development, Mr Lu has written to Governor Chris Patten that he
has no time to see him.
The governor said yesterday that Hong Kong would be disappointed by their
failure to meet.
There were 'serious questions that we need to discuss' and that he had
written to Mr Lu earlier this month on the issue of property prices and the
civil service, he said.
Mr Lu's week-long visit - his first since January 1992 - will be taken up
mainly with meetings of a committee set up to plan China's takeover of Hong
Kong after 1997.
In spite of the snub to Mr Patten, the visit may be a step towards finding a
way of dealing with Britain on Hong Kong matters, excluding politics.
It may reinforce recent signs of a willingness to deal with 'non-political'
issues, such as airport financing and technical matters of sovereignty
handled by the Joint Liaison Group.
Mr Lu's visit will not be an easy one. He will face questioning about why he
is not meeting Mr Patten in spite of overwhelming public support for such a
meeting. He will also have to explain why a mainland journalist working for
a Hong Kong newspaper was recently jailed for 12 years.
