FT  25 MAR 92 / Argentina rebuts pope's criticism of market reforms


   By JOHN BARHAM


   BUENOS AIRES


THE Argentine government hit back yesterday at Pope John Paul II's criticism
of its economic reforms, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires.
The Pope had said on Monday that Argentina should ensure the poor do not
become 'victims of adjustment plans, or marginalised by the dynamism of
growth, to which they have contributed considerably'. President Carlos Menem
said his statements had been blown up by the press.
Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister and architect of free market reforms,
stressed that the 'legitimate demands of the poor' could only be met with
sustained reform.
