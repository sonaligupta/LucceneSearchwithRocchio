FT  20 MAY 92 / Ex-Soviet republics to settle Start row


   By LEYLA BOULTON


   MOSCOW


THE former Soviet Union's four 'nuclear' republics - Russia, Kazakhstan,
Ukraine, Belarus - are expected to agree this weekend to jointly honour the
long-delayed Start treaty reducing long-range nuclear arsenals, writes Leyla
Boulton in Moscow. A Russian Foreign Ministry official said they would sign
a protocol to be attached to the treaty.
Russia had originally argued that, as heir to the Soviet Union's
international obligations, it should ratify the treaty with the US on behalf
of other republics in the process.
