Kitty Little, the USM-traded designer and maker of consumer goods, has
signed a conditional letter of intent to purchase Groupe L'Amy, the largest
maker of spectacle frames in France.
The French company, based in Morez, had sales of FFr540m (Pounds 63.5m) in
1993. No purchase price was disclosed.
Dealings in the shares of Kitty Little, in which Benson Eyecare of the US
