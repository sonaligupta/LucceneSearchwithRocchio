FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: DSM


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, swung into a net loss of Fl 52m (Dollars
28m) in the third quarter of 1993 from a net profit of Fl 53m in the
previous year, underlining the continuing difficulties it faces in weak
European markets, writes Ronald van de Krol.
The company cautioned that it also expected to post a loss for the fourth
quarter.
The third-quarter figures take DSM's results for the first nine months of
the year to a net loss of Fl 42m from a net profit of Fl 263m in the same
period of 1992.
