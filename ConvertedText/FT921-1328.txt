FT  25 MAR 92 / Noriega's lawyers subpoena attorney


   By HENRY HAMMAN


   MIAMI


LAWYERS for General Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose drug-trafficking
conspiracy trial in Miami is nearing its end, have subpoenaed Mr F. Lee
Bailey, the noted US criminal attorney, to testify today about possibly
inconsistent statements by a star prosecution witness.
The unusual last-minute subpoena was issued after Mr Bailey notified defence
lawyers that he had previously written to the former Panamanian leader's
prosecutors about testimony by Mr Gabriel Taboada.
Mr Bailey said the testimony by Mr Taboada, which placed Gen Noriega at a
1983 meeting with the Medelln cartel, was inconsistent with information
which Mr Taboada had given him.
Mr Bailey at one time represented Gen Noriega. Later, he was retained by Mr
Taboada. In his letter to prosecutors Mr Bailey said Mr Taboada's testimony
about the meeting contradicted assurances Mr Taboada had given him that he
knew nothing which would cause a conflict for Mr Bailey in acting as lawyer
for both the general and Mr Taboada.
