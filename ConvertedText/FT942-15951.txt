FT  13 APR 94 / World Trade News: Bananas cause hitch


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


European Union ministers were called into emergency session last night to
head off an internal dispute over the EU's banana import regime which
threatened to hold up signing of the Uruguay Round world trade deal on
Friday.
Germany, backed by the Netherlands, expressed fears that signing the trade
accord could compromise its appeal against the banana regime now before the
European Court of Justice.
The European Commission says that Germany's fears are groundless.
The new EU scheme, introduced last July, imposes European-wide quotas for
cheap Latin American banana imports while more expensive bananas from
African and Caribbean countries enter duty-free.
These quotas, enforced by punitive tariffs over the permitted level, are
inscribed in the EU's Uruguay Round tariff schedule.
Ministers yesterday moved towards a compromise which would involve a formal
declaration that Germany's legal rights were not affected by the Uruguay
Round signing. However, with one minister fewer than the quorum of seven,
the meeting adjourned without a decision. Another council of ministers will
be held tomorrow.
In another last-minute hitch Portugal is objecting to any compromise being
made by the EU in negotiations this week with India and Pakistan over
textiles. Portugal is opposed to any further concessions by the EU but the
Commission argues that it needs additional flexibility to win the extra
market access in these countries it is seeking.
Meanwhile, another dispute was averted when member governments won a battle
with the Commission over the way in which the EU should sign the round.
The Commission had suggested that it and the 12 ministers should sign all at
once. However, the ministers have insisted that they sign in the
alphabetical order in which their country's names appear in the list of Gatt
members.
