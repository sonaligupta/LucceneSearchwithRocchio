FT  30 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Philips to move its audio HQ to Singapore

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to move the headquarters of its
audio business from the Dutch town of Eindhoven to Singapore, reflecting the
buoyancy of economies in the Far East and their importance in setting new
trends in consumer electronics, writes Ronald van de Krol from Amsterdam.
The move to Singapore will also bring management closer to Philips' audio
production sites in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, where the bulk of the
company's hi-fi equipment is made. Philips has only two audio production
sites left in Europe, one in Austria and the other in Belgium, which is
already being slimmed down.
Philips' main competitors, especially Sony of Japan, are also located in the
Far East.
The transfer away from Eindhoven is part of a strategy of getting closer to
the market. Previously, the car stereo business was moved to Germany, the
centre of Europe's motor industry, while the video business's management was
shifted to Vienna, where Philips produces video cassette recorders.
Philips' audio staff in Eindhoven will be cut to 20 from 66. Thirty-five
jobs will be eliminated, and the rest will be transferred to the Far East.
Overall, Philips employs 6,625 people in audio, most of them in Far Eastern
factories.
