FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fund cancellations behind
Kenwood's Y5.4bn deficit - Japanese Corporate News and Results Round-up


   By ROBERT THOMSON


KENWOOD, the Japanese audio equipment maker, reported net losses of Y5.4bn
(Dollars 49m) for the year to March after cancelling securities investment
funds and restructuring an ailing financial affiliate.
The difficulties at Kenwood, which reported net profits of Y2.7bn in the
previous year, are typical of those facing manufacturing companies which
established special investment trusts in the late 1980s.
Kenwood is also taking the typical route of electronics companies by
expanding manufacturing operations in China and Malaysia and cancelling a
planned telecommunications plant in Japan, where relative costs have been
pushed higher by the yen's appreciation.
The plunge in Tokyo stock prices forced Kenwood to report extraordinary
losses of Y9.5bn, marking the end of its indulgence in zaiteku, the
financial engineering which became increasingly ambitious during the
so-called 'bubble era'. Pre-tax profits slid 33 per cent to Y4bn, the first
fall in 11 years. Sales, which rose 1.9 per cent to Y210bn, were supported
by strong demand from east Asian markets.
