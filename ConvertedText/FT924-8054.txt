FT  13 NOV 92 / Bonn-Sofia repatriation deal


   By REUTER


   BONN


Germany will pay Bulgaria to repatriate thousands of its nationals refused
political asylum by the Germans, Reuter reports from Bonn. The two countries
signed an agreement committing Sofia to take back disqualified
asylum-seekers with German financial aid of DM28m (Pounds 11.5m) over the
next five years.
Similar agreements with Poland and Romania have been criticised for
appearing to legitimise demands of right-wing groups for mass deportations
of asylum-seekers, the target of almost daily attacks by xenophobic gangs.
About 25,000 Bulgarians have applied for asylum this year but have little
chance of getting it as Bonn feels political persecution has virtually ended
in Bulgaria with the demise of communism.
