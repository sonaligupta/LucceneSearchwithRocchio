FT  10 JAN 92 / Engineers' confidence seen to have fallen


   By ANDREW BAXTER


CONFIDENCE has fallen again in the UK engineering industry, according to The
Engineer magazine, Andrew Baxter writes.
The magazine's latest quarterly survey finds that after a slight rise in
confidence during the autumn, prompted by hopes of an end to the recession,
engineering companies are about as unhappy as they were in June and
sentiment is not far off the 'appalling' levels of December 1990.
The fall in optimism is most evident in large companies. A total of 40 per
cent of senior managers in companies employing more than 500 people are
pessimistic about their company's prospects in the next 12 months, against
35 per cent expressing optimism.
