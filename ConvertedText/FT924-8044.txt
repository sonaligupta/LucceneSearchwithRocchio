FT  13 NOV 92 / Judges condemn editors' contempt


   By JOHN MASON


ASSOCIATED Newspapers, publisher of the Mail on Sunday newspaper, and two
journalists were yesterday fined a total of Pounds 60,000 after being
convicted of contempt of court in publishing interviews with jurors from the
Blue Arrow fraud trial.
The company was fined Pounds 30,000 for committing what two High Court
judges called 'a deliberate and most serious breach of the law'.
Mr Stewart Steven, who was editor at the time, was fined Pounds 20,000 and
Mr Clive Wolman, City editor, Pounds 10,000 for what the judges called a
'serious and dangerous encroachment' on the functions of a jury. Lord
Justice Beldam and Mr Justice Tudor-Evans rejected the defence argument that
the article made a valid contribution to the debate on fraud trials.
The case is now set to go to the European Court. The journalists say the
European Convention on Human Rights gave them the legal right to publish the
article.
