FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jarvis Porter advances to Pounds 2.7m


   By JOHN THORNHILL


JARVIS PORTER, the label printing specialist, said there was evidence of a
more consistent pattern of orders emerging from its customers as it reported
a 17 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.7m.
But the company, which supplies labels for such products as Scotch whisky
bottles, toiletries and pharmaceutical packages, said it was not expecting
any 'sudden increase in demand'.
Mr Richard Brewster, chief executive who joined Jarvis Porter after
engineering a spectacular period of growth at David S Smith, the paper
group, said the results were 'better than he expected'.
The company's shares closed 10p higher at 136p as a result of the confident
statement.
In the year to February 29, sales rose from Pounds 27.87m to Pounds 28.4m.
Sales were boosted by Pounds 3.8m and operating profits by Pounds 400,000 as
a result of the inclusion of the recently-acquired Glasgow-based Holmes
McDougall label business.
The acquisition, which was completed in June, was said to have 'bedded down
extremely well'. Jarvis Porter spent a further Pounds 2.9m investing in
upgrading its technology.
However, the company recorded a sharp drop in earnings from 8.6p to 6.8p
after making a Pounds 500,000 provision against anticipated rationalisation
costs. Jarvis intends to cut its production facilities from three to two
sites.
A final dividend of 3p was recommended lifting the yearly pay-out to 4.4p
(4.2p).
