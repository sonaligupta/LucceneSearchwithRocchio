FT  16 MAR 94 / Radio licence set to go to dark-horse bidder


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


A dark-horse bidder backed by US and Australian broadcasting groups
yesterday emerged as the most likely winner of the UK's third national
commercial radio licence with a bid more than Pounds 1m larger than its
nearest rival.
Talk Radio UK, which plans to offer 24 hour a day phone-ins, debate and
conversation, bid Pounds 3.82m a year - the highest of six bids. In second
place was Newstalk UK, a consortium led by Associated Newspapers, publisher
of the Daily Mail, which bid Pounds 2.756m.
Newstalk UK, with a news and information format, may still have an outside
chance depending on the view the Radio Authority takes of Talk Radio's
business plan. The authority will be examining the company's bid in detail
before awarding the licence in June or July.
London Broadcasting Company, the news and talk company which has lost its
two London licences, also lost a lifeline yesterday - it was fourth with a
bid of Pounds 2.007m. LBC will now go off the air in the first week of
October after more than 20 years of broadcasting to London.
Talk Radio UK is a consortium put together by Media Ventures International,
a London-based media investment fund. The bid is backed by Emmis
Broadcasting - which owns and operates radio stations in Los Angeles, New
York and Chicago - and Prime Television, a company with broadcasting
interests in Australia.
The Pounds 3.8m bid - plus 4 per cent of advertising revenue which goes to
the Treasury and an annual Pounds 400,000 licence fee to the authority
before transmitter or any other costs - looks high for a talk station. The
authority will now be looking carefully to see whether the service can be
sustained over the eight years of the licence with such costs.
When awarding the national pop music licence the authority rejected the
highest bid, Pounds 4.01m from National Broadcasting Company, and gave the
licence to the second-highest bidder, Virgin 1215, which bid Pounds 1.883m.
Mr Christopher Turner, a director of Media Ventures, denied last night that
the Talk Radio consortium had bid too high.
'It depends on your cost base,' he said. The company would not set up
expensive news operations but would use basic news headlines to stimulate
debate and controversy. In the US, he said, the chat format was among the
most successful.
