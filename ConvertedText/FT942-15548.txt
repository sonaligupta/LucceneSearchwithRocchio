FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Advance of 25% at Fleet
Financial

   NEW YORK


Fleet Financial, the largest banking group in New England, which recently
announced a large cost-cutting programme, yesterday reported a 25 per cent
increase in first quarter net income.
The group, rumoured to be in preliminary merger talks with Bank of New York,
reported net income of Dollars 133.1m, or 80 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 106.3m, or 66 cents, in the same period last year.
However, the figures were towards the bottom of analysts' expectations,
which ranged as high as 90 cents a share, and Fleet shares dipped Dollars 1
3/8 to close at Dollars 38 1/4 .
The results included an additional pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars
25m for the cost-cutting programme, which involves staff cuts of 5,500 and
is designed to increase pre-tax earnings by Dollars 350m a year. The group
recorded a Dollars 7.4m after-tax gain on the sale of a factoring business.
Mr Terrence Murray, chairman, said the bank was experiencing 'both strong
earnings and significant reductions in asset quality costs. We expect to
sustain these encouraging trends if the economy continues to improve,
particularly in the north-east.'
Fleet's return on assets was 1.14 per cent, compared with 0.96 per cent, and
its return on equalised equity was 16.08 per cent, up from 15.24 per cent.
The improved ratios were helped by a sharp fall in non-performing assets,
which totalled Dollars 609m at the end of the quarter, down 35 per cent from
12 months earlier. Net write-offs were 60 per cent lower, at Dollars 32m,
and the provision for credit losses was Dollars 22m, down from Dollars 85m.
Fleet's net interest margin dipped 25 basis points, from 5.03 per cent to
4.78 per cent, compared with the previous year, due to the Federal Reserve's
tightening of monetary policy, and net interest income fell Dollars 9m to
Dollars 504m. Non interest income totalled Dollars 299m, down from Dollars
310m.
IBCA, the European ratings agency, yesterday raised its long and short term
ratings for three New York money centre banks, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and
Chemical Banking, citing the improving performance and prospects for the
trio.
