FT  10 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Canada's coastal splash-out


   By BERNARD SIMON


North America's property slump was not in evidence when 100 apartments in
the Park View tower went on sale in Vancouver last November. Although the
25-storey building is still just a hole in the ground, every unit was
snapped up within 10 days, at prices from about CDollars 225,000 to CDollars
750,000 (Pounds 105,000 to Pounds 350,000) apiece.
Park View marks the first stage of Pacific Place, Canada's biggest real
estate development. The ambitious CDollars 2.5bn project on the southern
fringe of Vancouver's business district is designed to turn the
now-flattened site of the Expo 86 World Fair into a residential and
commercial complex, sprawling over more than 200 acres.
If all goes to plan, the waterfront development will include 9.2m sq ft for
42 residential buildings and 3m sq ft for shops, offices and a 400-room
hotel.
The sponsor of the Pacific Place project is Concorde Pacific Developments, a
company controlled by Mr Li Kashing, the Hong Kong magnate. Cheung Kong Real
Estate, another Li Kashing company based in Hong Kong, sold about half of
the 100 Park View units to investors in the Far East, while the Park View
development is being financed by Hongkong Bank of Canada, a subsidiary of
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp, of which Mr Li is deputy chairman.
The response to the Park View offering might have been less enthusiastic
were it not for a widely held perception that Vancouver is on the verge of a
period of explosive growth. Property developers compare the future of
British Columbia over the next decade or two with California in the 1950s
and 1960s. The population of Canada's most westerly province is already
growing faster than in the country's other 10 provinces, rising 2.7 per cent
in 1990 and by about 2.6 per cent in 1991.
Many of the new arrivals are from eastern Canada, drawn by the more
temperate weather and easygoing lifestyle. But there has also been a huge
influx of immigrants from Asia, especially Hong Kong, in the past five
years.
Far Eastern money has already left its mark on the Vancouver skyline. Three
quarters of the city's hotels and dozens of office buildings, shopping malls
and apartment buildings are owned by Asian investors. Hong Kong and Japanese
developers have been the most active, but Mr Jon Markoulis, vice-president
of Concorde Pacific, says there has been growing interest recently from
Singapore and Taiwan. He estimates that foreigners currently account for
25-30 per cent of all property sales in the city.
Mr Li and his partners bought the Pacific Place site from the British
Columbia government in 1988 for CDollars 320m. Concorde Pacific made a down
payment of CDollars 50m, with the rest to be paid between 1994 and 2003.
Bank of Montreal has promised construction finance for the second
residential tower. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is among the minority
shareholders in Concorde Pacific.
Development of Pacific Place is scheduled to take 10-15 years. Construction
of the first building is six months behind schedule, but Mr Markoulis blames
a complex municipal planning approval process, rather than a soft market. He
says that Concorde Pacific's plans for the project as a whole have not
slowed down at all.
Pacific Place is separated from the central business and shopping district
by almost a mile of rundown warehouses and light industry. But Mr Markoulis
rejects any comparison with London's Canary Wharf. He describes Pacific
Place as an 'in-fill' project, rather than one stranded far from the city's
existing hub. A commuter rail station built for Expo 86 is adjacent to the
site of the proposed hotel and the project's commercial core.
Overall, Vancouver has not escaped the downturn in the North American
property market. According to Colliers Macaulay and Nicolls (CMN), a large
real estate broker, the downtown office vacancy rate is 14 per cent. While
nominal rents for prime space are around CDollars 25-CDollars 30 a square
foot, inducements (which can total as much as three years of rent on a
10-year lease) almost halve the effective rate.
'There has been a decided cooling towards investment in office properties,'
says Mr Ray Ahrens of CMN's office leasing group. The commercial component
of the Pacific Place project is unlikely to be built before the mid-1990s.
Optimism is high, however, that the recovery, especially in the residential
market, will be more vigorous in Vancouver than in most other parts of the
continent. Even now, the white and yellow signs which advertise developers'
re-zoning applications are as eye-catching in the downtown area as the 'for
sale' and 'for lease' notices.
Across town from the Concorde Pacific project, a Canadian developer,
Marathon Realty, is in the final planning stages of an 82-acre development
known as Coal Harbour. Marathon received zoning approval in early December
for the first phase of the project, consisting of six residential towers
spanning three city blocks.
Coal Harbour, most of which used to be a railway marshalling yard, has the
advantage of a spectacular view across Burrard Inlet to the snow-capped
mountains which dominate the Vancouver skyline. Marathon expects to start
selling fully serviced sites next year and, barring a further weakening in
the market, construction is due to start towards the end of 1993 or in early
1994.
No buildings have yet sprouted on the desolate Expo 86 site, but Pacific
Place has already become a magnet for other developments. Eight blocks of
flats are going up nearby, and the Vancouver city council has decided to
move the main municipal library to a site adjacent to the project. Rundown
warehouses in the vicinity are also gradually being transformed into
restaurants, design studios and upmarket shops.
