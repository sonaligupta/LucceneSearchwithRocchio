FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Turnround at marginal mine lifts
Anglovaal


   By PHILIP GAWITH


A TURNROUND in the performance of the marginal Loraine mine allowed the four
gold mines in the Anglovaal group to increase net profits by 14 per cent to
R41.6m (USDollars 14.9m) in the December quarter, writes Philip Gawith.
Last year, management announced that a return to profitability - following
an R18.9m loss in the year to September - meant Loraine should be able to
stay open for at least a further year.
The mine made a R2.8m profit in the December quarter, against a R2.6m loss
the previous quarter, after a rationalisation of the mine's operations.
However, the mine has to secure satisfactory hedging prices for at least
half its production. The gold price has declined to R31,000/kg, compared
with R32,700/kg when the announcement was made.
Hartebeestfontein, which produces more than 80 per cent of the group's
profits from gold, had a steady quarter, with profit after taxation of
R34.4m, virtually unchanged from the previous quarter.
