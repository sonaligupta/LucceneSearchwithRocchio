FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Sweetner producer plans to
quadruple capacity

HOLLAND Sweetener Company (HSC), Europe's only producer of aspartame, a
low-calorie sweetener used mainly in soft drinks, plans to quadruple
production capacity in preparation for an assault on the US market, the
preserve of NutraSweet of the US.
HSC, a joint venture between Dutch chemicals group DSM and Tosoh of Japan,
is to invest more than Fl 100m (Dollars 55m) in expanding the production
capacity of its plant in Geleen, the Netherlands, from 500 tonnes to 2,000
tonnes a year by late 1993.
At the end of this year, NutraSweet, a subsidiary of Monsanto and the
world's leading supplier of aspartame, faces the expiry of restrictive
patents which have kept competitors out of its domestic market. The US
accounts for 80 per cent of the Dollars 1bn global market for aspartame, an
'intense sweetener' which is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
Mr Winfried Vermijs, president of HSC, said the Dutch-Japanese joint venture
expects to win between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the US aspartame
market within five years of the patents' expiry.
However, NutraSweet, together with Ajinomoto, its Japanese partner, is
reported to be planning to build an aspartame plant in France, bringing
greater competition to Europe, where HSC has managed to wrest a 30 per cent
market share away from NutraSweet in the four years since the joint venture
first began commercial production.
Mr Vermijs said the sharp rise in capacity would not lead to a surplus. 'The
world market is growing at 10 per cent a year,' he said.
