FT  13 APR 94 / Bank sues over 'stolen' used notes


The husband of an employee of the Bank of England's note destruction depot
tried to invest Pounds 100,000 in used notes in a mutual insurance society,
a court heard yesterday.
The Bank of England yesterday sued three families who, according to counsel,
lived the 'life of Riley' on up to Pounds 600,000 allegedly stolen from the
depot in Essex.
Police took an interest after Mr Peter Gibson went to invest Pounds 100,000
with the Reliance Mutual Insurance Society in Ilford early in 1992, Mr
Anthony Boswood QC, for the Bank, said.
The manager, Mr Anthony Day, and his assistant were amazed when he emptied
the cash in bundles of Pounds 20 and Pounds 50 notes out of a carrier bag on
to his desk, he added.
Mr Boswood said former employees Mrs Christine Gibson, Mr Kenneth Longman
and Mr Michael Nairne took part in the systematic theft of cash, mostly in
Pounds 20 and Pounds 50 notes. He told Judge Rudd at the High Court that Mrs
Gibson would smuggle the notes out in her clothing.
Cages containing the notes to be destroyed were accessed by two padlocks -
one white and one black. Mrs Gibson had a key which opened all black
padlocks and she sometimes managed to ensure the other padlock was also
black, though disguised as white, enabling her to open both of them.
Mr Longman was involved in two chance thefts from the cages which netted him
at least Pounds 150,000, said Mr Boswood.
The bank is suing Mr and Mrs Gibson, Mr Longman and his wife Janet, and Mr
Nairne and his wife Sharon, all of Loughton, Essex.
The bank's action against another employee, Mr Kevin Winwright, of Writtle,
near Chelmsford, Essex, has been settled. He has served an 18-month sentence
for stealing Pounds 170,000 in notes.
The hearing was adjourned until today.
