FT  22 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: The ring cycle - A commitment that matters


   By LUCIA VAN DER POST


The rite of the engagement ring, I discovered when doing a bit of research a
few weeks back, lives on - in the UK at least. In Britain, 96 per cent of
men buy their brides-to-be an engagement ring. And very nice, too.
But these days, if statistics are to be believed, marriage is not what it
used to be and a 'relationship' has become the new institution. For any
jeweller worth his chisel these changing times represent a challenge.
So it had to happen - what we have now is the commitment ring. No longer is
there any excuse for a chap to be stingy with the jewels - the commitment
ring is what he can give to her when he is chary of stepping down the aisle.
Hennell of Bond Street, one of London's oldest fine jewellers, has decided
to bring itself up to date and this week launches its new, streamlined,
1990s version of the old-style engagement ring.
Designed by Dennis Gardner, Hennell's head of design, it is simple in the
extreme - in pure gold or platinum the ring is not quite closed, leaving a
symbolic gap. One of the open ends of the ring is finished with a brilliant
diamond, the ring comes engraved with two sets of initials and, for those
who like jewellery to match, there is a bracelet which is simply the
open-ended ring made larger.
The rings start at Pounds 750 (for a diamond the size of a tenth of a carat,
prices go up as the diamond gets larger and a sized-up ring with a
half-carat diamond for instance would cost Pounds 3,800).
The commitment bangles start at Pounds 2,200 and also go up as the diamonds
get larger.
Hennell is at 12 New Bond Street, London W1Y 1HE.
