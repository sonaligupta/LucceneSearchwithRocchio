to Y18.7bn

SHOWA SHELL Sekiyu, the leading Japanese oil refiner and distributor
affiliated with Royal Dutch Shell, suffered a fall in non-consolidated sales
and profits for the first half to June, due to falling crude oil prices and
higher costs.
Pre-tax profits slid 27 per cent to Y18.7bn (Dollars 149.6m) on a 4.3 per
cent fall in sales to Y764.8bn. Operating profits declined 33.3 per cent to
Y25.8bn and after-tax profits slid 21.6 per cent to Y10.8bn.
Showa Shell blamed the decline on weak crude oil prices, higher distribution
costs, and lower profit margins due to the economic downturn in Japan.
Non-operating losses were down by 45.6 per cent at Y7.1bn. Interest and
dividends received fell 52 per cent to Y3.1bn and foreign exchange losses
totalled Y2bn, but a 47.7 per cent decline in interest paid to Y9bn helped
cut losses at the non-operating level.
For the full year, Showa Shell forecasts a 14.7 per cent fall in
non-consolidated taxable profits to Y37bn.
Shell Canada is trimming its capital and exploration budget this year by
about 12 per cent to CDollars 745m (USDollars 620.8m) in response to
continuing problems in its upstream and downstream businesses, writes Robert
Gibbens.
First-half net losses were CDollars 7m or 6 cents a share, against losses of
CDollars 95m or 84 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.04bn,
down from CDollars 2.45bn. But changes in inventory accounting began on
January 1 and the latest losses would have been CDollars 17m or 15 cents a
share.
Upstream operations remained modestly profitable, under pressure from lower
natural gas and sulphur prices. Oil prices improved in the second quarter.
The company said downstream margins continued under severe pressure and
restructuring of the loss-making oil products division were continuing.
Chemicals should break even in the second half.
