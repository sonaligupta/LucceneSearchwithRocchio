FT  29 JAN 92 / Letter (3): SIB findings on life assurance policy
terminations challenged - and 'polarisation' defended


   From Ms JOANNE HINDLE


Sir, Your leader, 'Life policies oversold', argues for unit trusts to be
released from 'the shackles of polarisation'. But surely the purpose of
polarisation is to help consumers identify the status of a distributor and
determine whether or not it is acting on behalf of its client or the product
provider - ie independent or tied.
Polarisation should have nothing to do with product type and attempts to
make it do so would serve only to confuse the consumer and could eventually
weaken argument for polarisation at all. It would not take too much effort
for distinctions between products to be blurred. For example, where would
one place products such as pensions unit trust contracts, unitised
with-profits contracts, etc?
Polarisation rules should be strengthened to ensure standards of disclosure
of status are improved. It is for the distributors of any financial product
to make every effort themselves to educate consumers as to the efficiency
and appropriateness of that form of investment. However, nothing must affect
a consumer's understanding of the meaning of polarisation and the status of
the distributor.
