CSL, the Australian drug company which was formed as Commonwealth Serum
Laboratories in 1916 and is owned by the federal government, is to be sold
off in a ADollars 260m to ADollars 312m (USDollars 186m to USDollars 224m)
stock market flotation next month.
Mr Kim Beazley, finance minister, announced yesterday that 130m shares would
be offered at a price range of ADollars 2 to ADollars 2.40.
Private investors can apply at the upper price of ADollars 2.40, while
institutional investors can apply at prices within this range.
The institutional bidding process will determine the final price, and
private investors will then receive a refund if the final price is less than
ADollars 2.40.
The flotation will not be underwritten, and Mr Beazley claimed that the
pricing arrangements provided 'the greatest flexibility to withstand
changing market conditions'.
The government statement said that CSL has forecast an after-tax profit of
Dollars 20.4m for the year to end-June 1995, and sales of ADollars 219m.
Exports will account for around 10 per cent of this revenue. Expected
spending on research and development is put at ADollars 27.6m.
