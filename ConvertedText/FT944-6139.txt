FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Babcock hopes to pay
dividend this year

Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering group which has been battered by
the recession, reported preliminary gross profits of about DM90m (Dollars
57.7m), up from DM62m last year, and said it hoped to be able to pay a
dividend after a six-year break.
'We have a profit which is more or less the required size (for a dividend
payment),' Deutsche Babcock said after the company reported preliminary
figures for the year ending September 30.
Ordinary shareholders last received a dividend, of DM6.50, in 1988. A final
decision about this year's dividend depended on the agreement of the
supervisory board, the company said.
Fierce competition in all areas of its business - which range from
power-station turbines to environmental technology - had put the company
under intense pressure, the company said.
Turnover for the year was unchanged at DM8.2bn while new orders fell 9 per
cent to DM8.5bn, down from DM9.3bn.
German clients, who are still feeling the effects of the recession, ordered
16 per cent less during the review period.
However, the company was able to keep its foreign orders, which represent 45
per cent of new business, steady at DM3.8bn.
Deutsche Babcock said the new orders figures did not include a DM1.2bn
contract for a brown coal fired power station in eastern Germany where
planning approval has not yet been given.
Deutsche Babcock said it did not know when work would begin on the project
but said there was no risk that the project would not go ahead.
The company said it would be shedding a further 1,200 jobs over the coming
year, bringing the workforce down to 35,000.
Deutsche Babcock will have to spend a further DM50m on redundancy pay and
other restructuring which has already cost the group DM355m over the past
three years.
