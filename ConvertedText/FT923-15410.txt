FT  02 JUL 92 / Poles may have election soon


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


The prospect of an early election was raised in Poland yesterday when Mr
Waldemar Pawlak, prime minister-designate, told parliament he would resign
if it failed to support him, Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw. The
crisis came when Mr Pawlak, 32, leader of the Peasant party, who was
designated premier less than a month ago, found himself all but abandoned by
three key parties with which he had hoped to form a government.
