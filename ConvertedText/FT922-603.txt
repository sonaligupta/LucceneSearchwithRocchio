FT  26 JUN 92 / Suspension of US rail dispute likely


   By Our Foreign Staff


THE IMPOSITION of a 20-day suspension of the US rail dispute was likely last
night after a Congressional sub-committee had voted yesterday to require
such a cooling-off period, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Acccelerated procedure in Congress was expected to pass the necessary order
to President George Bush's desk for signature by early today. An arbitrator
would impose a settlement at the end of the 20 days, if unions and employers
were still unable to agree on new contracts.
General Motors said last night it expects to idle three assembly plants
today and run shortened shifts at two others. This was the clearest sign yet
of industrial disruption flowing from the rail dispute. Rail operators in
the US have responded to the machinists' union strike by halting freight
operations across the country.
