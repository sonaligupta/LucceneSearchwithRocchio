FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Managers of India Fund suggest
unit trust structure


   By SIMON LONDON


THE MANAGERS of the India Fund, one of the largest country funds quoted on
the London market with net assets of more than Pounds 300m, (Dollars 531m)
have proposed it could be restructured as a unit trust.
Merrill Lynch, which manages the fund, said that the change in capital
structure would close the discount to asset value at which the shares
currently trade.
With an open-ended or unit trust structure, the unit price should reflect
the asset value of the fund.
The rapid rise of the Indian market this year has not been reflected in the
share price of the India Fund.
Yesterday shares were quoted at Pounds 3.44, a 37 per cent discount to asset
value. When the fund was launched in 1986, by comparison, shares were quoted
at 100p.
An open-ended structure can be difficult for investment managers however,
since assets may have to be liquidated rapidly if investors withdraw funds.
Merrill Lynch said that an extraordinary meeting of shareholders would be
called next year in order to vote on the proposals.
A 75 per cent majority in favour would be required for any change of capital
structure to be implemented.
