FT  26 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: MAS agrees Dollars 170m loan
to fund expansion


   By KIERAN COOKE


   KUALA LUMPUR


MALAYSIA Airlines System (MAS) has agreed a three-year Dollars 170m
syndicated loan facility with 27 international banks to help finance its
expansion programme.
The loan, arranged by the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), Wardleys and
Indosuez Asia, will be used to part finance the acquisition of more than 70
new air-craft.
This month MAS announced it would be making a one-for-one rights issue at
the end of the year, designed to raise more than Dollars 700m.
MAS has rapidly expanded its fleet and route network in recent years, but
has seen profits slide. In the year to March 31 1992, pre-tax profits fell
to MDollars 119.5m (USDollars 47.6m) from MDollars 205.5m the previous year.
This week the Malaysian government approved an MAS request for air fare
rises of between 15 and 20 per cent on domestic routes. They have been
frozen for the past 10 years.
