FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Graseby surges ahead to Pounds 9.57m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Graseby, the medical electronics, product monitoring, environmental and
defence technology group, yesterday reported sharply higher 1993 profits
reflecting growing international sales, lower interest costs and the absence
of exceptional charges.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December jumped to Pounds 9.57m from the
depressed Pounds 1.02m recorded in 1992, when they were reduced by Pounds
4.3m of net exceptional costs.
Earnings per share jumped to 11.4p (1.3p) and, in line with the board's
previously announced decision, the final dividend is being reduced to 3.3p
(7.6p) making a total for the year of 6.6p (10.9p). The shares closed down
5p at 181p.
Turnover increased by 10.8 per cent to Pounds 113.7m (Pounds 102.6m)
including Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 22.4m) from discontinued operations. Sales
from continuing operations grew by 22 per cent to Pounds 98.7m with exchange
rate movements accounting for just over a third of the increase.
International sales grew by 21 per cent, excluding exchange rate movements,
reflecting the group's reduced dependence on the domestic market.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 11m (Pounds 7.85m) including a Pounds
501,000 contribution from discontinued operations. In 1992 discontinued
operations reduced profits by Pounds 1.32m.
The advance was led by an exceptionally strong performance by the defence
business, where a number of large orders were completed resulting in the
technology division reporting profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 571,000) on
sales up 24 per cent to Pounds 34.3m.
In contrast, operating profits and trading margins slipped in the three
other divisions despite increased sales.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.52m) partly reflecting a
decline in year-end borrowings from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 15.9m,
representing gearing of 66 per cent - down from 99 per cent.
COMMENT
Graseby has completed its transformation from a group dependent on the
volatile defence and component sectors to an international instrument
supplier focused on four distinct value-added markets. The balance sheet is
now in much better shape and borrowings should fall further - even without
the deferred flotation of Graseby Anderson in the US. Although several of
its markets - including the UK medical market - face pricing pressures, the
overall trading margin should edge higher again this year towards the
group's 15 per cent target. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m this year
should provide earnings of about 11.7p. The shares are trading on a
prospective p/e of 15.5 and look slightly undervalued.
