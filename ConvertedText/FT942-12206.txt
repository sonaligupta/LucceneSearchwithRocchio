FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong off 2.5% as
region corrects


The overnight decline in the US triggered a downward correction among most
of the region's markets.
Tokyo was closed yesterday as the Golden Week holiday began. The market will
re-open on Monday, but will then remain closed until Friday.
HONG KONG lost 2.15 per cent as the Hang Seng index closed below the 9,000
level on selling triggered by Wall Street's overnight drop and concerns over
a possible domestic interest rate rise.
The Hang Seng fell 197.02 to 8,966.07, 2.1 per cent down on the week;
turnover stayed thin at a preliminary HKDollars 3.11bn, up from HKDollars
3.02bn.
The Hong Kong Association of Banks met after the market closed and decided
not to change interest rates, which have not risen after the US Fed Funds
rate quarter point rise on April 18.
Talk that a major south-east Asian institution had cut its rating on Hong
Kong and sold a basket of blue-chip counters led to further falls.
Properties and conglomerates led the declines, with Cheung Kong down
HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 36.50, SHK Properties HKDollars 1.25 at
HKDollars 46.50, Hutchison HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 31.70 and Swire A
HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.50.
AUSTRALIA fell only slightly in contrast to other markets in the region as
many investors preferred to remain on the sidelines. The All Ordinaries
index lost 3.0 to 2,066.1, up 1 per cent on the week.
Turnover was ADollars 752.34m. News Corp went against the trend, advancing
25 cents to ADollars 9.68 ahead of results due next week which are expected
to show a 20 per cent rise in earnings.
The gold index rose 5.2 to 2,186.2, boosted by a 50 cent gain in Great

report which was released on Thursday.
Among the banks, ANZ dropped 7 cents to ADollars 4.71, Commonwealth was down
9 cents at ADollars 8.23 and Westpac slipped 2 cents to ADollars 4.74.
SINGAPORE followed US stock and bond markets lower, but its fall was limited
by interest in quality bank stocks and selected property issues  - the
latter after early falls as investors realised that a new government land
sale scheme would have little impact on property values. The Straits Times
Industrial index eased 8.45 to 2,296.19, up 1.4 per cent.
KUALA LUMPUR saw further volatility in Technology Resources Industries as
the composite index eased 0.84 to 1,054.50, up 1.4 per cent on the week,
after a low of 1,043.12.
TRI fell to a low of MDollars 10.70 on a less buoyant than expected earnings
forecast, before closing 20 cents up on the day at MDollars 11.50.
SEOUL fell as institutional investors took profits. The composite index shed
9.25 to 900.14, having seen a session high of 923.15, for a week's rise of
1.7 per cent.
Turnover was Won1,100bn.
TAIWAN lost 2.7 per cent on profit-taking particularly in the pulp and
textile sectors.
The weighted index shed 158.74 to 5,729.12, off 1.8 per cent on the week.
The paper and pulp index dropped 5.5 per cent after the sector's previous
sharp gains on higher product prices.

volume described as 'very light'.
The NZSE-40 capital index fell 17.6 to 2,110.2, up almost 1 per cent over
the week.
BANGKOK's coalition government failed to win enough votes to pass
constitutional amendments, and the SET index fell 4.47 to 1,266, for a
week's loss of 2 per cent. Turnover was thin at Bt4.5bn.
BOMBAY improved slightly on hopes of a relaxation in the ban on forward
trading which was imposed last month.
The BSE index rose 14.98 to 3,755.38, but turnover dipped to Rp200m from the
recent daily average of Rp1bn.
Brokers said that they expected the Securities and Exchange Board to
announce a relaxation in the trading curbs on Monday.
COLOMBO recorded its sharpest-ever one day fall. Brokers blamed growing
political and economic uncertainty as the CSE all-share index dropped 47.34,
or 4.3 per cent to 1,050.85 with some blue chips sustaining double digit
declines.
Political uncertainty became a factor after a stunning opposition victory in
a local government election on March 24 in which the ruling United National
Party lost a key poll after 17 years.
