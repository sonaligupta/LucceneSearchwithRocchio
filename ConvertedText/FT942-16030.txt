FT  12 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei slightly lower as
political uncertainty deepens


   By EMIKO TERAZONO

Equities lost ground slightly as uncertainty over the political situation
deepened, and most investors remained inactive, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average shed 36.91 to 19,898.08 as the divide between the
left and right wings within the ruling coalition widened. Market
participants had initially expected Mr Tsutomu Hata, current foreign
minister, to succeed Mr Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. However, with
the coalition on the edge of splitting, this seems to have become
increasingly difficult to engineer.
The index fell to a low of 19,867.47 soon after the market opened and rose
to a high of 19,999.30 later in the morning.
Both left and right wings of the coalition are trying to woo members of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party to join them. There is also a
possibility of a general election if an agreement cannot be reached soon.
There is little chance of the next government offering a totally different
approach to economic policy, and the question is how soon this year's
budget, which until now has been blocked by the LDP over Mr Hosokawa's
allegedly dubious loans and stock dealings, can be implemented.
Volume fell sharply, to 225m shares from 525m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks firmed 0.75 to 1,614.05 and the Nikkei 300 index lost 0.04 at
296.37. Advances outnumbered declines by 535 to 460, with 162 issues
unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 2.47 to 1,319.00.
Textile issues were higher on foreign buying. Teijin rose Y9 to Y541 and
Mitsubishi Rayon Y9 to Y416. Chemical shares were also among the winners,
with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals up Y5 at Y406.
Japan Energy, a mining development and petroleum refining company, dropped
Y20 to Y405. The company holds a 41.5 per cent stake in Kashima Oil, a
privately owned refiner which announced huge unrealised losses over the
weekend due to foreign exchange forward transactions.
But other shareholders of Kashima were higher on bargain hunting, Cosmo Oil
gaining Y11 at Y863 and Mitsubishi Petrochemical Y20 at Y698.
Fuji Photo Film, sold last week on fears of a decline in market share,
rebounded Y100 to Y2,140.
In Osaka, the OSE average ended 105.95 firmer at 22,071.13 in volume of 9.5m
shares.
Roundup
Renewed Japanese buying in several of the Pacific Rim markets was attributed
to the launch of fresh investment strategies at the beginning of Tokyo's new
financial year, rather than political worries following the resignation of
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister. Analysts noted that
trading volume was very thin throughout the region. Bombay was closed for a
public holiday.
HONG KONG saw a late round of buying, spurred by renewed demand from
Japanese investors, which took the market 1.9 per cent higher in otherwise
thin trade.
The Hang Seng index moved forward 178.55 to 9,476.77 in turnover that
expanded to an indicated HKDollars 2.89bn, from HKDollars 2.51bn on Friday,
but still well short of recent levels.
SINGAPORE advanced 2.9 per cent, with the rise attributed to US program
buying and some orders from Japanese investors. The Straits Times Industrial
index put on 61.71 at 2,191.95.
BANGKOK finished higher after a bout of late-session bargain hunting ahead
of a three-day national holiday from today. The SET index gained 11.26 at
1,235.26 in the lowest turnover of the year at Bt2.1bn, compared with the
previous lowest of Bt2.3bn on April 5.
SEOUL advanced for the sixth consecutive session in moderate trading as
early gains weathered afternoon profit-taking. The composite index added
11.05 at 894.47.
MANILA was marginally higher on late buying of San Miguel, after a slow
start which followed the overnight fall by PLDT in New York. The composite
index firmed 5.5 to 2,643.08 as San Miguel 'B' rose 4 pesos to 216 pesos.
TAIWAN reversed early gains and ended sharply lower on heavy profit-taking
in banking stocks after their sharp advance late last week. The weighted
index lost 77.36, or 1.4 per cent, at 5,488.48.
AUSTRALIA closed softer on one of the quietest trading days of the year,
with investors cautious ahead of US economic statistics coming this week.
The All Ordinaries index dipped 6.0 to 2,076.0.
Western Mining weakened 14 cents to ADollars 6.80 as its 48 per cent-owned
aluminium unit Alcoa reported a 5.6 per cent fall in first-quarter profits.
KUALA LUMPUR was mostly easier in continued thin trading, but institutional
buying of some core stocks left the composite index 11.39 higher at 973.34.
