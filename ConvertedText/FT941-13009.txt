FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: DY Davies losses cut to Pounds 116,000


Lower exceptional charges and interest costs helped DY Davies, the
USM-quoted architect, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 484,000 to Pounds
116,000 for the six months to October 31.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said that there had been a return of confidence
in the property investment market but this had yet to be transferred to the
property development or construction markets.
He added that fee levels remained low as a result of competitive bidding and
low demand.
Turnover was 36 per cent lower at Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.93m). Exceptional
costs were down from Pounds 387,000 to Pounds 49,000 and interest payable
was Pounds 110,000 (Pounds 157,000).
Mr Davies said that exceptional items should continue to fall as vacant
office space was let.
