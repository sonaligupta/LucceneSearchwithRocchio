FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Carlsberg posts flat half-year

WEAK demand in a number of markets, combined with adverse currency swings,
has left Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, with profits little changed for the
first six months.
Pre-tax profits for the half-year ended March were DKr4m higher at DKr694m
(Dollars 111.44m) after an improvement in net financial income to DKr214m
from DKr190m.
Had earnings by non-Danish companies been translated at the exchange rates
ruling a year earlier, pre-tax profits would have been some DKr50m higher,
the group said.
Operating profits (after depreciation) dipped to DKr480m from DKr500m,
including a DKr90m increase in depreciation. Sales were 8 per cent higher at
DKr7.25bn, against DKr6.66bn.
The Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture in the UK, which came into effect from
December 12 last year, are included in the results. The venture contributed
to the rise in sales, although specific detail is not provided.
'It is much too early to say anything about Carlsberg-Tetley. It has been
too short a period,' said Mr Walther Paulsen, a member of the Carlsberg
board of management.
The joint venture shows up in the balance sheet, with total assets of the
group increasing to DKr18.29bn from DKr14.92bn at the end of September last
year.
Carlsberg said that the recession would cause a decline in operating profits
for the full year, but this would be offset by increased financial income,
barring adverse foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
