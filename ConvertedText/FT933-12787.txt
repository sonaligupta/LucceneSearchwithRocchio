FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Dunhill shares fall on disappointing
quarter


SHARES IN Dunhill Holdings fell 27p to 340p yesterday as Lord Douro,
chairman of the luxury goods group, said that results for the first quarter
had been 'disappointing', and that there was little sign of recovery in its
key markets, particularly Japan.
Speaking at the annual meeting he said: 'A convincing recovery would now be
needed to avoid a significant reduction in operating profit from that of
last year.' He added that it was too early to assess the outlook for the
full year with any precision.
Lord Douro also said that the reconstruction of Dunhill, Richemont and
Rothmans was proceeding on schedule.
Shares in Dunhill fell almost 12 per cent from 379p to 355p on June 4 as the
group revealed lower pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 and issued a
warning for the current term.
Mr John Yates, chairman of Airsprung Furniture, told the annual meeting that
management accounts for the first quarter showed sales ahead of last year;
profits, however, were lower, albeit in line with budget. The shares fell
19p to 469p.
