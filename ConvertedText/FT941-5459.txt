FT  07 MAR 94 / Brussels battles to find fish formula


   By DAVID GARDNER


   BRUSSELS


Spain and Norway yesterday dug deeper into their already entrenched
positions on access to Norwegian cod, as the European Union struggled for a
formula to permit Norway to settle EU membership terms.
Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, warned on Spanish television
that Madrid would veto Norway's entry unless Spain recovered its 'historic'
rights' to fish in Norwegian waters.
Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, Norway's foreign minister, said on arrival in Brussels
for the final three days of membership negotiations with the EU that Spain's
demands for an extra 14,000 tonnes of Norwegian cod were 'out of the
question.'
He pointed out that as part of the negotiations leading to this year's
European Economic Area (EEA) free trade zone Norway ceded to the EU about
51,000 tonnes of cod - including an extra 11,000 tonnes by 1997 for the
poorest EU member states, some half of which is earmarked for Spain.
This last quota would lapse if Norway entered the Union next year and its
'consolidation' as a permanent quota might provide the only possible area
for compromise in the talks.
The whole EU enlargement exercise could, however, grind to a halt if Spain
and the UK continue to insist that their voting weight inside the 12-member
Union be kept unchanged in a Union of 16 members. The EU will try to resolve
this issue at a foreign ministers' meeting tonight.
