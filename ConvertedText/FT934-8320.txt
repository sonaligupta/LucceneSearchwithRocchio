FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind 26% advance at
Critchley


   By PAUL TAYLOR


CRITCHLEY GROUP, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which came to
market a year ago, yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits, bolstered by the Pounds 1.6m acquisition in May of BT's
Label Centre business.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.27m) in the six months to
September 30 on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.2m),
including a Pounds 1.61m five month contribution from Critchley Label
Centre.
On a like-for-like basis turnover increased by 9 per cent.
Operating profits, including Pounds 142,000 attributable to Critchley Label
Centre, rose to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.28m), reflecting an overall
improvement in margins, particularly overseas, and tight control of costs.
'Critchley has made good progress during the six months with an improved
contribution from all divisions,' said Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive, 'in
particular we are pleased with the progress of the Critchley Label Centre,
our first acquisition since going public.'
The core cable accessories and identification business reported a 22 per
cent increase in sales to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.2m), mainly reflecting the
new acquisition and a 28 per cent increase in direct exports which helped
offset the flat UK market.
Excluding the acquisition, the business reported a modest 3 per cent
increase in sales, held back by the discontinuance of two groups of
low-margin factored products. Like-for-like sales grew by 8 per cent.
Critchley Wound Components, which manufactures coils and transformers for
circuit boards, increased sales by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.24m while
Critchley Enclosures lifted sales by 27 per cent to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds
1.14m) and moved back into profit.
The group ended the first half with net cast of Pounds 2.4m.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 7 per cent to 9p (8.4p) and a
maiden interim dividend of 2.6p is declared.
