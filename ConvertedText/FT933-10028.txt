FT  06 AUG 93 / Tedious timewasting procedures


   By RACHEL JOHNSON


THE GOVERNMENT is seeking to eliminate 'tedious timewasting procedures' from
the inquiry system, Rachel Johnson writes.
Inspectors are to be given powers to overrule the type of delaying tactics
which turned the Macclesfield relief road inquiry into what Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, described as 'tedious' farce.
The inspector at the Macclesfield inquiry had to spend two days reading out
1,000 individually signed copies of a standard letter of objection, on the
request of the objectors' pressure group.
Inspectors will also be able to deal with objectors failing to appear on a
given day in order to prolong the length of time the hearing is sitting.
Another case that became a bugbear of the Department of Transport was the
six-month M40 extension inquiry. A woman protested that written objections
could not be read out by the department's junior counsel because he would
not use the right inflexions and emphasis.
Inspectors yesterday appeared less concerned than the government about
time-wasting. 'I've been an inspector for 12 years and I've had practically
no experience of mischievous behaviour,' said Sir Michael Giddings.
Others defended the right of objectors to have their say. Major General
Marston Tickell, inspector on the Oxleas Wood inquiry, the longest ever in
the UK, said: 'Not many objectors set out to cause delay. You don't want
them to leave a hearing feeling thwarted.'
