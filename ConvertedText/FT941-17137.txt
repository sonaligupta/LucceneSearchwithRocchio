FT  06 JAN 94 / Falling demand to shut steel plant


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


British Steel will cease manufacture of large diameter seamless tube in
April when it closes its Bromford works at Erdington, near Birmingham, with
the loss of 330 jobs, Andrew Taylor writes.
British Steel said the closure was the result of competition from more
modern plant as well as world over-capacity for this type of tube, which is
used mainly for power generation and process plant.
It said that the 75-year-old Bromford works had been making losses for
several years. The plant, which has a capacity to produce 50,000 tonnes a
year, had tried to cut costs and improve efficiency. Even so losses had
risen.
The factory sells mainly in the UK and continental Europe, but demand had
fallen leaving it with 'a severe order shortage'.
The company said it would be offering job transfers to as many as possible
of the threatened Bromford workers - but could not rule out some compulsory
redundancies.
