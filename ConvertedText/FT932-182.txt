FT  30 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Scargill faces attack on his
leadership


MR Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers,
yesterday faced an unusually direct attack on his leadership from one of his
own officials who said he had brought the union 'close to extinction'.
Mr Peter Neilson, vice-president of the Scottish area, told the union's
annual conference in Scarborough that Mr Scargill was 'totally out of touch'
with his members and that the union had 'stumbled from one defeat to
another, continually losing credibility while slowly sinking into oblivion'.
Mr Scargill said later he was 'saddened' by Mr Neilson's attack.
