FT  22 OCT 92 / World News in Brief: Metal fatigue theory


Metal fatigue was the probable cause of the Amsterdam El Al cargo jet crash
which killed about 70 people, according to the Dutch transport ministry. It
suspects the fatal chain of events began when part of a strut attaching one
of the Boeing 747's four engines to the wing broke off.
