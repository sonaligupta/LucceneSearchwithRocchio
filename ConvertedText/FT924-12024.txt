FT  22 OCT 92 / Takeover combines Lloyd's agencies


   By RICHARD LAPPER


BARDER & MARSH, the Lloyd's agency, has reached agreement in principle with
Wendover Underwriting Agency, to take over the management of five syndicates
administered by Wendover, Richard Lapper writes.
The announcement is further evidence of the rationalisation among syndicates
and agencies at the Lloyd's of London insurance market, which has suffered
badly in recent losses.
At least 50 of the 279 syndicates trading in London are not expected to
survive into next year.
