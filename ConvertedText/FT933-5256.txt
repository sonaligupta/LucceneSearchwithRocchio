FT  04 SEP 93 / Unitary authority plans delayed


THE FINAL report by the Local Government Commission on its proposals for
reorganising Derbyshire County Council has been postponed for seven weeks,
the Department of the Environment said yesterday.
Its provisional recommendation to create two unitary authorities, one for
Derby and the other covering the remainder of the county, was strongly
criticised by local MPs and employers when it was announced in May. The
commission's final decision, following formal responses from the local
community, will not now be published until November 7. It was scheduled to
be released on September 19, just before the Conservative party conference.
Final decisions on reorganisation for Durham and Cleveland have been brought
forward by two weeks, and will now also be announced on November 7.
Commissioners will start their reviews of Lancashire and Cumbria, and
Hampshire in early September, in line with the original schedule.
Mr David Curry, the local government minister, said: 'We have been looking
at ways to improve the review process and we will make an announcement as
soon as we can. The message now is that we want the commission to press
ahead with the next reviews in the programme, Cumbria and Lancashire, and
Hampshire.'
