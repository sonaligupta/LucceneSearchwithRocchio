FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Singapore SE to introduce
option trading


   By REUTER


   SINGAPORE


THE STOCK Exchange of Singapore (SES) is to introduce trading of stock
options in six local companies by the middle of this year, Reuter reports
from Singapore.
Mr George Teo, SES deputy chairman, told a seminar on Asian capital markets
that the six - which he did not name - would be among the 32 main board
companies traded under a central automated settlement system.
'Both put and call options will be introduced on six scripless equity
stocks,' he said.
The exchange would also select foreign brokers for SES international
membership, which gives wholly foreign-owned securities companies rights to
trade directly on the main board, the secondary board and the
over-the-counter market.
SES officials said the selections would be made in the first half of this
year.
Stockbrokers said about a dozen foreign securities houses, mostly from Japan
and Europe, were seeking international membership on the exchange.
Securities companies in South Korea are expected to be allowed to deal in
forward foreign exchange contracts on behalf of their clients, Mr Koh
Byung-woo, chairman of the Korea Stock Exchange said.
He told the seminar Seoul was aware of foreigners' concern over the risk of
changes in the South Korean currency's strength when they invest in Korean
stocks. The Korean stock market was opened to direct but limited foreign
investment this month.
