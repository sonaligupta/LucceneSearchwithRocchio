FT  29 APR 94 / Police in crackdown on right-wingers


   By REUTER


   JOHANNESBURG


A total of 32 white supremacists had been arrested in connection with an
election bombing campaign that has killed 21 people, South African police
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. But Mr Eugene
TerreBlanche, leader of the white extremist Afrikaner Resistance Movement
(AWB), said he expected more bomb blasts until Afrikaners achieved a
homeland of their own.
'We made another arrest late last night,' Police Colonel David Bruce told
Reuters yesterday. This followed a news conference on Wednesday, when police
announced the arrest of 31 men in a series of swoops. They also seized a
quantity of explosives, arms and ammunition.
Col Bruce said all those arrested were members of the AWB's elite
black-garbed Iron Guard (Ystergaarde).
