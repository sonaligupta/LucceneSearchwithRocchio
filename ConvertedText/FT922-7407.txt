FT  19 MAY 92 / Letter: Public sector stimulus and elimination of private
sector distortions would help meet need for affordable houses (2)


   From Mr NEVILLE LEE


Sir, Your leader of May 13 was a timely contribution to an increasingly
lively debate.
Are subsidies either necessary or even desirable? The housing market is
distorted, damaged and limited by subsidies. Why do we forget that
unsubsidised personal share ownership, personal savings invested in pension
schemes, unit trusts or life assurance provide the capital to the whole of
British industry as well as financing major investments overseas?
A fraction of this investment would provide the funds necessary to provide
good quality rented housing, and the opportunity for home ownership for all
people.
However, neither the private investor or the fund manager will invest in a
game which is not played on a level field or where the referee belongs to
the other side.
The costs of mortgage tax relief, subsidised council house sales, local
authority rents set below market value, and soft loans to housing
associations probably add up to some Pounds 10bn annually.
If these subsidies could be removed from the market and paid directly to
those in need through the housing benefit or income support mechanisms,
house prices would fall to affordable levels. Private and institutional
funds would find new houses to rent a worthwhile investment as in every
other industrial country.
Never before has there been a more appropriate time for a sound government
in a stable economy to grasp the nettle of housing choice.
