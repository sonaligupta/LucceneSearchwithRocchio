FT  26 OCT 92 / Lithuanians go to polls


   By JOHN LLOYD


   MOSCOW


VOTERS in the Baltic republic of Lithuania went to the polls yesterday to
elect a new parliament in the first elections since the state achieved full
independence last year, writes John Lloyd in Moscow.
The result is expected to be a close one. The main contenders are the
Sajudis nationalist group of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the parliamentary
chairman, which achieved independence for the country, and the Democratic
Labour party under the former communist leader Mr Algirdas Brazauskas.
In all, 17 parties are standing for the Sejm, or parliamentary assembly.
The country is in the grip of severe fuel shortages and an economic crisis,
with unemployment expected to climb sharply this winter.
