FT  22 OCT 92 / Wetherspoon float gives Pounds 46m tag


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in JD Wetherspoon, the chain of 44 Greater London pubs which offers
cheap real ale and no music, were yesterday priced at 160p, giving the group
a market capitalisation of Pounds 45.6m, writes Andrew Bolger.
The flotation price represents a p/e ratio of 12.4p and the notional gross
dividend yield is 4 per cent.
Some 14.68m shares, representing 51 per cent of the group's enlarged share
capital, have already been firmly placed with institutions.
A further 5.3m shares have been provisionally placed, but are subject to
clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private clients. The
intermediaries' offer will close next Tuesday. Dealing will begin on Friday
October 30.
The flotation was sponsored by Kleinwort Benson.
