FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Laura Ashley


Mr Jim Maxmin has always looked vaguely ill at ease in Laura Ashley. So his
departure from the chief executive's slot is perhaps unsurprising. Some of
the company's operational problems have been sorted out in the last three
years. Others, most notably in the US, have not. Several of the more serious
wounds were self-inflicted. Yet his departure, accompanied only by a brief
statement, is unsatisfactory. The appointment of Mr Hugh Blakeway Webb as
executive chairman looks like a victory for the old guard, who have let
shareholders down before. Convincing explanations will be needed at
tomorrow's results presentation.
