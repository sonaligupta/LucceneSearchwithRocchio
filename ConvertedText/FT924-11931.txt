FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (32): Attractive for
the self-disciplined - Interest-Only Mortgages / Prudent borrowers can
postpone capital repayment and save for the long term


   By JOHN AUTHERS


REPAYING THE mortgage could be easier than you think.
The classic way is through a 'repayment' mortgage, whereby you repay chunks
of the capital you have borrowed, over a 25-year term, as well as paying
interest.
Repayment mortgages are cosy. But they carry a big opportunity cost. You
have no access to that money once it has been handed over to the lender.
If you opt for an 'interest-only' mortgage, then you only pay the interest
on the loan. Instead of paying capital back to the lender, you can use that
money instead for long-term savings.
If that money is invested sensibly you should be able to make a profit when
the time comes to repay the capital.
After 25 years, you will have to repay all of the capital in one fell swoop.
That can unnerve some people, but inflation, for once, has tended to be the
borrower's ally. In 1967, you could probably have bought a property for
Pounds 5,000 - a sum which, 25 years on, is within some people's monthly
credit-card limit. However, the house price deflation of the last few years
shows that this trick cannot be relied upon to work indefinitely.
This is why interest-only mortgages have a reputation for being risky. They
can be, for the lender - for all they know, you are a spendthrift, who makes
no plans for the future, and goes bankrupt just before the end of 25 years.
But they do not need to be risky for either party, provided a serious
commitment to saving for the capital sum is made at the outset.
This explains the popularity of the endowment mortgage - an interest-only
loan which comes tied to a capital repayment vehicle. Endowments also carry
the undeniable attraction of a 'sum guaranteed'. In other words, they
guarantee to pay you at least a specific fixed sum after 25 years.
Additional bonuses can be added on top of this, and you will usually buy an
endowment on a conservative assumption for future bonuses.
But endowments are inflexible, and effectively force investors to hold on
for 25 years by offering substantially lower rates of return if policies are
surrendered early. There are more tax-efficient alternatives for those with
a little imagination.
Some lenders, such as the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society, will
offer an interest-only loan, based simply on a discussion to establish
whether applicants are responsible borrowers. C&G is adamant that this is a
'no-strings attached' mortgage - the society will not require you to take
out life insurance cover for the value of the capital. Also, there are no
redemption penalties if you happen to be able to repay some capital early.
How much difference does this make? At the beginning of this month C&G were
offering 8.25 per cent fixed for two years for loans, both repayment and
interest-only, of 80 per cent or less of the value of the property.
On a loan of Pounds 60,000, monthly payments would be Pounds 426.87, with a
repayment mortgage, and Pounds 360.94 interest-only. The Pounds 60 saved can
be used for long-term saving.
If Pounds 100,000 is borrowed, monthly payments would be Pounds 745.83 for a
repayment, and Pounds 635.94 interest-only.
The odds are that the nature of the loan will change several times over 25
years. So cheap joint-life first-death convertible renewable term assurance
may be the answer. To cover Pounds 100,000 this will cost you Pounds 15.20
per month for five years, or Pounds 21.90 per month for 10 years, according
to Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe.
Now the choice is how to do the saving. The two most tax-efficient vehicles
for long-term savings now on offer are personal pension plans (PPPs) and
personal equity plans (Peps). Mortgage 'packages' revolving around both are
available, but neither has yet been particularly popular.
PPPs are very long-term. You cannot get at your money before you retire
without losing tax advantages, but these are massive - your premiums are
grossed up when you pay into the fund, which pays no tax. A PPP also brings
free life cover with it, which may be a benefit.
They are less flexible than an endowment. But their superior tax position is
attractive, as the table provided by the accountants Stoy Hayward makes
clear.
PPP mortgages' problem is that they can tempt you to leave paying off your
debt until you retire. Then, when you do so, you might find a large chunk of
your pension lump sum has to be used to pay off the mortgage. As a rule,
pension planning is an exercise which should be undertaken for its own sake,
and not linked in with the mortgage.
This points towards Peps. They are paid for out of net earnings, but are in
other respects as tax-efficient as pensions. You have complete freedom over
when you access the cash in the Pep, and over how you spend it.
In all these respects they are superior to endowments. However, even over a
long term, investors might be bothered by the total exposure to equities
which Peps entail, so they should be topped up with tax-efficient cash
products, such as Tessa accounts and National Savings.
The big danger with Pep savings is that savers give up when returns are
looking bad. But here the flexibility of Peps again scores. The discipline
of an endowment comes from penal surrender values, which are no good to the
consumer. You can put money into five different Peps over 25 years, and
spread risk - the same exercise with endowments would be ruinously
expensive.
So an interest-only mortgage has great attractions for anyone prepared to
take their financial destiny in their own hands. As Mr Bolland puts it: 'The
lenders are treating the borrowers as sensible adults.'
