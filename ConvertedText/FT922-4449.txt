FT  05 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer


SHORT-DATED interest rates in the sterling cash markets were slightly softer
yesterday after the Bank of England forecast another small shortage in its
operations.
However, sterling futures still appeared to be reeling from the shock of
Denmark's vote on European Monetary Union (Emu), with the longer dated
contracts ending the day considerably lower than their previous close.
In the cash market, 1-month money ended the day at 9 7/8 per cent,  1/8 per
cent down on the previous night's close. 3-month Libor, an important
indicator of how the market thinks base rates will move, ended once again at
10 per cent. The rates for 6-month and 1-year money were also unchanged at
10 per cent and 9 15/16 per cent respectively.
The softening of rates followed the Bank of England's forecast of a shortage
of only Pounds 500m in the morning. This was later revised to Pounds 550m.
The Bank then purchased Pounds 550m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent,
taking out the shortage at one go in the morning.
Dealers said that a small shortage had once again removed the danger of the
cash markets over-reacting to the disarray over Emu. One dealer said: 'Any
potential fears that people may have had for the money markets have been
offset by the fact that money is cheap at the moment and prices have not
risen.' Another said that the Maastricht crisis had not changed his
perception that 10 per cent was a level from which base rates would come
down.
The Maastricht blues took a firmer grip of the sterling furtures markets,
however, where some of the longer-dated contracts ended the day a few ticks
lower. The June 1993 contract ended the day at 90.92, four ticks lower than
its previous close. This reflects the view that 3-month Libor will be at
9.08 per cent in one year's time. The September 1993 contract ended at
91.03, also down three ticks on the day. This reflects the view that 3-month
Libor will then be at 8.97 per cent.
There was little change in the shorter dated futures. The September contract
closed at 90.28, the same as its previous close.
Dealers said that the slight drop in longer-dated futures had mostly
reflected changes in the gilts market, where trading was far more active.
