FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: CPC buys 85% stake in German
foods group


   By NIKKI TAIT


CPC International, the US food company whose brands range from Knorr soups
to Hellman's mayonnaise, is buying an 85 per cent interest in Pfanni-Werke
Otto Eckart, a German potato products producer, for an undisclosed sum.
Pfanni makes a range of potato-based goods - ranging from dehydrated mashed
potatoes to fresh-packaged and frozen products. The company has three plants
in Germany and one in Poland, and annual sales stand at about Dollars 220m.
Some of the products are also exported to the US, where they are sold under
the Pfanni name.
CPC said yesterday it saw considerable scope for extending the Pfanni brand,
and expected to develop the business 'aggressively'.
