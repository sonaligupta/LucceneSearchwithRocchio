FT  05 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for sterling
mortgage-backed offer


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


THE FIRST offering this year of sterling bonds backed by performing
mortgages met strong demand yesterday, fuelled by the shortage of paper in
the sector.
The Pounds 140m issue of floating-rate notes was backed by National Home
Loans mortgages. In March, National Home Loans, the troubled UK mortgage
lender, launched a Pounds 105m issue of securities backed by non-performing
mortgages.
The new issue is backed by Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m of mortgages from NHL's
balance sheet, with the rest taken from existing pools following the
refinancing of two existing mortgage-backed deals.
Mr Nigel Terrington, NHL's finance director, said the mortgage book was now
down to less than Pounds 250m, which is financed by NHL's banks, following a
rescue package last year. The company will continue to run down its mortgage
book. It is also reviewing whether to resume lending and a decision is
expected by December, Mr Terrington said.
The latest deal pays interest at 50 basis points above Libor, which
represents a discounted margin of 52 basis points over Libor, in line with
secondary market levels, according to lead manager SG Warburg.
The deal was quoted at 100.05, above its fixed reoffer price of 99.93.
Also in the sterling sector, Denmark was yesterday taking proposals from
banks for a three to five-year bond offering totalling up to Pounds 1bn,
dealers said.
In the Canadian dollar sector, three four-year deals totalling CDollars 425m
were all priced over the three-year Canadian government bond yield, giving
an artificial boost to their yield spreads.
Both SNCF and GECC launched four-year deals priced to yield 45 basis points
over the three-year benchmark. Dealers said this represents around 20 basis
points over the interpolated yield curve.
