FT  06 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Arcadian Pounds 18.6m rights to fund hotel
purchase


   By CATHERINE MILTON


SHAREHOLDERS in Arcadian International, the leisure-based developer and
operator, will be closely watching the course of its Pounds 18.6m rights
issue to fund the Pounds 21.3m acquisition of eight hotels.
The company posted its full year results and showed accounts prepared on a
going concern basis subject to the success of the rights issue.
The full year figures show pre-tax losses have contracted from Pounds
853,000 to Pounds 440,000 in the year to April 30.
Arcadian has not paid a dividend for three years.
But it claims the support of 60.6 per cent of the equity holders.
Shareholders representing 6.1 per cent have promised to take up their
rights. The balance of the issue has been underwritten by Charterhouse.
Brokers are Charterhouse Tilney.
The 6-for-1 issue of 53.1m new ordinary shares at 35p each will raise about
Pounds 17.3m after expenses.
Shares were suspended on October 29 at 60p, ahead of publication of the
pathfinder prospectus.
Arcadian said consideration for the purchase of the eight hotels, which had
been 'independently valued' at Pounds 21.4m, would be satisfied by cash of
Pounds 5.5m for Hidden Hotels.
Arcadian is paying Pounds 3m in shares for all the equity of Clipper Hotels
at the theoretical ex-rights price of 38.5p, plus warrants to subscribe for
1.25m shares at 75p any time before the end of the year 2000. It is also
absorbing Pounds 12.5m of Clipper's debt.
After the rights and the acquisition Arcadian will be just over 10 per cent
geared with Pounds 3.5m of net debt compared with Pounds 28m of net assets.
