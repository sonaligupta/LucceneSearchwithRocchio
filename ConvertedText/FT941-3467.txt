FT  16 MAR 94 / People: Perlin leaves Sears and goes shopping for himself


House-cleaning continues at the top of Sears with the resignation of Howard
Perlin, the director in charge of acquisitions and disposals; he has been on
the board since 1984.
Perlin started seven years before that as personal assistant to Geoffrey
Maitland Smith, then chief executive and now chairman.
Perlin, 47, says that, having masterminded the disposal of Satellite
Information Services last month, he has brought the group to 'where it wants
to get, for the moment', with the business focused on retailing and home
shopping.
Since Liam Strong came in as chief executive in early 1992, there has been a
rapid turnover of executive directors. Aside from Roger Groom, who came on
to the board in 1991, Perlin was the only executive director who remained
from the pre-Strong era. Strong's own difficulties in changing the culture
at Sears were illustrated towards the end of last year when Stephen Park,
the finance director he had brought in from Hanson just 16 months
previously, resigned.
Perlin, who joined Sears from First National Finance Corporation, reckons he
has 'probably gathered more experience than most merchant bankers, having
completed approaching 100 transactions, including 30 MBOs' in his time with
the group. Disposals in which he had a hand included William Hill and Asprey
and he was also involved in the acquisition of Freemans.
He now plans to put this to good use by setting up his own private
consultancy - very much a one-man-band - with the aim of providing corporate
finance and business strategy advice across a range of industries. He is
also building up a portfolio of non-executive directorships, and has one
public company already appointment lined up.
