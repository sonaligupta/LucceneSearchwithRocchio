FT  14 APR 94 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller suffers 49% fall to Pounds
1.65m


   By TIM BURT


Shares in Barry Wehmiller International fell 6p to 162p yesterday after the
packaging equipment manufacturer reported a 49 per cent decline in half-year
profits.
At the pre-tax level they fell from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 1.65m in the six
months to January 31 as its businesses suffered under the impact of intense
price competition and shrinking demand.
Mr Michael Windsor, chairman, said: 'First order intake for several of our
businesses, particularly those dependent upon continental Europe and the UK
dairy industry, was unusually low.'
The decline was offset by increased orders at a number of subsidiaries -
including BWI Manesty, its coating operator - and new sales in east Asia and
Latin America.
Contributions from these operations helped restrict the fall in group
turnover to Pounds 37.3m (Pounds 38.6m).
Prospects in such markets encouraged the board to declare an unchanged
interim dividend of 2.4p, even though earnings per share fell by more than
half to 2.4p (5p).
The decision reflected the group's optimism that it would reverse the drop
in orders during the second half.
Mr Windsor said the company had seen demand increase significantly in recent
months, and orders were now 20 per cent ahead of 1993's year-end levels.
'We are looking for a significant recovery in the second half of this year
and believe that we will enter the next year with an enhanced order book, a
clear direction for our business and a strong balance sheet to support
further development.'
