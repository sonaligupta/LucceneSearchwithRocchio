FT  10 JAN 92 / The land of the share-owning couch potato


   By RICHARD EVANS


THOSE MOST affected by the recession might not recognise the picture, but
Britain is a highly prosperous society en-joying unprecedented wealth.
An official government handbook, published yesterday and used by British
diplomats to sell the country overseas, reveals a country with record
amounts of leisure and holiday time and a growing number of homeowners and
shareholders.
The reference book, Britain 1992, published by the Central Office of
Information, is intended to paint the country in the rosiest light, and
little mention is made of the effects of the recession or the impact of
rising unemployment.
It nevertheless presents a comprehensive contemporary picture of British
political and social affairs and gives an insight into changes over the last
decade and more. The overall impression is of a nation of leisured couch
potatoes whose life is governed by the acquisition of consumer durables. In
1989, for example, 91 per cent of full-time manual employees were entitled
to more than four weeks' paid holiday, while in 1961, 97 per cent were
entitled to only two weeks.
The number of share owners has risen to one in four of the population in
1990 from one in five three years ago and one in 13 in 1979. and the number
of people owning their own homes has risen nearly four-fold compared with 40
years ago. Home ownership in 1990 stood at 15m com-pared with 4m in 1951.
However, the average size of households has fallen from more than four
people in 1911 to 3.09 in 1961 to 2.46 in 1990 as more people live alone.
Television easily remains the favourite pastime, followed by listening to
the radio, do-it-yourself, reading and gardening. More than nine in 10
households had colour television and almost 25 hours a week on average was
spent in front of the set.
The 480-page glossy handbook, the latest of 43 annual editions, shows there
has been little change in alcohol consumption in the past decade.
However, big changes have been recorded for cinema admissions, which have
increased by 84 per cent since 1984, mail order purchases, up from 16m in
1981 to 20m a decade later, and car-related crime, which accounts for 25 per
cent of all crimes compared with 10 per cent in 1957.
