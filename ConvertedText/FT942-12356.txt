FT  29 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow follows bearish line in
bond trade


   By FRANK MCGURTY

Wall Street
Blue chip stocks fell back yesterday after wary interpretations of
first-quarter economic data triggered a sell-off in bonds, writes Frank
McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 31.23 lower at 3,668.31, while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 receded 2.77 to 449.10 in brisk
activity.
Secondary markets were mixed, with the American SE composite up 0.72 at
438.92, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.52 to 731.69.
Equity investors were surprised and disappointed by the severity of the bond
market's reaction to the Commerce Department's preliminary report on first
quarter gross domestic product. The headline figure of 2.6 per cent growth
was about a half point lower than most economists had forecast. The data
raised the possibility of a rally in fixed-rate securities, which benefit
from slow growth and inflation.
But bonds defied expectations as traders focused on a slightly
higher-than-expected 2.9 per cent rise in the fixed-weight deflator, which
is taken as a measure of inflation. The market's losses steepened in the
afternoon when a Treasury supply auction proved disappointing. Late in the
session, the price of the benchmark 30-year government bond was down nearly
two points and the yield up 17 basis points to 7.26 per cent.
The blue chips closely tracked the Treasury market until mid-morning, when
the Dow touched bottom with a 30-point decline and began to retrace its
losses. But equity investors flinched a second time when bonds lurched
downward in the afternoon. Stocks which are closely linked to the economic
cycle registered moderate declines.
Caterpillar dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 108 7/8 , Deere shed Dollars 1
3/8 to Dollars 77 1/2 and International Business Machines lost Dollars 1 3/8
to Dollars 57 1/8 . Oil stocks were also weak, with Exxon shedding Dollars 1
to Dollars 61 7/8 and Chevron Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 88 5/8 . Investors
tended to play down favourable earnings reports released during the session.
Dow Chemical slipped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 after announcing an
impressive 38 per cent earnings gain, excluding special items.
General Motors posted operating income of Dollars 1.86 a share, against 42
cents last year, but the robust results failed to move the market. Its share
price ended unchanged at Dollars 56 3/4 .
Transport issues were a bright spot amid optimism that the Teamsters union
and trucking companies would soon reach an agreement to end a week-long
strike. Consolidated Freightways climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 26 1/4 and
Roadway Services jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 70.
Airline stocks were also buoyant, helping to lift the Dow transportation
index 11.82 to 1,635.63.
Delta gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 after unveiling a plan to cut
Dollars 2bn in annual operating costs by reducing its workforce by up to
15,000. UAL, parent of United Airlines, was marked up Dollars 1 3/4 to
Dollars 128 7/8 after announcing that it had halved its loss in the first
quarter.
Canada
Toronto stocks broke a three-day winning streak, falling in moderate
activity dominated by the continued release of quarterly financial results.
The TSE-300 composite index lost 16.99 points, or 0.40 per cent, to
4,270.78, with declines leading advances 436 to 321.
Volume of 48.62m shares was above Wednesday's 42.29m and trading value rose
to CDollars 637m from CDollars 504m.
Golds recorded the day's biggest change, rising 1.87 per cent on index. In
that group, Placer Dome and TVX Gold both reported higher first-quarter
earnings. Placer's latest quarter including a gain on the sale of
investments. Placer rose 7/8 to 28 7/8 while TVX was up 1/8 to 7 7/8.
Northern Telecom named Donald Schuenke as chairman and said it expects its
gross profit margins to improve in 1995 and 1996. NorTel's shares fell 5/8
to 41 1/4.
