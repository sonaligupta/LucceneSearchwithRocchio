FT  13 NOV 93 / Government rejects CBI currency call


   By ROLAND RUDD


THE GOVERNMENT was on the defensive yesterday over its European policy after
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
warned it not to close off the option of a single currency.
Mr John Major insisted that Britain was not 'remotely ready' for a single
currency. The prime minister added that he believed businessmen were 'very
much behind the government's approach'.
In an interview with BBC Radio Mr Davies said: 'What we are slightly
concerned about is a feeling that the government is prepared to dismiss the
prospect of a single currency in the longer run, or exchange-rate stability,
which we think are, in the long-term, of interest to the business
community.'
The CBI fears the government is closing off its long-term options in Europe.
A survey of business leaders, to be published tomorrow, shows many in
business in favour of a single currency.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, appeared to distance
himself from some anti-European remarks by some colleagues at last month's
Tory Party conference. He said: 'We have taken historic decisions to move to
a single market. That process is bound to create difficulties and short-term
controversies.'
