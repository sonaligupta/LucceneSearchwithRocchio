FT  21 DEC 92 / Observer: Polish vote trick


If Poland's parliamentarians start smuggling bricks into their sessions, it
won't necessarily be to throw them at opponents. The reason will more
probably be a mini-scandal aroused when national television showed deputies
voting for absent neighbours in a critical budget-debate.
It was apparently far from the first such occurrence. Bored members find it
easy to slip away. All they need do is leave their voting card with a more
diligent colleague, who sticks it into the slot in the absentee's seat at
the right moment, and presses the appropriate button.
Since a spate of 'two-handed voting' saw the government lose by three on its
proposals for pensions cuts, it has sought to restage the vote. In the
meantime, parliament's chairman, Wieslaw Chrzanowski, has been criticising
the TV cameras for giving the wrong impression, while President Lech Walesa
has been praising them for exposing what was afoot.
Short of going back to counting each vote manually, preventing the practice
is a problem. One proposal - to fix the computer to register a vote only if
the relevant seat was occupied - seemed promising until someone objected
that deputies could bring in bricks to weigh down neighbours' seats. The
ultimate solution, perhaps, would be voting buttons that identified and
responded solely to the correct fingerprints.
