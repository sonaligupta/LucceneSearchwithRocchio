FT  06 NOV 93 / How to Spend It: Min & Dell


Min & Dell, 16 The Pines, Broad Street, Guildford, Surrey. Tel: 0483-38468.
Pounds 2.50 for the catalogue, redeemable against first purchase.
Min & Dell is a one-off. No central agency has been behind the buying
policy. You will not find in it products that you have seen anywhere else.
Founded by Anna Nicholas, who named it after her two elderly maiden aunts,
Minny & Delly, its main aim is to find a market for crafts hand-made by
elderly people.
It was founded on the premise that older people were often a repository of
traditional crafts and skills which would give pleasure to many others.
Already she has about 100 craftsmen working for her. One used to make all
the models for the Science Museum and almost all of them have been given a
new lease of life.
As yet the catalogue is quite small, covering fine knitting, basketry,
needlecraft and textiles, jewellery & metalwork, wooden crafts and toys.
Photographed here is one from a set of five of wooden dinosaurs (Pounds
34.50) all of which are packed into a strong cotton drill bag. Besides other
wooden animals there is a bag of six, happy, hand-knitted bears (Pounds 25)
which would enchant almost any child.
The children's knitwear is very attractive - lovely chunky Aran sweaters
(Pounds 55) as well as Fair Isle woollen jumpers (between Pounds 55 and
Pounds 65). The cobweb shawls would make a fine present for a new baby and
there are some very attractive hand-painted cuff-links.
