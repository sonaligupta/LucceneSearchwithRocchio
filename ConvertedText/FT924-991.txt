FT  21 DEC 92 / Role of independent directors 'growing'


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


INDEPENDENT directors are playing an increasingly important role in
regulating companies' activities in the UK, a survey published today by 3i,
a venture capital group, says.
Independent directors are well represented on public and private company
boards and form a majority in the largest companies. Most private companies
have at least one independent director.
They have increased their influence over remuneration and audit committees.
Virtually all are now chaired by an independent director and 44 per cent are
composed solely of independent directors. Two years ago, most such
committees had equal numbers of executive and non-executive directors.
Two thirds of independent directors spent between five and 30 days a year on
the task, and a quarter gave more time. Fifty-five per cent were paid
between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 15,000 a year for their services; a quarter
received between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000, and just under one in 10
received more than Pounds 30,000.
Most companies reviewed fees annually, compared with the two-to-three-year
reviews common in 1990.
