FT  09 JUN 92 / Cyprus denies breaking embargo


   By TONY WALKER


   CAIRO


CYPRUS has heatedly denied that it has become a money-laundering centre for
illicit funds transferred from Yugoslavia by an increasingly beleaguered
Serbian regime.
Mr Andreas Philippou, a senior Central Bank of Cyprus official, yesterday
described reports of up to Dollars 750m (Pounds 412m) having been lodged in
Cyprus banks and front companies by Yugoslav nationals as a 'gross
exaggeration'.
'The amount of money deposited in Cyprus by Yugoslavs is nowhere near
Dollars 750m and not even a fraction of that,' said Mr Philippou, whose
responsibilities include supervision of banks and financial institutions on
the east Mediterranean island.
The Washington Post had reported that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, and associates had shifted millions of dollars recently to
Cypriot subsidiaries, protected by strict banking secrecy laws.
The newspaper raised the possibility that Mr Milosevic and his allies may
have been using Cyprus, with its thousands of registered offshore companies,
to circumvent United Nations trade and financial sanctions.
Mr Philippou angrily rejected suggestions that Cyprus had helped Serbian
nationalists defy UN sanctions. The government, he said, implemented UN
sanctions immediately and local financial institutions were under strict
instructions to freeze transfers of Yugoslav funds. The Bank of Cyprus
official said Yugoslavia's use of Cyprus as a trading post in the
Mediterranean and a centre for offshore companies had been 'going on for
years'. He estimated that Cyprus had some 8,000 offshore companies, but he
was unclear how many of these were Yugoslav-owned.
He described reports of huge sums being moved by Milosevic associates as
'rumour-mongering'. He insisted there had been no surge of financial
transfers since the troubles intensified in Yugoslavia.
