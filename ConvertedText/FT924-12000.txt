FT  22 OCT 92 / Volume fall hits House of Lerose


A DECLINE in volume from its branded businesses, both in the UK and the
Netherlands, was the main reason for a sharp fall, from Pounds 425,000 to
Pounds 51,000, in pre-tax profits at House of Lerose in the first half of
1992.
Turnover at the women's wear group dropped from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 6.47m.
Earnings per share fell sharply from 4.9p to 0.6p, but the interim dividend
is held at 3p.
Mr Martin Rose, chairman, said efforts were being concentrated on the design
and marketing of products. It was unlikely these would have a significant
impact until later in 1993.
Net cash balances were Pounds 8.5m at June 30, against Pounds 6.8m six
months earlier. A further Pounds 1.1m has been added by a pension fund
surplus.
