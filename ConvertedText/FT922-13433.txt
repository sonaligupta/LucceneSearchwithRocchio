FT  11 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Garden planning


MY father-in-law died recently, leaving deeds of a small garden in the joint
tenancy of himself and his widow. The widow is 87, so the title of this land
will obviously pass to someone else. To facilitate the transfer of this land
by gift or sale will it be sufficient merely to place my father-in-law's
death certificate with the deeds, indicating that the widow is the sole
owner? Or will it be necessary to complete other formalities? There will be
no inheritance tax to pay, as the estate is small.
What you suggest will be adequate to establish the title of the surviving
joint tenant provided that there has been no severance of the joint tenancy
during the lifetime of your father-in-law.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the
answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as
soon as possible.
