FT  27 MAY 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


On the London bullion market GOLD failed to build on overnight gains in New
York, and lost ground on trade selling in Europe. Dealers said that the US
funds did not seem interested in buying in New York, even on the dips down
to Dollars 370 a troy ounce. Without fund buying, a bout of trade selling in
Europe was enough to weaken the price. Three-month COPPER hit profit taking
and technical resistance between Dollars 1,850 and Dollars 1,860 a tonne on
the LME, and prices eased. Technically, the market is still trading within a
band between Dollars 1,820 and Dollars 1,850, dealers said. ALUMINIUM perked
up in late kerb trade, aided by news that unions involved in Alcoa and
Reynolds Metals talks had voted to authorise possible strikes. But traders
say a strike is unlikely, and as hedge cover has been put in place, the
market is more likely to ease if new labour contracts are agreed. London
COCOA futures continued to drift in a narrow band with the market still
hovering just above a recent seven-month low. There was little reaction to
ED & F. Man's increased deficit forecast for 1992-93 to 124,000 tonnes from
a March estimate of 118,000 tonnes.
