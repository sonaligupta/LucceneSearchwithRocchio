FT  13 NOV 93 / EU forces Bundesbank rethink


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


THE Bundesbank will have to adopt alternative methods of fine-tuning German
money market interest rates when, as is probable, it abandons its Paragraph
17 facility early next year.
Under Paragraph 17, government funds deposited in non-interest bearing
accounts at the Bundesbank are injected into the money market at market
rates to ease temporary liquidity shortages.
The facility is now threatened with abolition because of stipulations in the
Maastricht Treaty for European Monetary Union that ban the use of central
bank credits to finance national budgets during the second stage of EMU,
which takes effect on January 1, 1994.
German public authorities currently must deposit funds free of interest with
the Bundesbank in return for short-term cash credits from the central bank.
But once cash credits are banned, those deposits will no longer be
mandatory. As a result, authorities will be able to invest their money more
lucratively elsewhere, removing the pool of public funds hitherto available
for Paragraph 17 operations.
These changes pose two challenges to the German authorities. The government
is given an opportunity to find a more lucrative home for its funds in
short-term money market instruments or on accounts with
government-affiliated credit institutions, such as Kredit fur Wiederaufbau.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank must find another flexible instrument for
fine-tuning its money market operations. 'A similarly fast and
well-targetted arrow ..is hard to find,' noted Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt.
Mr Remsperger suggested the Bundesbank could intensify the use of other
tools, such as currency swaps, 'fast repos' (unscheduled tenders for funds
against securities which have to be repurchased within a few days) or
so-called 'lightning repos', like fast repos but targetted at a handful of
banks.
