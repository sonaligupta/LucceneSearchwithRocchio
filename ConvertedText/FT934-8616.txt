FT  15 NOV 93 / Threat of prison lock-out recedes


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


THREATENED industrial action in English and Welsh prisons today over the
government's market testing programme appeared to be receding last night.
The Prison Officers Association had told its members to refuse to admit new
prisoners brought to prisons today by the police or Group 4, the private
court escort company. This would have led to between 500 and 1,000 prisoners
having to be accommodated in police cells.
But Prison Service officials said yesterday that prison governors had
received indications from local union representatives that prisoners would
be admitted as usual. If this proves to be the case there will be early
talks between Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, and
union representatives.
Mr Brian Caton, national vice-chairman of the association, said, however,
that the action would go ahead and be stepped up next week to three days.
A ballot of association members favoured limited industrial action over the
market-testing programme, which will extend the number of prisons managed by
the private sector. The union is also protesting about the transfer of
support tasks to civilian staff and prison violence.
