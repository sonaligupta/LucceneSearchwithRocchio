FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Divided over
UK equities - The Professionals / Our four managers still disagree about
market prospects, and one has opted strongly for gilts


   By PHILIP COGGAN


A substantial switch from equities into bonds by Gartmore Investment
Managment is the most striking move by our four professional fund managers,
at the end of a turbulent nine months on financial markets.
Paul Myners, of Gartmore, is moving from a portfolio split 90/10 in favour
of equities versus bonds to one with a 70/30 mix. He cites stretched equity
valuations and pessimism about corporate profits as the reasons.
Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford, is also cautious about the outlook
for equities and is moving to a 30 per cent weighting in bonds and cash.
Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Managment, has only a 16 per cent
weight in bonds and cash and is rather more upbeat about equities. He thinks
equity markets 'will now consolidate and pave the way for higher levels at
the year end.'
In contrast to the other three, Tim Howe, of Singer & Friedlander, owns no
conventional bonds at all - only some index-linked gilts. 'We have retained
our major exposure to the UK equity market, because it increasingly
represents fundamental value as earnings and dividends increase,' he says.
Howard Beaufort: 'A sharp rise in bond yields, following the unwinding of
speculative trading positions, has depressed investor confidence. Falling
leaves, it seems, are too often accompanied in investors' minds by fears of
falling financial markets.
'The economic background favours a reversal in investor sentiment, but,
given the cautious mood, this probably requires a further accumulation of
evidence that economic recovery and renewed growth will not lead
automatically to higher levels of inflation.
'To the ordinary investor, the financial planet must often seem an
upside-down world. While the economic recovery is cause for some rejoicing
by the populace in the streets: in the financial alleyways, it is seen only
as a cause for unmitigated wailing and gnashing of teeth.
'For our part, we continue to believe that this year's declines in financial
markets are an inevitable correction following the substantial rises of the
past three years, and that the peak in both short-term interest rates and
inflation will prove lower than in previous economic cycles.' Beaufort is
happy to buy soundly-based bond markets and quality equities.
Douglas McDougall: 'Three months ago, we expressed continued caution about
the outlook for equities, and maintained our relatively high cash balance of
15 per cent.
'The most striking feature of financial markets this year has been the
weakness of bonds and the high levels of real long-term interest rates. The
original cause of the rise in yields was probably the need for a change to a
tighter monetary policy in the US, and contributing factors have been the
strength of the global economy, the high levels of government borrowing and
the speculative positions built up in the bond market boom in 1993.
'Inflation is likely to push up soon but will probably fall short of the
levels reached in recent cycles, partly because of the discipline exercised
on governments by bond and currency markets.
'Bond yields are close to their highs, though they may be slow to fall.
Current yields offer strong competition for equities, which in most markets
are quite highly valued by historical standards and assume a more extended
period of profit growth than is likely to be achieved.
'We are making no change to our distribution. We shall continue with
relatively high holdings of bonds and cash, and give priority within the
equity portfolio to the UK.'
Paul Myners: 'We hinted last quarter that the nimble investor may be better
off in bonds at some point. Given the continued outperformance by equities,
it is now time to change our portfolio.'
Myners cites two main reasons for the switch. 'First, the relationships
between bonds and equities are now looking stretched. Second, investors are
probably overestimating the profit potential of companies in a
disinflationary environment. But in an environment where prices are not
rising, further increases in profits will be restricted.
'Central to this thesis is our view that inflation will not accelerate
unduly. It will clearly rise from the current low level, but the
disinflationary forces are at work.
'Our central case for equities is not bearish. We hope that the anomaly we
perceive between equities and bonds will be corrected by bonds recovering.
There is a risk, however, that this recovery is delayed, and this would
undoubtedly take its toll on equity prices, with setbacks of 15 per cent
being possible.
Myners is selling a 10 per cent weighting in UK equities and putting the
proceeds into long gilts. He is also moving 10 per cent into US dollar
bonds, raising funds by selling a 5 per cent holding in continental European
equities, 2.5 per cent in US smaller company stocks and 2.5 per cent in
Japanese equities. He is diversifying his 5 per cent holding in Mexico
across the whole of Latin America.
Tim Howe: 'The increasing inter-dependence of the world's financial markets
is amply demonstrated by the attention being given to US monetary policy.
The ongoing strength of the US economy is increasing pressure on the Fed to
raise interest rates again, thus undermining recovery prospects for US
bonds. Against this background, US equities look set to struggle as monetary
conditions harden. European equities look better value in the light of the
substantial scope for higher profits as recovery gathers pace.
'The depth of the Japanese recession will ensure that monetary policy
remains relaxed. The performance of the Japanese equity market has been
disappointing over the last quarter, but the bull case for substantial
appreciation remains.
'Public perception of the UK's economic performance will continue to
improve, but sentiment in financial markets is affected by fears prevailing
on Wall Street.
'Over three-quarters of our portfolio is invested in the UK, and this
represents a bet on a continuation of last quarter's sterling strength. The
major changes in investment policy have been overseas, where we have reduced
exposure to the US and Japan and increased our investment in the emerging
markets and commodity producers.'
