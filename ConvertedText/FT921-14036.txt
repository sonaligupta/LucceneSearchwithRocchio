FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: Culture gulf


Henry V would have turned in his grave when the war against Iraq began on
the morning of January 17 last year, according to the man who commanded
Britain's naval forces in the Gulf.
Commodore Christopher Craig told an audience at the Royal United Services
Institute yesterday how, shortly before the allied offensive, he asked
commanders in Riyadh for a codeword he might flash out to tell everybody
when 'the balloon had gone up'.
The word he requested was Agincourt. To his consternation, the response came
back: 'Use Walkman.'
