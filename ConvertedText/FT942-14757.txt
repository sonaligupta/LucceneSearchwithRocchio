FT  19 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Channel control overdue


   From Mr KEVIN SHILLETO


Sir, A month ago a 100,000 ton tanker was in collision in the Bosporus. More
recently, a 300,000 tonner spilled 7,000 tons of crude oil in the Straits of
Oman, after hitting a bunkering tanker. On March 31, there was a near miss
in the English Channel between a 22,000 ton super-ferry and a small
freighter.
What all these incidents have in common is their occurrence in confined
waters. A disaster of almost unimaginable proportions is well overdue off
Dover between a ferry carrying up to 2,000 passengers and a fully loaded
supertanker. If one vessel strikes the other, the ferry will sink in
minutes. All roll-on, roll-off ferries are simple cardboard boxes, open plan
on several decks without bulkheads and inherently unsafe when breached.
Traffic on cross-Channel routes has more than doubled since the Spirit of
Free Enterprise disaster but still no effective traffic control system such
as that operated by the Civil Aviation Authority exists, although satellite
scanning of the entire Channel is feasible. Official routing exists, but
monitoring each vessel in transit through or crossing the Channel cannot be
delayed. The British and French governments and the International Maritime
Organisation must be deemed dilatory to the point of fecklessness in this
regard.
