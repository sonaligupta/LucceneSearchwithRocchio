FT  16 JAN 92 / Arts: Mendelssohn Foundation


A Mendelssohn Foundation has been established in Leipzig, Germany, based at
the Gewandhaus, home of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Its first task
will be to rescue the Mendelssohn House, the composer's residence in
Leipzig, from years of neglect and threatened development as a hotel. The
Foundation plans instead to establish it as an international cultural
centre. The Royal Philharmonic Society, based in London, was invited to
become one of the founder members.
