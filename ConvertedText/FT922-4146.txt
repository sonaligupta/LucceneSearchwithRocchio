FT  06 JUN 92 / Docklands move plan arouses resistance


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


MORE than 1,000 civil servants from the Department of the Environment held
an angry meeting in London yesterday to protest against plans to move them
from Westminster to Docklands.
The meeting, organised by four Civil Service unions, heard calls for a
campaign - including industrial action - to stop the move.
'Hell, no, we won't go]' said one civil servant to loud applause, echoing
the slogan of US draft dodgers during the Vietnam War. Another demanded that
staff unwilling to move to Docklands should be found alternative work in
other Whitehall departments.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said on Tuesday that Canary
Wharf was among three sites under consideration for rehousing civil servants
from its Marsham Street headquarters which are due for demolition. The other
two are Harbour Exchange and East India Dock, both on the Isle of Dogs.
Speakers at the protest meeting queried the economics of the move. Mr Paul
Noon of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Scientists challenged
ministers to publish the figures that the government claimed showed
relocation to Docklands was good value for the taxpayer.
Another 3,000 civil servants are expected to join the Environment Department
staff in Docklands, from, among others, transport and radiocommunications.
