FT  22 DEC 92 / Letter: Real nature of council tendering dilemma


   From Mr TOM FLANAGAN


Sir, Could I help to clarify the uncertainty surrounding employee rights on
council tendering ('Disputes over employees' terms threaten council
tendering plans', December 16)? Contracts of employment must be preserved by
a successful tenderer if the EC Acquired Rights Directive or the Transfer of
Undertakings Regulations apply.
To date, the main preoccupation has been with the regulations' requirement
that the entity must be 'in the nature of a commercial venture'. This
requirement is not in the directive and is becoming irrelevant.
However, for either the directive or the regulations to apply, there must
still be an actual transfer of an existing economic entity.
This is a question of fact in every case, involving an analysis of what, if
anything, is being transferred. There is no ideal checklist.
The government's insistence that the regulations do not apply to competitive
tenders 'as a general rule' is just another way of saying that most
contracting out does not involve a transfer of anything. This is usually
correct. Therefore, neither the regulations not the directive should apply.
Nevertheless, the European Court of Justice is applying the directive when
it can and it is impossible to say that it will not apply it to more
contracting out situations.
I can understand the local authorities' dilemma and can suggest that if they
can show that they have made a reasoned decision that the regulations do not
apply, because there is no 'transfer' at all, then any resulting redundancy
payments should not be ultra vires.
