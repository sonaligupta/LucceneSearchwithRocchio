FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: David S Smith pleases market with 56% rise
 -Chairman forecasts strong year ahead as paper and packaging markets
recover across Europe


   By ANDREW BOLGER


Shares in David S Smith Holdings jumped by 22p to 550p after the paper,
packaging and office supplies group pleased the market with
better-than-expected results and a confident trading statement.
Pre-tax profits jumped by 56 per cent to Pounds 42.2m in the year to April
30, while turnover rose by 51 per cent to Pounds 783m.
Both increases were mainly due to a nine-month contribution from Spicers,
the UK's largest wholesaler of office products, bought for Pounds 93.5m last
year.
Mr Alan Clements, chairman, said: 'After three years of cautious statements
it is pleasing to be able to be more upbeat . . . The trends in our markets
are favourable and I am confident that the group will perform strongly in
the year ahead.'
Mr Peter Williams, chief executive, said Spicers wholesaling in the UK had
turned in an excellent performance, producing operating profits of Pounds
15.8m on sales of Pounds 242.5m, and showing growth of 9.5 per cent in a
recovering market.
Spicers' UK and Irish manufacturing operations were adversely affected by
low market prices, but a gradual improvement was expected in the coming
year.
In packaging and paper, total sales were Pounds 540m, up 4.1 per cent.
Operating profit slipped to Pounds 37m, down 2.9 per cent from the previous
year, reflecting a fall in margins from 7.3 to 6.8 per cent.
The group said the markets for its products had improved recently as the
recovery spread across Europe, bringing reasonable growth in most areas.
Packaging paper markets staged a particularly robust recovery with good
growth in demand and significant price increases. However, papermaking
margins had not reflected the full benefit due to a rapid escalation in
waste paper prices.
Similarly, although the group's packaging operations were generally enjoying
better volumes, they were faced with the problem of passing on the cost of
large paper price increases to their customers.
Gearing fell from 57 per cent to 37 per cent. Earnings per share increased
by 17 per cent to 25.2p (21.6p). A final dividend of 8p gives a total of
10.75p (10p), an increase of 7.5 per cent.
