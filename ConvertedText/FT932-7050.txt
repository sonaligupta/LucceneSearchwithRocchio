FT  26 MAY 93 / Introducers come under new Lautro rules


   By PHILIP COGGAN


THE Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation (Lautro) has
introduced new rules for introducers - those who bring together investors
and sales representatives - Philip Coggan writes.
Until now introducers have been governed by the same rules as sales
representatives even though they do not sell products or give advice.
The new rules state that introducers must make their status clear to
potential customers - that is, that they are acting on behalf of a
particular Lautro member and that they are not authorised to give advice.
Members of the regulatory organisation will be responsible for the actions
of their introducers and must keep records of their names and addresses.
