FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manganese Bronze clocks up Pounds 1.53m for
the year


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


MANGANESE BRONZE Hold-ings, the maker of London taxi cabs, returned to the
black in the year to end-July with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.53m, compared
with losses last time of Pounds 2.5m.
The shares closed 17p ahead at 114p.
Profits on continuing operations last year were Pounds 498,000. The loss was
struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 1.73m for the closure of the
Darlington foundry, which lost Pounds 898,000.
Mr Jamie Borwick, chief executive, said he was pleased with the results
relative to the previous year, but believed the group, which had an overall
turnover of Pounds 72.2m (Pounds 71.2m), could do better in future.
Profits in the vehicles division in particular could make a significant
contribution to profits in the coming year, he said. The division edged into
the black with Pounds 39,000 on turnover of Pounds 41m, compared with a
previous loss of Pounds 310,000 on turnover of Pounds 40.7m.
The turnround had been achieved through cost cutting and improved
efficiency. The group had been making 36 taxis a week since August 1 after
12 months of making only 32 vehicles a week. In 1990 it was making 60 taxis
a week.
Mr Borwick said the taxi business appeared to be coming out of recession. He
was confident that the taxi licensing review announced on Wednesday would
not be detrimental to sales.
The Deans Powered Doors division, which makes doors for buses and trains,
also returned to the black, making Pounds 2,000 on turnover of Pounds 6.1m,
compared with a loss of Pounds 1.24m on turnover of Pounds 4.9m. Mr Borwick
attributed the recovery to a new management team.
Profits in the components division, which supplies bearings and precision
castings to the automotive industry, eased from Pounds 2.04m to Pounds
1.81m, on turnover up from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 25.1m.
Total net interest paid dipped from Pounds 327,000 to Pounds 320,000.
Earnings per share were 6.04p (12.27p loss). A final dividend of 2p is
proposed, giving a total for the year of 2.5p (1p).
