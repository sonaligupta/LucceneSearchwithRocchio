FT  08 JUN 92 / Lebanese economy weakens


   By LARA MARLOWE

The Lebanese economy deteriorated sharply in the first third of 1992, the
Beirut Chamber of Commerce and Industry reported at the weekend, writes Lara
Marlowe in Beirut.
Researchers cited decreased activity in most economic sectors, capital
flight after a wave of rumours about some banks, postponement of foreign
reconstruction aid and a fall in the value of the Lebanese pound. Bank
deposits in Lebanon fell to Dollars 5.8bn in March compared with Dollars
6.2bn in March 1991. The central bank's foreign exchange reserves, which
stood at Dollars 1.234bn at the end of last year, fell to Dollars 690m in
March because the bank had tried to shore up the Lebanese pound.
