FT  15 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BET active


   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Turnover in business services group BET rose to a hefty 13m, its highest
daily total for more than six months after the board confirmed market
expectations of a cut in the final dividend.
Total dividend for the year to March 1993 is to be 3.25p, compared with 6.5p
last year. Losses were sharply reduced to Pounds 9.8m, against Pounds
448.4m.
With the dividend cut already discounted by many in the market the shares,
after dipping to 103p, rose to end a net 3 ahead at 111p, assisted by the
strong market trend and a robust presentation. Analysts, however, remain
sceptical about prospects for profits growth this year and one said: 'The
jury is still out on this one even though the management has done all the
right things to restructure the company.'
Modest, if unremarkable, confidence surrounded most food companies.
Cadbury-Schweppes enjoyed the added filip of favourable weekend press
comment to move up 6 to 465p, having fallen back from a high of 469p in a
volume of 2.9m. Unilever put on 13 to close at 1044p and Dalgety added 7 to
reach 450p. United Biscuits increased its price by 1 to 389p while Kwik Save
slid the opposite way to lose 4 at 736p after a sell note.
The official launch in the US of its anti-inflammatory asthma drug Tilade
triggered a surge of exceptionally heavy activity in Fisons shares.
Turnover of 11m was the heaviest single-day's business in the stock since
early-April when the Fisons share price tumbled almost 13 per cent after the
company cancelled further development work on another asthma drug,
Tipredane.
Fisons' stock price touched 163p early in the session before slipping back
to finish 6 1/2 higher on balance at 161 1/2 p.
As well as the buying prompted by Tilade's US launch, dealers said there
remained a strong undercurrent of takeover speculation surrounding Fisons,
which last week dropped out of the prestigious FT-SE 100 Index. Prominent
among a number of big names said to be monitoring Fisons' progress is
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group. SmitKline 'A'
moved up 6 1/2 to 436p on good turnover of 1.9m.
BT shares gave a positive response to news of the pricing of the first and
second instalments of the BT3 issue along with details of investor
incentives. The shares forged ahead 10 1/2 to 423 1/2 p on turnover of 5.9m
as the hardcore marketing of the issue to international and domestic
investors got under way.
Fall-out from the DIY price battle was blamed for the decline, against the
day's trend, in Kingfisher shares from 590p to 586p. Kingfisher, which owns
the B&Q chain, was pitted against an aggressive pricing campaign from Texas
Homecare over the weekend.
Analysts also fear for the long term health of DIY - especially after
Ladbroke Group yesterday told its shareholders that Texas's performance had
disappointed in recent weeks.
'The underlying trend is pretty weak,' said one stores specialist.
The combination of tough pricing and fears for overall DIY strength is a
potent one for Kingfisher, which is estimated to derive 35 per cent of its
profits from DIY. Another analyst said the dip was also partly attributable
to a general slide in consumer spending.
Elsewhere in companies with a DIY interest, WH Smith 'A' slipped 4 to 439p
and Boots, which shares the Do It All venture with Smith, relinquished 2 at
435p.
Hefty switching out of Barclays and into National Westminster saw the latter
move ahead 7 to 475p and the former ease 2 to 465p. Vague bid speculation
continued to drive TSB, which closed 4 harder at 195p on 5.5m traded.
A Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation triggered keen demand for Commercial
Union, 11 stronger at 597p.
East Midlands Electricity, the first of the regional electricity companies
to report preliminary results, set a high standard by lifting the dividend
by 14 per cent. The shares climbed 6 to 456p. Specialists said the 'recs'
offered much less regulatory risk than other utilities.
North West Water shot up 16 to 468p as marketmakers scrambled to cover short
positions and to accommodate special cum scrip dividend buying.
After seeing light trading, property companies fell victim to some
nervousness in the final hour or so of the market. British Land retreated 9
to finish at 311p and MEPC lost 3 to 422p.
British Gas shrugged off worries about the recent weakness in oil prices and
moved up 4 1/2 to 297p following a buy recommendation issued by Kleinwort
Benson Securities. Turnover in the stock reached 4.7m shares.
Kleinwort's oil and gas team said fears over the forthcoming Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report 'are already discounted', pointing to the yield
relative which is close to a five-year high.
'Unregulated upstream assets are set to provide significant growth, leading
to a progressive rerating of the shares which, on a 6 per cent-plus yield,
are attractive,' Kleinwort said.
Bass moved ahead 21 to 488p and Allied-Lyons rose 15 to 545, both in
moderate dealings. After falling back slightly towards the end of trading,
Grand Metropolitan put on 7 at 418p in a volume of 2.4m.
