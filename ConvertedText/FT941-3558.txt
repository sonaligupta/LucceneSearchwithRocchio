FT  16 MAR 94 / Russia to export 2m tonnes of grain


   By REUTER


   MOSCOW


Russia will not only cut grain imports to a minimum this year, but intends
to export 2m tonnes, the deputy agriculture minister, Mr Vladimir Shcherbak,
told a government commission meeting, Reuter reports from Moscow.
RIA news agency quoted him as saying domestic supplies were sufficient to
meet most demand, but there would still have to be some small imports of
certain types of grain.
These should include 100,000 tonnes of corn seed, already covered by
preliminary agreements and waiting in western ports to be delivered, Mr
Shcherbak said. But foreign companies were seeking finance ministry payment
guarantees before making shipments, and the agreements could still fall
through, he said.
Russia imported about 11m tonnes of grain in 1993, down from 25m tonnes in
the previous year.
Mr Shcherbak gave no details of the planned exports.
