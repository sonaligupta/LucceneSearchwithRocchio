Barlo Group, the Dublin-based radiator and plastics manufacturer, achieved a
rise in profits from IPounds 390,000 to IPounds 2.42m, or Pounds 2.29m, for
the six months ended September 30.
Turnover expanded from IPounds 15.1m to IPounds 43.4m, of which the core
activities contributed 36 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Operating
margins improved from 4.1 per cent to 7 per cent.
Earnings emerged at 1.76p (0.46p) and interim dividends are being resumed
via a 0.4p payment.
The results included a positive contribution from Veha, a Belgian radiator
maker acquired in July, and a full six months' contribution from the
plastics division compared with just two months in 1992.
