FT  12 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Dollar slides


   By PHILIP GAWITH


The dollar continued its slide on foreign exchanges yesterday to touch its
lowest level in four months, writes Philip Gawith.
The US currency continues to suffer from the political fallout of the
Whitewater scandal and closed in London at DM1.6779, down from DM1.6893 on
Thursday.
Further undermining the dollar was an upward revision in Germany's January
M3 figure, to an annualised 21.2 per cent from 20.6 per cent, which could
slow the decline in German interest rates.
Sterling was also weaker, pulled down by the dollar and worse than
anticipated December trade figures. The trade weighted index fell to 80.5
from 81.
The dollar fell yesterday when the Commerce Department reported February US
retail sales rose 1.5 per cent after a downward revision in the January
figure to a 1.6 per cent decline. The figures cancelled each other out, but
the vulnerable dollar lost ground anyway.
Although the Bundesbank deputy president Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said the
upward revision of German M3 figures was 'economically insignificant', it
did cause heavy selling pressure on the dollar.
The dollar closed slightly weaker against the yen at Y105.125 from Y105.695
on Thursday. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said
the Bank of Japan continued to support the dollar when it fell below Y105. A
slight cooling of the trade dispute between the two countries had also taken
some pressure off the exchange rate.
Sterling fell by nearly a pfennig and a half to close at DM2.521 from
DM2.5364. Part of the weakness was attributable to weaker than expected
trade figures. The visible trade deficit rose to Pounds 1.57bn in December
from Pounds 1.28bn in November.
The trade figures, however, only gave added impetus to an already weak
sterling.
Mr Stuart Frost, technical analyst at Natwest Treasury, said the fall in
sterling was a 'dollar inspired move'. Going back to October, every time
sterling has reached the Dollars 1.50/1.51 level, it has been sold off.
This selling pressure then spills over into the Pounds /D-Mark rate too. He
said that when sterling breached the important DM2.53 support level - before
the trade figures were released - this had prompted aggressive selling from
technical operators.
Deteriorating sentiment about the interest rate outlook was also reflected
in the futures market. The June short sterling contract fell by five points
to 94.85, indicating that the market only anticipates a 10 basis point fall
in interest rates by the middle of the year.
Aggravating matters has been the strength of the D-Mark which has firmed on
the perception that the Bundesbank will only cut rates slowly.
The D-Mark had a quiet day in Europe ending marginally weaker against the
French franc at FFr3.402 from FFr3.404. It was stronger against the Italian
lira, finishing at L990.9 from L990.1
Liquidity conditions in the discount market were fairly easy with the
overnight rate fluctuating between 3 3/4 per cent and 6 per cent. The Bank
put Pounds 1.112bn liquidity into the system compared to its forecast of a
Pounds 1.45bn shortage, revised up from Pounds 1.35bn.
