FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: National Australia Bank in
property tender plan


   By BRUCE JACQUES

NATIONAL Australia Bank, the Australian financial services group, plans a
sealed bid tender programme to sell about ADollars 143m (USDollars 97m)
worth of commercial and residential property.
Under the plan, the first time such a system has been used, the bank will
offer for sale 41 properties throughout Australia, which it holds as
mortgagee in possession.
If successful, the tender strategy may prove attractive to other major
Australian banks which have combined problem property loans of more than
ADollars 10bn, although only some of these are held as mortgagee in
possession.
The obvious advantage of the tender process to the NAB is an increased
possibility of selling properties en masse rather than piecemeal. Mr Michael
Johnstone, group manager of the NAB's property finance division, believes
the process has advantages for potential buyers.
He said properties had appraised values varying between ADollars 400,000 and
ADollars 16.2m, with estimated yields ranging from 13 to 21 per cent.
