Most of the main companies associated with Hyundai, one of South Korea's
leading business groups, reported higher profits and sales for 1993,
although several of its smaller concerns recorded losses.
Hyundai Corporation, the group's trading arm, reported that net earnings
rose by 3.7 per cent to Won5.45bn (Dollars 6.7m), although sales fell by 1.6
per cent to Won11,000bn as overseas shipments were disrupted by strikes
affecting several Hyundai companies last summer.
Hyundai Motor, the nation's largest car manufacturer, had a 39 per cent
increase in net profits to Won58.2bn as sales rose by 18 per cent to
Won7,180bn due to strong exports benefiting from a weak Korean Won.
The domestic car sales division, Hyundai Motor Service, suffered a 32 per
cent drop in net profits to Won17.3bn as low-interest consumer financing
offered by the company to boost sales put pressure on earnings. Sales
increased by 20.9 per cent to Won3,903bn.
Hyundai Engineering and Construction had a 9 per cent increase in earnings
to Won20.7bn as sales rose by 3 per cent to Won2,774bn.
South Korea's largest shipbuilder, Hyundai Heavy Industries, reported that
net profits declined by 21 per cent to Won221bn in 1993 as sales fell by 12
per cent to Won2,170bn.
The results reflected lower profit margins on ships ordered in 1992 and
delivered last year. Industrial disputes at the shipyard last summer also
depressed sales.
However, HHI, which is seeking a listing on the Seoul bourse, remains the
subsidiary with the largest profits in the Hyundai group.
Hyundai Precision & Industry, the world's leading container manufacturer,
had a loss of Won48.9bn in 1993 against a profit of Won5.5bn in 1992 due to
a drop in exports. Sales, however, increased by 6.3 per cent to Won1,340bn.
Inchon Iron & Steel had a 20.5 per cent fall in profits to Won11.5bn,
although sales rose by 18 per cent to Won1,083bn. It blamed the earnings
decline on a rise in the international prices for scrap steel.
Hyundai Pipe, the nation's largest steel pipe maker, had a loss of Won4.9bn
against a profit of Won1.2bn in 1992. It blamed the earnings drop on price
competition from manufacturers in developing nations. Sales increased by 24
per cent to Won321bn.
Hyundai Wood Industries, a timber and furniture company, had a loss of
Won4.5bn against a profit of Won1.9bn in 1992. Sales rose by 22.6 per cent
to Won397bn. Keum-Kang Development, an owner of department stores and
hotels, took a loss of Won4.9bn against a profit of Won3bn in 1992.
