FT  02 JUL 92 / Hammersmith Odeon in takeover deal


Changing tune: Hammersmith Odeon, one of London's most famous popular music
venues, will be transformed later this year in a Pounds 4m takeover deal.
Rank Organisation has sold the building to Apollo Leisure and the venue,
which celebrates its diamond anniversary this year, closes at the end of
July. It will be refurbished before reopening under its new name, the
Hammersmith Apollo. The entertainment company also owns London's Apollo
Victoria Theatre and has an interest in The Dominion. Mr Paul Gregg,
managing director, said yesterday: 'We intend to broaden its appeal beyond a
concert venue. It can accommodate more than just rock concerts, although we
want to carry on attracting the major artistes.' The group has a chain of
theatres, cinemas, hotels, bingo and social clubs as well as concert venues.
