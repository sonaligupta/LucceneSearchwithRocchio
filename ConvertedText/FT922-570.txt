FT  26 JUN 92 / Observer: On the ball


If EC eminences at today's European summit see Danish foreign minister Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen and Germany's Chancellor Kohl seated side by side with their
heads together, it should not be concluded that they are forging some
threatening alliance. Quite the contrary.
Ellemann-Jensen, an ardent soccer fan, is taking a pocket-sized TV set with
him so as to watch the final of the European football championships between
Denmark and Germany. 'I'm quite sure Helmut Kohl, who'll be sitting next to
me, will be just as interested as I am,' he says.
