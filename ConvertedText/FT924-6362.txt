demand

KYOCERA, the leading Japanese maker of ceramic packages for integrated
circuits, suffered a 30.1 per cent earnings fall due to sluggish demand and
foreign exchange losses.
Consolidated pre-tax profits for the first half to September fell to Y24bn
(Dollars 195m) from Y34.4bn the previous year. Sales declined 6.9 per cent
to Y215.5bn, while after-tax profits fell 23.9 per cent to Y12bn.
Kyocera's profits were hurt by foreign exchange losses totalling Y1.9bn due
to appreciation of the yen. Sluggish demand from vehicle manufacturers and
office equipment manufacturers also hit sales.
The electronic parts division saw a 1.1 fall in sales to Y79.6bn, while
semiconductor components sales plunged 14.7 per cent to Y47.6bn. Electronic
equipment sales also declined, by 11.1 per cent to Y28.6bn.
On a parent company basis, Kyocera suffered a 16.3 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Y18.3bn, while sales fell 9.1 per cent to Y148.1bn.
For the full year to March, Kyocera hopes to boost profits on sales of its
new printer and new mobile telephones.
