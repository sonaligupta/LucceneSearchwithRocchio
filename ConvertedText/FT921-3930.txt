FT  12 MAR 92 / World Trade News: AEG forms joint venture with Czech
transport group

   PRAGUE


AEG, the subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, and Siemens, the German electronics
company, are to compete in the Czechoslovak domestic market, following a
joint venture set up between AEG and the country's biggest transport and
engineering company.
AEG is poised to acquire a majority ownership of the transport division of
the local company CKD for an undisclosed sum, following approval recently
granted by the Czech government. AEG intends to diversify CKD's production
of tramcars and diesel electric locomotives, and make subway cars, suburban
trains and trolley buses. Earlier this year Siemens acquired a 51 per cent
stake in the transport division of Skoda, the Plzen-based engineering group.
The joint venture also intends to focus on mass transit contracts.
Mr Bernhard Weiss, a Siemens manager responsible for the joint venture, said
Siemens and Skoda won in December a contract to supply the Prague metro with
22 new trains. The business should compensate for losses made by Skoda's
transport division because of problems in selling its locomotives on the
Soviet market. CKD is the largest producer of public transport vehicles in
Czechoslovakia, with 1991 sales of Korunas 14.9bn (Pounds 296m).
