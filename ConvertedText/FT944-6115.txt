FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Anglo American rises to R794m
midway

A broadly-based improvement in both trading and investment income helped
Anglo American Corporation, the world's biggest gold producer, to announce a
27 per cent increase in attributable earnings to R794m (Dollars 189m) for
the six months to September, up from R629m a year earlier.
Pre-tax profits rose 29 per cent to R1.23bn from R959m and earnings per
share to 341 cents from 270 cents.
The interim dividend was increased to 110 cents from 95 cents previously.
Investment income remained the biggest contributor to earnings, rising 20
per cent to R828m as the company benefited from higher dividends from mining
financial and gold interests. At the same time, an improved export
performance and good working cost containment in coal mining subsidiary
Amcoal helped trading income to improve by 24 per cent to R265m from R201m.
The company greatly improved its surplus on the realisation of investments
to R149m, up 96 per cent from last year. This was a result of the purchase
of the group's interest in Argus Newspapers by Irish publisher Mr Tony
O'Reilly and the sale of some gold holdings.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was greatly encouraged by the
economic upturn in the South African economy, noting it was driven by
investment rather than consumption for the first time in decades, and
expected the company to continue its improved performance over the next six
months.
However, he warned that labour regulations which prevented work on mines on
Sundays and granted excessive public holidays could severely damage the
industry's international competitiveness.
'If South Africa is to be internationally competitive, it cannot at this
stage of its development adopt the labour practices of the world's richest
and most productive countries,' he said.
