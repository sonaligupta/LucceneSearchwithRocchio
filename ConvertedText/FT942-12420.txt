FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Charles Sidney in Pounds 3m purchase


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and
passenger car dealer spun off by Albert Fisher last year, is paying Pounds
3.1m cash for the Aberdeen and Dundee Motor Group.
The vendor is Motherwell Bridge Holdings, one of the largest privately-owned
engineering companies in Scotland.
Charles Sidney also reported a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds
1.3m for the six months to February 28 on turnover ahead 8 per cent at
Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.71m).
Operating profits were flat at Pounds 1.25m after charging additional
central costs of Pounds 165,000. Profits at the pre-tax level were boosted
by Pounds 46,000 of interest receipts compared with Pounds 12,000 of
interest costs a year earlier.
Mr Raymond Edwards, chairman, said 'performance in our first six months as a
public company was in line with our expectations'.
Earnings per share slipped to 3.9p (4p), mainly reflecting low returns from
holding the new money raised at the time of flotation on deposit during the
period. A maiden interim divided of 1.2p is declared. The acquisition marks
the first step in Sidney's growth strategy set out at the time of flotation
in November.
As well as expanding the group's geographic coverage, which is particularly
important for the truck fleet market, the deal will increase trucks and car
unit sales by about 20 per cent.
Aberdeen and Dundee Motor operates Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle
franchises in Aberdeen and Dundee and the Mercedes-Benz passenger car
franchise in Dundee.
Last year the operations returned profits of Pounds 469,000 before interest,
group management charges of Pounds 146,000 and tax.
