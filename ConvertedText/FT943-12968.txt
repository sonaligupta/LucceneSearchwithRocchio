FT  22 JUL 94 / Privatisation programme hit


   By RAYMOND COLITT


   QUITO


The Ecuadorian government has suffered a severe blow to its privatisation
programme with parliament's rejection of a bill to allow the sale of shares
in the state telephone company, Emetel, which is worth an estimated Dollars
1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn), Raymond Colitt writes from Quito. Opposition parties
claimed the reform was unconstitutional, since the constitution says the
telecommunications sector should be controlled by the state because of its
strategic importance to the economy.
The state modernisation body, Conam, insisted that reform efforts would
continue despite the defeat. Ecuador's privatisation programme has been
criticised for poor management and under-pricing. However, the latest
setback comes only a week after the successful sale of the country's second
largest cement company, Cementos Selva Alegre.
