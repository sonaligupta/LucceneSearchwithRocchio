FT  30 APR 94 / Unilever takes Procter to court in row over 'super'
detergent


   By TONY JACKSON


The soap wars between Unilever and Procter & Gamble spilled into the courts
yesterday as Unilever took legal action to stop Procter making 'untruthful
and misleading' statements about its new generation of detergents.
The dispute between the world's two biggest detergents makers was sparked by
alleged claims from a Procter executive in the Dutch press that Unilever's
new super-concentrated detergents damaged clothes. The products, being
launched across Europe at a cost of several hundred million pounds, are
claimed by Unilever to represent a technological breakthrough. They are also
a vigorous attempt by Unilever to regain ground in the Pounds 6bn European
detergents market. It has lost market share to Procter over the past five
years.
Unilever's subsidiary Lever Nederland has started proceedings in the Dutch
courts on the basis that Procter's statements are 'sowing doubt amongst the
general public' about Omo Power, the Dutch brand name of the new detergent.
It is also seeking an injunction to stop Procter using the term 'Power' for
its own products. Procter is accused of putting stickers with the word
'Power' on its rival brand, Ariel, in a move which a Unilever source
described as 'particularly grubby'.
Procter said: 'This lawsuit is an attempt to silence the debate, but we see
it as an opportunity to bring all the facts into the open. We think the
charges are unfounded and we are confident that we will win the lawsuit.'
Unilever claimed that sales of the new product in the Netherlands were going
well despite wide publicity caused by the first appearance of Procter's
claims on Wednesday.
