FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: MFI fails to dispel retail gloom with
Pounds 29m


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


MFI, the furniture retailer and manufacturer, failed to dispel the gloom in
the retail sector yesterday when it reported interim profits at the bottom
end of expectations thanks to a squeeze on gross margins.
Pre-tax profits for the 28 weeks to November 12 rose from Pounds 24.5m -
excluding a Pounds 19.6m exceptional gain on the sale of MFI's stake in
Carpetright - to Pounds 29m. With analysts forecasting up to Pounds 39m, the
shares fell 2 1/2 p to 122p.
The problem was not on the sales side - UK retail sales increased 12 per
cent, while group turnover increased 13 per cent to Pounds 363m (Pounds
320m). Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said the trend had been maintained in the
second half.
'There is no doom and gloom here,' he added, referring to reports of
disappointing high street sales. 'Last year at this time we were 3 per cent
ahead.'
MFI revealed, however, that gross margins had fallen from 55.6 per cent to
52.9 per cent.
Ms Sue Murphy, finance director, said that resulted from a fall in the
proportion of MFI-manufactured goods sold from 55 to 52 per cent, and the
Pounds 3m cost of installing new ranges in stores. The group was also having
difficulty passing on to consumers price increases for raw materials such as
paper, chipboard, chemicals, and plastics.
With operating profits up 11.7 per cent from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 30.6m,
the group operating margin fell 0.2 points to 8.4 per cent. The effects of
the gross margin fall was offset by lower costs, but analysts were
disappointed by a 5.8 per cent increase in payroll costs.
The interim dividend was lifted to 1.5p (1.33p), with earnings per share up
from 2.78p - before exceptionals - to 3.3p.
Seven new UK stores have opened this year.
COMMENT
If MFI is still a barometer of the retail trade - it started suffering from
recession a year before other retailers - the outlook for the sector remains
blustery: sales growing nicely, but gross margins squeezed by rising raw
materials costs. MFI hopes to pass on more costs to consumers in the second
half. However, without recovery in the housing market, consumer durables
will remain highly competitive, limiting scope for price increases. It must
then rely on customers buying more products from its own factories.
Consensus full-year forecasts were trimmed to Pounds 80m, putting the shares
on a prospective multiple of 12.5, which looks fair given the margin
uncertainty.
