FT  25 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Japanese beers target US

JAPANESE beer makers hope to boost their market shares in the US, Europe and
Asia, Reuter reports from Tokyo. At present, Japanese exports account for
only a small fraction of the brew drunk around the world.
Japan's four biggest brewers, Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory, export
about 30,000 kilolitres of beer each year, but world beer consumption is
well over 100m kilolitres.
At the top of the Japan brewers' list of targets is the US. Imported beer
accounted for some 4-5 per cent of the 22.7m kilolitres Americans drank in
1990. Imports are about 2 per cent of the 6.6m-kilolitre Japan market.
Sapporo is leading the way in the US market, aiming at sales of 1.5m cases
in 1992, against 1.4m in 1991, Mr Kenzo Sakami, general manager, said.
Asahi aims to increase its US beer sales to 850,000 cases in 1992 from
700,000 cases a year earlier. Each case holds 12 bottles of 0.633 litres.
Kirin and Suntory have made a link-up with Canadian brewers. Molson, based
in Montreal, is now brewing Kirin beer for export to the US, where Kirin
expects to sell some 1.3m cases in 1992. The Toronto-based John Labatt
brewery started making Suntory's canned draught beer in February, and
Suntory aims to sell 200,000 cases in the first year in the US.
Japanese brewers are also eyeing the potentially lucrative European market.
Kirin is trying to strengthen its sales in Europe through a tie-up with
Britain's Charles Wells, which will make Kirin lager at its factory in
Bedford, starting in February 1993.
Charles Wells plans to brew 150,000 cases of Kirin in the first year and
300,000 cases a year by 1996.
The Japanese companies are also keen to expand in Asian countries such as
Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore, which have low import duties on beer.
