FT  14 APR 94 / A currency regime born from violence


The financial rand was first introduced to protect the country's reserves
after massive capital outflows followed a police massacre of black
protesters at Sharpeville in 1960.
Although it was scrapped in February 1983, the unit had to be re-introduced
in response to the upsurge in township violence that erupted in 1985. The
currency's previous low - before this week's collapse - was reached in
August of that year when the foreign exchange markets had to be temporarily
closed by the government after then President PW Botha's notorious Rubicon
speech that was supposed, but failed, to mark a no-return shift to reform of
apartheid.
In essence, financial rands comprise a pool of rands that can only be used
by foreign investors. They are created when a non-resident sells a South
African asset to a local investor. The payment is made in rand and deposited
in a local bank. It can only be used again by another non-resident in
exchange for foreign currency.
For all regular transactions on the current account the commercial rand, in
effect the country's trading currency, is used. In addition to acting as a
penalty against capital withdrawal, the financial rand also serves as an
incentive for new foreign investment because all yields are remitted in
commercial rands giving a greatly augmented return.
However, the currency has several obvious shortcomings, especially its
susceptibility to 'roundtripping' or illegal arbitrage between the two
units. Another problem is that the market is thinly traded and thus easily
moved by large orders, which is what happened on Monday.
Because of the financial rand's role as a foreign investment vehicle, the
South African Reserve Bank cannot support it. 'Its level is purely a
consequence of non-resident transactions,' says Mr James Cross, Reserve
(central) Bank general manager for foreign exchange.
