FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher recalls past triumphs


   By ROGER MATTHEWS


MRS MARGARET Thatcher spent more than an hour last night recalling the
virtues of her premiership - one of which she said was to have achieved a
budget surplus during the four final years.
Speaking to the party faithful in Knutsford, south of Manchester, Mrs
Thatcher reaffirmed her commitment to sound finances, balanced budgets and
the repayment of national debt.
Her statements sat uncomfortably alongside the continuing controversy over
Mr John Major's planned public sector borrowing requirement for next year of
Pounds 28bn.
Her message - although not apparently designed to embarrass her successor as
prime minister - was nonetheless applicable to both main parties.
It was very easy, she said, for governments to borrow money - but all
political promises had to be paid for. Every family, every company and every
country should live within its means. The alternative was to borrow, with
all the implications that had for interest rates and the development of
industry.
Thatcherism had rolled back the socialist commitment to spend, spend, spend,
its originator claimed.
She jousted with or slayed other familiar dragons along the way. Mr Jacques
Delors, General Galtieri, President Saddam Hussein, trade unions, and world
communism were past or continuing targets. The character of the British
people, freedom of choice, personal responsibility and Mr Ronald Reagan were
hailed as ideals worthy of emulation. 'Britain still has something to
achieve in teaching other nations,' she concluded.
Her audience was enthusiastic was not ecstatic. There was perhaps just a bit
too much history, not enough about the present battle; more than a touch of
yesterday's woman.
