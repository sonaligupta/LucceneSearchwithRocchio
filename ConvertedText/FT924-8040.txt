FT  13 NOV 92 / BT tariff ruling


BRITISH Telecommunications has been forced to amend one of its tariffs
offering bulk discounts to business customers following pressure from Oftel,
the industry watchdog.
The tariff would have allowed customers to pool traffic from sites across
the country to obtain call discounts of up to 16 per cent.
