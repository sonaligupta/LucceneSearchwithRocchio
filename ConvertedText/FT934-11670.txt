FT  30 OCT 93 / US personal income, spending edge up


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


US personal income and spending rose modestly in September, but by
sufficient amounts to suggest that the current consumer-led economic
recovery is in no immediate jeopardy.
Additionally, the Chicago purchasing managers' index rose to 57 per cent
this month, compared with 54.4 per cent in September, pointing to further
steady growth in manufacturing.
The 0.2 per cent rise in personal income and the 0.3 per cent advance in
personal spending were much in line with market expectations.
Personal income had risen sharply by 1.3 per cent in August, but that in
good measure represented the recovery from the midwestern floods of the
previous month. Both figures are reasonably good auguries for the coming
Christmas shopping period.
On Thursday the government reported an encouraging 2.8 per cent real annual
advance in gross domestic product in the third quarter, a figure that would
have been 0.6 per cent higher but for the dislocation of the floods.
Economists are now predicting growth in the 4 per cent range for the final
quarter.
