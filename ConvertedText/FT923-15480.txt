FT  02 JUL 92 / Fears on company car tax plans


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


UK CARMAKERS and import-ers are concerned that Inland Revenue proposals for
restructuring company car taxation, expected to be published in the next few
days, will retain car-pricing bands to which the industry is opposed.
The review, which directly affects some 3m company car drivers, was ordered
by the chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, at the time of his March Budget.
Under the present system, the amount of tax payable by a company car user on
the benefit of the private use of the car is calculated according to a scale
involving engine capacity, age and purchase price.
The system has been criticised by the industry for a number of reasons. The
principal concern is that the two main price thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and
Pounds 29,000, above which the assessed tax benefit rises sharply, forces
manufacturers to produce market-distorting 'tax break specials' and
dis-advantages those companies such as Jaguar which specialise in the upper
end of the executive car sector.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders is sufficiently alarmed for
its president, Mr Colin Hope, to have warned the all-party Motor Industry
Group of MPs that 'no one would have gained anything' if a banding system
were retained.
Jaguar yesterday emphasised its opposition to the retention of banding,
saying it would remain discriminatory against executive and luxury car
specialists.
