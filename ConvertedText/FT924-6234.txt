FT  23 NOV 92 / Managing divorce between Moscow and Kiev


   By EDWARD BALLS


TRY AS they might to live independent existences, the economic fortunes of
the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union are inextricably linked.
Ukraine's economic policies have been driven largely by a desire to achieve
economic independence from Russia, culminating in its departure from the
rouble zone a fortnight ago. But Ukraine will have to reach some form of
co-operative monetary agreement with its Russian neighbour if its
market-oriented reform plan, announced last week, is to succeed.
Economic relations between Moscow and Kiev have become increasingly
acrimonious over the past year. Ukraine, like some other independent-minded
republic, has been issuing coupons for cash transactions. But it has also
been granting rouble credits to enterprises in order to pay their bills. The
result has been an enormous expansion in rouble credits, making control of
Russian inflation almost impossible. Since January, Ukraine has issued
unbacked credit totalling more than Rbs400bn, over Dollars 1.5bn at current
exchange rates, while its monthly inflation has risen to 30 per cent. As Mr
Jeffrey Sachs, who advises the Russian government, argues: 'There is no
realistic possibility of controlling credit in a system in which several
independent central banks each have the independent authority to issue
credit.'
The Russian central bank has taken an increasingly tough line. In June, it
began to limit the amount of trade finance it would grant for Russian
exports to other republics. In September, it effectively ejected Ukraine
from the rouble zone by refusing to accept any further payments from the
Ukrainian central bank. Finally, on November 12, the Ukrainian government
announced it was abandoning the rouble completely and planning a fully
independent currency.
Yet this monetary divorce will not solve the underlying problem which
plagues economic inter-republican relations: the high degree of
specialisation and economic interdependence within the former USSR. Russia
trades only 18 per cent of its total output with other republics. But
Ukraine is twice as exposed to inter-republican trade, while 10 of the
smaller republics have inter-republican trade ratios higher than 50 per
cent, as the chart shows. Moreover, the concentration of energy reserves in
Russia and the low level of energy prices previously set in the USSR, means
most of the republics have effectively been subsidised by Russia. If trade
flows are calculated using world energy prices, then most of the republics,
including Ukraine, would have large inter-republican trade deficits.
Already, as energy prices have risen, the republics' central banks have been
forced to create rouble credits to finance their growing trade deficits.
A separate Ukrainian currency will preclude this inflationary form of trade
finance. The risk is that Ukraine's trade with Russia will now collapse
completely. Russian exporters are unlikely to accept payment in a new,
non-convertible, and potentially highly inflationary currency. Nor will
Ukraine be able to earn sufficient convertible currency to finance trade
equal to a third of its total output.
One solution, exhaustively discussed in a recent book published jointly by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Royal Institute
of International Affairs, is an inter-republican payments union. Russian
exporters and importers would be paid in roubles from the Russian central
bank while the Ukrainian traders would be paid in the new Ukrainian
currency. Every few weeks, the trade balance between Russia and Ukraine
would be settled in hard currency at an agreed dollar or Ecu exchange rate,
perhaps with western financial support.
A payments union would allow Russia and Ukraine to run independent monetary
policies while preserving trade links and preventing a further collapse in
output. Ukrainian independence may make economic as well as political sense.
But a shift to autarky would be costly indeed.

All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series
and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting
the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown
in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective
exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted
indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government
and central bank sources.
