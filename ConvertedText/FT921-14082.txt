FT  17 JAN 92 / One-vote majority acquits Papandreou

A SPECIAL court early today acquitted Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Greek
former prime minister, of charges of involvement in a Dollars 200m
embezzlement scandal at the Bank of Crete.
However, his two co-defendants - Mr Dimitris Tsovolas, a former finance
minister, and Mr George Petsos, a former industry minister - were both found
guilty on charges of breach of trust.
The verdicts came after more than 15 hours of deliberation by 13 senior
judges, who remained divided. Mr Vassilis Kokkinos, court president, said
the decision to acquit Mr Papandreou was by a 7:6 majority.
He had faced three charges arising from the Bank of Crete scandal, uncovered
in 1988: breach of trust, taking a bribe, and accepting the proceeds of a
crime. The socialist former premier dismissed the proceedings as a political
conspiracy against him by the ruling conservatives. He had refused to attend
the court hearings.
Mr Papandreou watched on live television, at his home in the Athens suburb
of Ekali, the verdict being delivered. His son, Mr George Papandreou, a
socialist MP, expressed relief, but added: 'It's a complex and unpleasant
outcome because of the two convictions.'
A small crowd of supporters of Mr Papandreou's Pan-hellenic Socialist
Movement (Pasok), gathered outside the supreme court building, cheered when
his acquittal was announced.
The not-guilty verdict seems to ensure that political stability in Greece
will not be threatened, but the conviction of Mr Tsovolas, one of Pasok's
most popular MPs, is likely to provoke angry demonstrations by socialist
supporters.
Pasok officials said they would consider proposing a no-confidence motion
against the conservatives, who have a two-seat parliamentary majority.
Sentences on the two convicted men are expected in the next few days.
