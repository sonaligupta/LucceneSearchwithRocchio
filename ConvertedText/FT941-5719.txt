FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings at Mayne Nickless surge
30%


   By NIKKI TAIT


Increased earnings from its transportation and healthcare businesses more
than offset a decline in the security division for Melbourne-based Mayne
Nickless, and left the company posting a 30.1 per cent increase in net
operating profits before abnormals, in the six months to January 2.
Mayne said that it made ADollars 61.7m (USDollars 44.1m) in the period,
compared with ADollars 47.4m a year earlier. Sales rose by 4.1 per cent, to
ADollars 1.44bn, from ADollars 1.38bn previously, and earnings per share
before abnormals were up by 25.6 per cent, at 20.6 cents.
The most recent half-year, however, saw an ADollars 27.2m abnormal charge,
relating to a retrenchment programme at its Spanish Transportes Helguera
business (ADollars 9.5m), and a decision to pull out of the Italian express
freight market. The Bergaglio Trasporti operation was closed this month, and
cost associated with this accounts for the remaining ADollars 17.7m of the
charge.
The result of the abnormal charge was to reduce Mayne's bottom-line profit
to ADollars 34.5m, from ADollars 47.4m previously.
Within the three operating divisions, transportation - which includes the
Parceline business in the UK - saw a sharp 70.4 per cent improvement in
operating earnings, to ADollars 41.7m. This result was helped by the
acquisition of France Distribution System in early-1993.
Mayne said that the Australian and North American businesses put in better
results, and that the express freight operations in the UK 'performed
satisfactorily'.
The healthcare business pushed operating profits 15.2 per cent higher to
ADollars 24.3m.
