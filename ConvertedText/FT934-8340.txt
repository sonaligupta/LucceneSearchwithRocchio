FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume up to Pounds 1.6m


   By PETER PEARSE


AITKEN HUME International reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 871,000 to
Pounds 1.6m in the six months to September 30.
However, the banking group chose to highlight 'the profits on ordinary
activities for continuing operations' which emerged at Pounds 101,000,
against losses of Pounds 507,000 last time. Ms Jacky Beatson, group
financial controller, explained: 'This is as we are now' - just the private
banking side and some dormant companies.
Ms Beatson said that banking in the UK and the Channel Islands incurred
losses of Pounds 509,000 (Pounds 71,000), though this included provisions of
Pounds 425,000 in Aitken Hume Bank.
The corporate overhead shrank to Pounds 365,000 (Pounds 498,000) and
financial income grew sharply to Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 62,000). This income
derived from the Pounds 17.7m Aitken profited from the sale of National
Securities & Research Corporation being placed on deposit.
Discontinued operations - NSR - made profits of Pounds 781,000 (Pounds
1.38m) up to its sale in May. There was also an exceptional credit of Pounds
713,000 which was the excess of the profit from the NSR sale freed by the
requirement to reinstate goodwill of Pounds 17m previously written against
reserves.
The directors said that the profit on the NSR disposal would increase when
any further amounts are released from the tax escrow account now reduced to
Dollars 11.8m (Pounds 7.8m) by the absorption into the profit from the NSR
sale of one escrow account amounting to Dollars 2.9m, from which Aitken
gains Dollars 2.24m.
After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 341,000) earnings
emerged at 3.08p (0.83p) per share. Again there is no interim dividend.
Sir Peter Gadsden was yesterday appointed executive chairman, Mr Bill Brown
deputy chairman and Mr David V Griffith chief executive.
