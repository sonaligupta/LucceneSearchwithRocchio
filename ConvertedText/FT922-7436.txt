   By JAMES BUXTON


A GERMAN-backed company is investing Pounds 2.92m in a plant to manufacture
computer monitors for sale in continental Europe at Prestwick, Ayrshire,
Scotland, James Buxton writes.
The plant, which is starting with 63 employees and hopes to reach 500 in
three years time, is located in Prestwick's Freeport, a zone that offers
exporters exemptions from value added tax.
The company, European Monitors, is a joint venture between Escom Computer of
Germany and Data Technology Holdings of the UK. Escom, a privately owned
company based at Heppenheim, near Frankfurt, is one of the biggest
distributors and retailers in the German computer market as well as being a
manufacturer of personal computers.
