FT  23 JUL 93 / Letters to the Editor: Benefits of classifying woodland as
set-aside


   From Mr MARTIN LOWRY


Sir, James Buxton's article, 'When money grows on trees' (July 20), draws
attention to the difficulties of expanding Britain's afforested area in ways
that maintain the right balance between environmental benefits and economic
returns.
On Tuesday, the European Commission threw out an excellent opportunity to
help reach the correct balance when it refused to allow the UK's Farm
Woodland Scheme to count towards land which may be put into long-term
set-aside. This would give farmers an income from creating broad-leaf
woodland out of otherwise unused acres, and so contribute significantly to
the expansion of the country's forest cover - with all the associated
environmental and recreational advantages.
I have written to the EC Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development
urging him to rethink his decision.
If the concept of set-aside is to win broad public acceptance, it is
important that land going into the scheme is seen to bring wider community
benefits. The Farm Woodland Scheme - which combines landscape, ecological
and recreational elements - offers just such benefits. Unfortunately many
farmers have been holding back from participation in this valuable scheme
because of the current uncertainty about its relationship with set-aside.
I hope that our government will continue to press Brussels on this important
issue.
