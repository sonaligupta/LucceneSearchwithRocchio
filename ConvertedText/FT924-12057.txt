FT  22 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Regulators prepare for new
approach to conglomerates


   By RICHARD WATERS


SECURITIES watchdogs from around the world will next week unveil their views
on how financial conglomerates should be regulated, revealing a difference
in approach to that broadly favoured by banking regulators.
In a paper to be presented at the annual conference in London of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), the regulators
will outline a series of principles for overseeing diverse financial groups.
The regulation of such entities - which combine businesses regulated by
different agencies, as well as businesses which fall outside the scope of
regulation - remains one of the most vexed questions for financial
supervisors.
Banking regulators, through the Basle committee on banking supervision, have
opted for an approach based on consolidation of the various businesses in a
group, with a broad capital adequacy test applied to the group as a whole.
The securities regulators, on the other hand, will advocate a more
qualitative test, rather than this rigid consolidation process. This would
include assessments of such things as the management and structure of
financial conglomerates, with appropriate limits set on intra-group
exposures to try to limit any contagion between different parts of a group
if one part experienced difficulties.
The paper, produced by Iosco's technical committee, chaired by Mr Richard
Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is one of a
number of initiatives due to be announced at the Iosco meeting, which will
be attended by more than 500 securities regulators from around the world.
The regulators are also due to issue a statement on money laundering, which
will provide guidance for exchanges and broker-dealers on how to combat the
use of securities and futures markets to launder 'black' money.
They are also expected to endorse the auditing standards agreed by the
International Auditing Practices Committee.
