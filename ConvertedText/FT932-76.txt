FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette studies Renault


   By ALICE RAWSTHORN


MATRA-HACHETTE, the French defence electronics and media group, is keen to
participate in the French privatisation programme by taking stakes in the
Renault motor group and Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, Matra-Hachette chairman, said the group was actively
considering investment in Renault, with which it already has a joint venture
to produce the Espace luxury van.
'It's clear that the government sees us as an interesting investor,' said Mr
Lagardere at the shareholders' meeting of Lagardere Group, through which his
family controls Matra-Hachette. 'If Renault's management is favourable we
would be interested in participating in its privatisation.'
Matra-Hachette's interest comes at a time of intense speculation about a
merger between Renault and Volvo of Sweden. The French government is thought
to be trying to assemble a group of noyaux durs, or long-term strategic
investors, in Renault as a precursor to privatisation and to the merger.
The government has called on companies to act as noyaux durs for all the
privatisation candidates, as it did in the mid-1980s state share sales.
Societe Generale, the bank, and Alcatel-Alsthom, the electronics group, have
already indicated their interest.
IFIL, the Italian holding company linked to the Agnelli family, yesterday
also expressed its interest.
Mr Lagardere said Matra-Hachette might also invest in Aerospatiale, although
he saw its flotation as a longer-term prospect. Mr Edouard Balladur, the
French premier, has said that Aerospatiale was unlikely to be sold until
after 1995.
