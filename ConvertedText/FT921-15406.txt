FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Foresters on the defensive


   By BERNARD SIMON


CANADA'S FORESTRY industry has mounted a broad-based campaign in Europe to
counter increasingly virulent criticism of its environmental practices.
The pulp and paper producers have been stung by articles in, among others,
The Observer and National Geographic magazine, as well a critical letter
sent by Greenpeace last October to German buyers of Canadian forestry
products.
The companies, supported by the Canadian and British Columbian governments,
hope that their efforts will forestall protests and boycotts such as those
that crippled the Canadian fur industry in the 1980s.
Mr Howard Hart, president of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association (CPPA)
in Montreal, said yesterday that 'we recognise the potential for regulations
and public attitudes on environmental matters to become significant trade
barriers'.
Mr Allan Sinclair, vice-president of British Columbia's Council of Forest
Industries, said that producers were receiving 'occasional questions' from
customers who 'want reassurance that forests are being well managed for the
long run.'
The counter-measures range from visits by customers, journalists and
parliamentarians to forests and mills in Canada, to a welter of publications
putting the forestry companies' case. Canfor Corporation of Vancouver
recently sent its chief forester to Germany on a speaking tour, and
MacMillan Bloedel is considering a similar initiative.
The CPPA has set up a task force, headed by the chief executives of Scott
Paper and Fletcher Challenge Canada, to suggest further measures. The
options include an environmental 'code of ethics', with compliance signified
by a stamp on Canadian products.
Criticism of the Canadian companies centres on their tree-cutting practices
and on the toxic effluent produced by pulp mills.
