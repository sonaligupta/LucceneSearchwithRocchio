Building designers may have overestimated air-conditioning needs


   By DAVID LAWSON


Air-conditioning became almost a standard feature of building design during
the construction boom of the 1980s. But evidence is emerging that the
designers of this latest generation of buildings seem to have greatly
overestimated the heat produced by the new electronic equipment that litters
modern offices.
Introduced to draw off surplus heat from electronic equipment in the
computer-crammed offices of central London, air-conditioning's popularity
spread widely. But the fans, pumps and refrigeration plant soak up enormous
amounts of energy - perhaps as much as one-fifth of a building's power bill.
And now there are serious doubts that such powerful systems are necessary.
The UK government is attempting to reverse the trend of air-conditioned
offices as part of its campaign to reduce CO2 emissions. Revised building
regulations are due to come into force by 1995, in which, for the first
time, designers and developers will have to justify the need for
air-conditioning.
This has produced protests from some developers who say that occupiers
demand air-conditioning.
However, Stuart Lipton, who led the development of the Broadgate complex in
the City of London, says buildings are over-specified. In other words,
occupiers are paying for air-conditioning they do not need.
The miscalculation in requirements by designers occurred during the building
boom of the 1980s. Peter Hill of the Building Research Establishment's
Energy Conservation Support Unit argues that office equipment consumes far
less energy than anticipated by the developer teams. Tenants are paying a
hefty price for air-conditioning systems that can cope with up to five times
the real amount of heat generated, he says.
'Such a cooling system will always be operating inefficiently, vastly
increasing energy consumption and costs,' he says in a paper presented to
Clima 2000, the international energy and environment convention recently
held in London.
These over-indulgent systems are, according to Hill, a result of fear and
ignorance. Equipment contributes only 10 per cent of overall office heat but
designers build in hefty safety factors, he says. They do this to protect
themselves against potential complaints from occupiers over failure to cool
buildings sufficiently. At other times, Hill warns, they simply do not check
the heat output of individual machines.
Hill's research indicates that simply adding up the potential items likely
to be used in an office and multiplying that by the manufacturers' ratings
does not work. One personal computer tested in Hill's research was rated at
90 watts but consumed only 30W. A laser printer used an average of 75W
compared with a rating of 850W, while a photocopier took 126W rather than
the rated 1250W.
Another important factor in heat production is how often equipment is used.
A room full of executives, for instance, would create less heat than a
typing pool. A survey of 74 UK companies with a combined workforce of 3,500
showed that 10 per cent of managers never touched a PC and 45 per cent were
only intermittent users. Typists, however, were 100 per cent users.
Figures also vary for different professions. Some 40 per cent of draughtsmen
are regular PC users compared with 78 per cent of accountants.
Surveyors, who have a leading role in planning the capacity of services in
any building, might look to their own work patterns for a hint of where they
may be going wrong. Only 23 per cent are regularly in front of their PC and
a quarter never go near one.
Designers cannot simply calculate the number of staff in a building,
multiply that by the likely pieces of equipment and come up with a heat
output. But they can produce a 'usage diversity factor' compiled from the
type of staff and the minimum number per machine - ranging from perhaps one
person per PC to 20 per fax.
Office size and occupation density are also important. A big telesales or
financial services floor will have far more staff and machines crammed into
each square metre of space. On the other hand, a small office with a few
staff will still need a standard range of equipment, so energy use per head
may be relatively high. This means power consumption can vary between 50W
and 250W per person in large offices.
Most speculative developers would maximise the letting potential for a
building by aiming for the top of this range, and some occupiers will end up
paying for an air-conditioning system five times as powerful as they need.
If designers continue to cater for the most energy-hungry potential user,
this burden of over-capacity could get worse for less exacting users.
Research by Brecsu shows that as extra and more powerful equipment is
introduced, power consumption could rise over the rest of the decade to
around 300W per person in larger offices and to 350W in those with around 50
staff.
From 2000, even the energy guzzlers may find themselves paying too much for
heat extraction, as conservation measures will steadily reduce demand to
200W per person. The computer industry is already adjusting to new demands,
as Jacques Roturier, professor at Bordeaux University, pointed out at Clima
2000.
The majority of the 30,000 PCs sold in Sweden each year now have automatic
turn-off monitors providing a stand-by capability of less than 8W. The US
Environmental Protection Agency has signed an agreement with leading
manufacturers for a 'star' rating for computers and printers with automatic
turn-offs and a stand-by mode of less than 30W.
But perhaps most significantly, US President Bill Clinton has ordered the
federal government - perhaps the world's biggest computer purchaser - to buy
only energy-efficient equipment. This could lead manufacturers to adopt
energy-saving controls as a standard feature of all equipment.
In the meantime, Hill and Roturier say substantial energy savings could be
achieved by closer examination of the real effects of office equipment
loads, and by avoiding over-estimation for air-conditioning and cooling
systems.
