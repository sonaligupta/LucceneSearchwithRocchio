FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Allied Radio cuts deficit to Pounds 0.68m


Allied Radio, which operates licences for Radio Mercury and Mercury Extra in
the south-east and Fortune in Greater Manchester, reduced pre-tax losses
from Pounds 1.46m to Pounds 678,000 for the year to September 30.
The outcome, which included a Pounds 203,000 share of the start-up loss on
Mercury, was achieved on turnover down from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 2.82m.
Allied underwent a capital restructuring in May, the effect of which was the
elimination of interest charges paid on the convertible unsecured loan
stock, which have been converted into ordinary shares.
Pro-forma losses per share based on shares in issue after the reconstruction
were 0.5p (1.1p).
With some Pounds 2m of cash, the board plans to invest in new and existing
licences.
