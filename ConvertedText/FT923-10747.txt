FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Auditors to resist ADT writ strongly


   By ANDREW JACK


BINDER HAMLYN, the accountancy firm, yesterday vigorously defended itself
against a writ issued by ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction
company, in connection with the company's Pounds 110m takeover of Britannia
Security Group.
Mr John Norton, Binder's managing partner, who said he had not yet seen the
writ but knew it had been issued, said: 'We will be resisting it very
strongly.'
The writ accuses Binders of negligent misrepresentation in its role as
auditors to Britannia prior to the takeover of the company by ADT in January
1990.
Binders approved the company's accounts, and is also believed to have held a
meeting with ADT as part of the due diligence which took place before the
acquisition was agreed.
When a more detailed statement of claims is issued to back up the writ, it
is likely to press for damages of up to Dollars 278m (Pounds 146m). This
represents the total value of goodwill written off after the acquisition, as
shown in ADT's 1991 annual accounts.
The report showed that a review of Britannia's businesses showed certain
assets, particularly subscriber systems installed at customer premises had
been included in the accounts 'at values materially in excess of their net
realisable value'.
Mr David Hammond, ADT's deputy chairman, said the company is continuing to
take professional advice on all aspects of the acquis-ition.
He did not rule out legal action against others who were involved, but said
it would not cover the company's own advisers at the time of the takeover.
