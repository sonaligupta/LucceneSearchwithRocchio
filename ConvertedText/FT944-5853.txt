General Magic, the US multimedia communications software company, has added
five new partners to its technology alliance.
Cable and Wireless of the UK, Northern Telecom of Canada and Mitsubishi, Oki
and Sanyo of Japan have each taken a small minority stake in General Magic,
bringing the total shareholding of alliance partners to about 50 per cent.
The new partners will license General Magic's software, called Telescript,
which enables users of personal computers and personal digital assistants to
send 'intelligent agents' into a communications network to deliver messages,
retrieve information or shop.
General Magic said that the new partnerships were further step toward
establishing its technology as a worldwide standard for multimedia
communications.
General Magic's existing partners include AT&T, which recently launched its
PersonaLink network using General Magic software, as well as Apple Computer,
France Telecom, Fujitsu, Motorola, NTT, Philips and Toshiba.
The new General Magic partners plan to develop products and services based
on Telescript and General Magic's Magicap user interface software.
Cable & Wireless said it would develop multimedia services for users of its
global digital network.
