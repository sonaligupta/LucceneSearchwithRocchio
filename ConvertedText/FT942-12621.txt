FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Samsung defies car plant report


   By JOHN BURTON


Samsung, one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, is to press ahead with
the production of passenger cars in spite of possible government opposition.
It said it would start building a factory for passenger cars in July at a
yet undetermined site and begin producing vehicles at the end of 1997,
making it the country's fifth car company.
The statement followed a report on Tuesday by a state research institute
warning that Samsung's entry into the car industry could lead to excess
production capacity.
Samsung Heavy Industries is holding negotiations with Nissan and Toyota on
the supply of vehicle technology.
Korea's big three carmakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - have also expressed
opposition to Samsung's entry, claiming it would severely disrupt the Korean
motor industry.
The government may try to block Samsung's proposed car project by turning
down its application for the import of foreign technology. Samsung is
expected to file an application with the ministry of trade and industry next
month.
The ministry has the right to refuse a foreign technology import request if
it threatens the national economy.
The report by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade
(KIIET), which is associated with the ministry, could be used to block
Samsung. It was commissioned by the Korea Automobile Manufacturers'
Association, and warned that Samsung's import of Japanese technology would
damage efforts to achieve technical self-sufficiency in the motor industry.
It would also lead to increased imports of Japanese car components, harming
the trade balance.
