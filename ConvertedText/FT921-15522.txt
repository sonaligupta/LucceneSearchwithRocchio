FT  09 JAN 92 / British Gas may face inquiry


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH GAS could face an investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission unless it removes the conditions it has attached to its agreement
last month to halve its share of the industrial gas market by 1995.
The company has until tomorrow to make its position clear to the Office of
Fair Trading (OFT).
British Gas late last month said it had agreed to certain proposals by the
OFT which included hiving off its pipeline division into a separate company
as well as cutting its industrial gas market share from 90 per cent to 40
per cent.
But at the same time, Mr Bob Evans, British Gas chairman, stressed that the
company's agreement depended on being able to raise domestic prices. This
would require adjustments to a tough new pricing formula which is due to
take effect in April.
British Gas yesterday said the issues were part of the same package and that
it had spelt out its views to the OFT during six weeks of talks before
Christmas.
Sir James McKinnon, director general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, said
there was no link between the company's agreements on the industrial market
and its domestic pricing commitments.
'I will review the formula, but I am not prepared to allow
cross-subsidisation of one sector of the business by another sector,' he
said.
If British Gas insists on linking the two issues, the OFT will have no
choice but to refer the company to the MMC. British Gas said it was prepared
to face an MMC investigation.
MMC officials have indicated privately that they are preparing for a swift
review of the gas industry.
