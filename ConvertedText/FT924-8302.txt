FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Amersham rises 24% to Pounds 10m as
healthcare sales improve


   By JANE FULLER


TURNROUNDS IN its healthcare division and in interest payments helped
Amersham International, which makes radioactive products, to increase
pre-tax profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.2m in the six months to September
30.
The advance from Pounds 8.2m was achieved on reduced turnover of Pounds
124.8m (Pounds 136.6m) as the clinical reagents business, sold to Eastman
Kodak, dropped out.
Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said like-for-like sales grew by 10
per cent at constant exchange rates. Operating profit from ongoing
businesses rose 18 per cent, from Pounds 6.8m to Pounds 8m.
Royalties from clinical reagents amounted to Pounds 1.7m, compared with last
year's Pounds 2.8m. Annual royalty income was expected to be Pounds
4m-Pounds 5m.
Operating profit was struck after research and development spending of
Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 7.3m). The pre-tax figure benefited from Pounds 400,000
of interest received compared with a Pounds 1.4m charge. This followed the
receipt of Pounds 47m from Kodak at the end of March.
In the healthcare division the turnround amounted to Pounds 1.8m to give an
operating profit of Pounds 200,000 on sales of Pounds 42.3m (Pounds 40.1m).
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said sales of Ceretec, the brain imaging
agent, grew by 36 per cent to Pounds 9m and there had been a small
improvement in gross margins of the commodity products.
Margins could be rebuilt by increasing the branded element of the portfolio.
Progress had been made with both the follow-ups to Ceretec: Metastron, for
cancer pain relief, and Myoview, a heart imager.
In the life science division, which serves academic institutions and
research wings of pharmaceuticals companies, an additional Pounds 700,000 in
research and development spending accounted for the fall in operating profit
to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 10.5) on sales of Pounds 46.9m (Pounds 44.9m).
Mr Castell said cuts in Japan, Germany and France had been offset by growth
in the UK and the US.
Long-term prospects lay in such areas as DNA investigation to diagnose
genetic propensity to illness.
Industrial quality and safety assurance improved profit by 10 per cent to
Pounds 2.3m. Losses in environmental assays were little changed at Pounds
1.3m.
Earnings per share rose to 11.4p (9.1p). The interim dividend goes up to 4p
(3.7p).
COMMENT
With 85 per cent of sales overseas but most of its manufacturing in the UK,
Amersham stands to benefit by at least Pounds 5m from sterling's
devaluation. Factoring that into next year's profit forecasts alongside the
underlying business growth helped pushed the share price up 29p to 555p
yesterday. Amersham's tantalising prospects come in two packages: ample
scope for rebuilding margins in healthcare and a promising product pipeline.
Profits should also be helped by reduced losses in environmental assays now
that the new dipstick to test for contamination is on the market. For the
full year, profit is forecast to grow from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 24m-Pounds
25m. The prospective p/e of about 20 makes the group look fully valued short
term, but forecasts of a 30 to 40 per cent profit increase next year make
the stock worth holding.
