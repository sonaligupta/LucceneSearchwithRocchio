FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Bain Clarkson in Vietnam


Bain Clarkson, the international insurance broker which is part of Inchcape,
yesterday announced a new joint venture in Vietnam, becoming the first
insurance broker to be licensed in the country.
The deal follows hard on the heels of the announcement earlier this month of
the liberalisation of the local market, hitherto dominated by Baoviet, the
state-owned insurance company.
Bain Clarkson, which already operates in 11 other countries in east Asia, is
setting up a 50:50 joint venture between its Inchcape Insurance Holdings
(Hong Kong) subsidiary and Baoviet. Each partner will invest Dollars 125,000
(Pounds 83,000) in the new company, Inchinbrok, which will operate initially
from Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
