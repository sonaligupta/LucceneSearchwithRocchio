   BAHRAIN


Islamic finance ministers will meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday to
approve a plan to double the paid-up capital of the Islamic Development Bank
(IDB) to around Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.2bn), Reuter reports from Bahrain.
Iraq, an IDB member, has been invited, according to one official, but it was
not clear whether it would send a representative to Saudi Arabia, which
fought Iraq in the Gulf crisis.
