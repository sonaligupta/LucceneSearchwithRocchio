FT  23 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Failed bid throws spotlight on dual roles
of Enterprise chief


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Mr Graham Hearne is expected by the end of the year to surrender his role as
chief executive of Enterprise Oil, the independent oil company which earlier
this month failed to take over rival explorer Lasmo with a controversial
Pounds 1.6bn bid.
Institutions are thought to be keen to take the opportunity presented by the
failed bid to press Mr Hearne for an early division of his roles as chairman
and chief executive.
Mr Hearne, who is to retire in three years at 60 - the company's normal
retirement age - had previously indicated he would relinquish one of the
posts at some stage.
'If he had not tripped up he would have got away with it,' said one
investor. 'Having tripped up, it is another story.'
Institutions are also thought to be strongly advocating that an outsider
should fill the chief executive's post. This would appear to rule out Mr
Michael Pink, the former Shell executive who was appointed as Enterprise's
chief operating officer in May.
'It has to be an outsider to be meaningful,' said one institution. 'Everyone
inside the company owes too much to too many people to be really
independent.'
There was some speculation in the industry and the City that Mr Sam Laidlaw,
managing director of Amerada Hess, the US oil group, or Mr Lance Johnson of
Mobil Oil could be possible candidates.
Mr Laidlaw yesterday refused to comment. He said, however, that speculation
of an approach from Enterprise was 'without foundation'.
Mr Andrew Shilston, Enterprise's finance director, said the company had not
had discussions with anyone regarding the chief executive's post.
