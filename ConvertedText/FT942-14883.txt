FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): GAN - Other Companies


Analysts have long been braced for a weak set of results on Tuesday when
GAN, one of France's largest insurers, unveils its 1993 figures. GAN has
been hit by the competitive state of the French insurance sector and by the
exposure of its banking subsidiaries to the property market. Mr Tim Dawson,
insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers, anticipates a recovery in net profits
to around FFr750m (Dollars 129m) for 1993 from 1992's dire total of FFr402m.
