FT  30 NOV 94 / Lottery draws 20m BBC viewers


Twenty million people tuned in to see the BBC's first lottery programme,
more than twice as many as were watching ITV, according to viewing figures
published yesterday by Barb, the audience research group.
The figures showed ITV's Blind Date with about 9m viewers, a fall of 4m from
the previous week.
After the lottery draw, most viewers stayed with BBC1 to watch hospital
series Casualty - which had 17m viewers, up from fewer than 14m the previous
week and almost double the 8.8m who watched Diana: Portrait Of A Princess,
on ITV.
