FT  19 APR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rallies after early setback
 -Market report


   By REUTER


COFFEE futures opened sharply lower at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday morning reflecting hefty losses in New York on Friday following
news Brazil was to release coffee stocks internally. But prices bounced in a
move some traders linked to the Brazilian growers' association voicing its
disapproval of the plan and threatening legal action.
The near July position closed Dollars 9 down at Dollars 1,437 a tonne after
touching a low of Dollars 1,428.
The COCOA was roused from its torpor by a lively New York market. Traders
said there was nothing fundamental behind the interest but some cited the
bullish implications of a trader's report showing a large net long
speculative position. The July position ended at Dollars 917 a tonne, up
Dollars 16, after backing off resistance at Dollars 920.
At the London Metal Exchange COPPER'S early rally, encouraged by commission
house buying, had dwindled by the close as overhead selling and resistance
took the three months price from a high of Dollars 1,894 a tonne to Dollars
1,885, a net loss of Dollars 2 and still within the recent Dollars
1,880-Dollars 1,900 range.
Attempts by ALUMINIUM to break above Dollars 1,300 resistance (for three
months delivery) failed repeatedly during the day as the market ran into
profit-taking and speculative selling. The price ended at Dollars 1,298 a
tonne, down Dollars 7.50.
LEAD traded routinely but continued to find support on dips towards Dollars
450 a tonne, where underlying trade interest was again emerging.
News that the US Federal Reserve wanted to raise short-term interest rates
had little impact on LME trading, dealers said.
But the news caused some slippage in precious metal prices, which had
previously firmed slightly in the afternoon, spurred by fund buying on the
New York SILVER futures market, which encouraged participation in gold.
In London cash silver closed 3 cents up at Dollars 5.28 1/2 a troy ounce,
while GOLD put on 45 cents at Dollars 377.70 an ounce.
