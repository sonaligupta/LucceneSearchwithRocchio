FT  13 NOV 93 / Greek riot police disperse scores of masked youths


   By REUTER


   ATHENS


GREEK riot police yesterday fired teargas to disperse scores of masked
youths who hurled stones and set a fire-engine alight after an anti-Nazi
march in Athens, Reuter reports from Athens.
Police said that about 100 youths had run amok after the peaceful march by
some 2,000 students who were protesting against a recent attack on a teenage
girl by a neo-Nazi group.
Riot police fired teargas near and into Athens University business school,
where the rioters had fled after they set the fire-engine alight.
Earlier students had marched through Athens, chanting 'Down with Fascism'
and 'Never, never, never' as they waved banners aloft, sang and danced their
way along central Stadiou street.
The march was called after the public order ministry ordered an
investigation on Thursday into a neo-Nazi group that allegedly had etched a
swastika on the face of a teenage student.
