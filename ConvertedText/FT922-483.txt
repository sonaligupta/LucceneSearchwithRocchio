FT  27 JUN 92 / Recession could cut the cost of dying


   By TIM BURT


DYING could become cheaper, according to the director of Britain's first
management course for undertakers.
The recession looks set to spark intense competition among funeral
companies. Cut-price burials and service discounts could soon be offered.
And it is not just economic hard times that have hit the funeral business.
The trend among customers towards greater life expectancy has not helped.
Although steady demand has kept most funeral companies in profit during the
recession, some are now looking at value-for-money options to increase
market share.
Mr Stuart West - who runs the course at the International Co-operative
College at Loughborough, Leicestershire, where more than 30 undertakers
graduated yesterday - says companies can only expand by taking market share
from competitors.
'To get market share you have to get price benefits to the customers,' he
said. 'So funerals are likely to get cheaper.'
Companies may also be forced to drop voluntary restrictions on advertising
and diversify into financial services for the bereaved as they compete for
business.
Large companies, such as Great Southern and the French-owned Plantsbrook
group, already offer pre-paid funerals, and others are understood to be
considering investment portfolio schemes and estate management.
Price cuts would be welcomed by consumer groups which this year complained
that funeral costs had increased by more than 50 per cent since 1985.
The average cost of a basic funeral is about Pounds 600, although extras
such as an oak coffin can push the price above Pounds 1,000.
