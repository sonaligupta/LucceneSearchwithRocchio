FT  05 MAR 94 / International Company News: Banks to step up pressure on
Walt Disney

The Euro Disney banks plan next week to step up pressure on Walt Disney, the
US entertainment company, to reduce its entitlement to royalty payments and
other fees from the troubled leisure group.
Representatives of 63 international banks in the Euro Disney loan syndicates
yesterday met in Paris to be briefed on the progress of negotiations over
its FFr13bn (Dollars 2bn) emergency financial restructuring between their
steering committee and the Disney companies.
The meeting, which lasted all day, was a continuation of a previous session
on Wednesday.
The steering committee, led by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque
Indosuez, has for the past fortnight been holding informal negotiating
meetings with Euro Disney and Walt Disney.
One of its main objectives is to ensure that the US group plays a larger
part in the final restructuring package thereby sharing the burden of
rescuing Euro Disney.
Walt Disney has set a deadline for the completion of the rescue. However, it
is understood to be willing to continue its financial support for Euro
Disney after that date, providing the banks have agreed to an outline deal.
The banks yesterday were given a full presentation of the investigative
audit into Euro Disney that they commissioned from KPMG Peat Marwick, the
consultancy group.
KPMG endorsed recent changes in the management of the EuroDisneyland theme
park.
The banks, which had originally considered recommending radical changes in
Euro Disney's strategy and senior personnel, issued a statement saying that
the lossmaking group was 'moving in the right direction'.
