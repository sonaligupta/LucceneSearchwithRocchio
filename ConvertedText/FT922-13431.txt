FT  11 APR 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: My father's estate


MY FATHER had two children by his first wife: my sister and me. After a
divorce, he had an illegitimate son, Michael. My father recognised Michael
as his son, but made no contribution to his upbringing. He then married
again and had another son, John.
My sister died in 1978, leaving three adult children. My father died in
1982. He left the whole of his estate, approximately valued at Pounds
130,000, to his wife. He wife died in 1986, leaving everything to her son
John. Neither my sister, myself nor Michael were in any sense dependent on
our father for financial support.
Do my sister's children, myself and Michael have any claim on our father's
estate?
Any opportunity you might have had to seek an order of the court for
maintenance out of your father's estate has long since lapsed. Claims under
the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975 have to be
made within six months of probate. It seems likely that any such claim would
have failed in any event.
