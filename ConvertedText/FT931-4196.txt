FT  12 MAR 93 / Building society chief suspended


   By TIM COONE


   DUBLIN


Dr Edmund Farrell, chairman of the Irish Permanent Building Society, which
is due to be floated on the Irish stock exchange this year, has been
suspended by the company's board while transactions relating to his Dublin
home are investigated, Tim Coone writes from Dublin.
The IPBS is Ireland's largest building society, with mortgage lending
estimated to be in excess of IPounds 2bn (Pounds 2bn). It is doubtful that
the flotation can go ahead until this inquiry is completed.
