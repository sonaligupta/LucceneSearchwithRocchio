FT  06 NOV 93 / International Company News: German retailers may combine


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


   BERLIN


KARSTADT and Hertie, two of Germany's biggest retail groups, are holding
merger talks in a bid to consolidate their position and pool purchasing
power.
A merger of the two, respectively Germany's largest and third largest
department store groups, would create a company with a combined turnover of
DM28bn (Dollars 16bn), and a retail network of 238 outlets.
Karstadt has 164 outlets and recorded a total turnover of DM20.5bn last
year.
Total sales at Hertie, which owns KaDeWe, the famous department store in
Berlin, were DM5.9bn.
The German Cartel Office confirmed yesterday that the two companies were
holding merger discussions. Company officials were reluctant to give
details.
The talks between the two companies reflects the increasing competition and
pressure from discount stores which have mushroomed over recent years
throughout Germany.
The discussions also continue a trend which has seen several department
stores merge such as Neckermann, or quit the business like Quelle.
The talks, which could lead to Kartstadt buying part of the Hertie chain,
follows earlier discussions aimed at a leasing agreement rather than an
outright purchase of Hertie by Karstadt. Mr Sy Schluter, a retail expert at
CSFB in Frankfurt, said the purchase was likely to involve Hertie selling
its shares to Karstadt.
Any merger would allow Hertie to tackle its high personnel costs which
analysts say are about 10 per cent above the department store average. Other
costs, including management and distribution, are estimated to be 15 per
cent above it competitors.
'Hertie needs to invest, particularly in logistics and computers. Its
turnover is too small at the moment,' said Mr Schluter.
