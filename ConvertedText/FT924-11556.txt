FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: A policy matter


I AM 63, waiting to cash in my s226 policies at 65 or later. I have some 12
separate policies, for varying sums, most of which can be taken at any age
up to 75. I need to protect my future income, perhaps for as long as 30
years, against inflation and taxation.
Would it be better to take an inflation-protected annuity at 65 for the full
value of the funds, or a level pension with part of the funds at 65, and
then top it up at intervals to age 75 with the remainder of the funds. Are
there rules for working out which might be better?
This is a matter of personal judgment and temperament. No one can predict
the rate of inflation over the next 30 years nor your longevity. The prudent
approach is to buy as much advance protection as possible against future
inflation by taking the proceeds of your various policies and purchasing an
index linked annuity at the time you retire. You may find it advantageous to
seek independent professional advice to sort out the many variables in this
competitive market (eg five year guarantee, basis of surviving spouse
annuity etc). You should be careful to agree terms of business with your
adviser and be sure of his independence.
The normal commission rate is 1 per cent, but whatever commission you pay
should be disclosed in advance. If you wish the adviser to use a
non-commission-paying insurer then you should give him the alternative of
charging a fee if such an arrangement (net of such fee) is to your
advantage.
