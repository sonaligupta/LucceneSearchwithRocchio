FT  26 MAY 93 / Moscow to pull plug on state enterprises


   By LEYLA BOULTON

THE Russian government plans to force state enterprises to pay their debts
or declare bankruptcy, according to two radical ministers.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said his Committee for the
Management of State Property had been entrusted with the task of 'launching
bankruptcies' following the adoption by parliament of legislation allowing
companies to go bankrupt.
He said, however, that the actual closing down or restructuring of
unprofitable enterprises would be initiated by creditors.
At the same time, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, yesterday blocked
off the traditional escape route for inefficient enterprises when he
announced that the central bank had agreed to stop creating money to cover
the debts between companies.
That promise was contained in a statement of intent to the International
Monetary Fund, signed on Saturday by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chief.
The central bank's printing of money has fuelled inflation and weakened
incentives for enterprises to become more efficient. Mr Fyodorov said
additional measures would soon be approved by the government to tighten
credit discipline and speed up slow bank transfers - which have also
contributed to the debt crisis.
He said not one enterprise would be allowed to apply for subsidies from his
credit commission unless it provided a bank record of its hard currency
holding. He said Russian enterprises had Dollars 9bn sitting in bank
accounts which they should be encouraged to spend rather than applying to
the state for help.
It remains to be seen whether the central bank and the government will keep
their promises, aimed at unlocking Dollars 3bn in new IMF loans this summer.
A similar statement of intent signed last year by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
former prime minister, secured a first Dollars 1bn loan but its contents
were not implemented.
