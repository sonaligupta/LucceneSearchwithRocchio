FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Canada wheat row talks due


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


Top-level efforts will be made in Marrakesh today to head off a tit-for-tat
trade war over Canadian wheat exports to the US market.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture
secretary, and their Canadian counterparts, Mr Roy MacLaren and Mr Ralph
Goodale, will make a final attempt to settle the dispute before a US-imposed
deadline of April 22.
The US has threatened to clamp down on imports of Canadian wheat, prompting
a warning of retaliation by Ottawa. These imports have surged in recent
years, from 330,000 tonnes in the 1989-90 crop year to 1.5m tonnes in
1992-93 and an estimated 2.5m tonnes in 1993-94.
The latest jump arises partly from the need to plug the gap in animal feeds
supply after a sharp drop in US corn (maize) production because of the
Mississippi floods.
Another factor has been high wheat prices in the domestic US market caused
by the diversion of supplies under the US Export Enhancement Programme. This
has made the US an increasingly attractive market for Canadian wheat.
The unfamiliar sight of Canadian trucks unloading grain at US elevators has
enraged wheatgrowers in the northern US states. They have mounted a strong
political campaign in Washington to curb the trade, spearheaded by the
influential Senator Max Baucus from Montana who is chairman of the trade
subcommittee of the Senate finance committee.
This has caused a big headache for the US administration. While it could
invoke so-called Section 22 import quotas, which are covered by a waiver
from fair trade rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
waiver is due to lapse next year when the Uruguay Round trade accords take
effect.
