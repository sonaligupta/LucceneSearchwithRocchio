FT  28 APR 94 / Funding of school repairs is attacked


   By JOHN AUTHERS and KEVIN BROWN


Britain's schools are crumbling because of a Pounds 4bn backlog of repairs,
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said yesterday.
Mrs Taylor claimed that local authorities would be allocated only 23 per
cent of the capital funds required next year for essential repairs.
Launching the party's education campaign, Mrs Taylor focused on
Labour-controlled Birmingham, which is a Conservative target in the May 5
local elections.
She demanded a public apology from Mr John Patten, education secretary, over
criticism of a Birmingham school in a Conservative leaflet.
The leaflet showed a photograph of graffiti-covered walls in the Four
Dwellings School above the slogan 'Surely our children deserve better than
this]'
Mrs Taylor said the school had been given a positive report by Ofsted, the
government's education watchdog.
She also released a letter from the chairman of Four Dwellings governors to
Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, which claimed the leaflet
was 'inaccurate' and 'offensive to governors, parents and pupils'.
Four Dwellings is in the Quinton ward, where Labour won a by-election last
month. Labour strategists say the election has undermined Conservative
claims that they could capture the city.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said the condition of school
buildings was the responsibility of education authorities and school
governors. Support for capital and repair work would be more than Pounds
600m in 1994-95.
