FT  30 JUN 93 / Ruling defuses GM's row in Finland


   By JOHN GRIFFITHS


A GERMAN district court order requiring General Motors to keep producing
Calibra cars in Finland, while a bitter dispute with its former Finnish
partner Saab-Valmet is resolved, has been set aside by the Frankfurt Court
of Appeal.
The court acted after GM and Saab-Valmet, part of the majority state-owned
paper machinery and engineering group, said they had reached a business
compromise. Under it, Saab-Valmet's plant at Uusikaupunki, Finland, will
produce up to 6,000 Calibras between June 1 this year and the end of next
March, during which an arbitration panel will seek a final settlement.
The earlier district court ruling, made in March, ordered GM to allocate 30
per cent of Calibra output to the Valmet plant.
Under the compromise, both sides also agreed that neither would initiate
other injunction measures during arbitration. GM ceased all Calibra
production in Finland in December, moving Finnish assembly to Germany to
improve capacity utilisation at its Russelsheim plant and to avoid the added
cost penalties of production in Finland.
