FT  12 MAR 93 / Technology: Phone gets a look-in


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Smile warmly, adopt a regal pose and lash on the lipstick. This is the
somewhat tongue-in-cheek advice given by BT to purchasers of its latest
piece of consumer wizardry, the videophone.
The Relate 2000 videophone, with a three-inch colour screen, sends pictures
across ordinary telephone lines. Calls are charged at the usual rate.
The disadvantages are that the picture becomes distinctly blurry as the
caller moves around and the voice is delayed, as with some calls sent via
satellite.
These drawbacks are caused because of the compression needed to send all the
information in a colour picture along a telephone line. A television picture
is transmitted at 140m bits of information per second, whereas the
videophone sends just 14,400 bits - one ten thousandth of the television
picture.
A further drawback is that there is no international standard for
videophones that work on the ordinary network, so not all can communicate.
Two competing technologies have emerged, the GEC Marconi one, known as
M-VTS, and one from AT&T in the US. M-VTS has been adopted by the telephone
companies in Singapore and Hong Kong as well as by BT. In Japan the trading
company Mitsui is selling the GEC Marconi phone. And in the US, MCI has also
teamed up with GEC Marconi in competition with AT&T, which launched its
videophone last year.
BT is targeting its videophone squarely at the consumer. It will be sold
through its shops and the Dixons group from April, although first sales will
be at next week's Ideal Home Exhibition in London.
The low price of the new videophone - Pounds 399 for a single unit and
Pounds 749 for two - has caused some consternation. Consumer marketing
specialist Amstrad had planned to launch a videophone, similarly made by GEC
Marconi, but has been forced to delay plans while it rethinks manufacturing
costs.
