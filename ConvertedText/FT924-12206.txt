US and British defence chiefs said yesterday they wanted to reverse recent
legislation that could prevent nuclear weapon tests after 1996.
The UK, which uses test facilities in Nevada, would be bound by the US ban.
A bill signed into law this month imposed an immediate nine-month moratorium
on nuclear testing in the US, followed by a limited programme up to
September 1996.
The US is understood to have allocated three out of the 15 tests permitted
in the limited programme to Britain, which is anxious to test new safety
features in warheads for its Trident nuclear deterrent.
The temporary moratorium followed similar measures by France and Russia.
speaking after a Nato ministerial meeting, but said President George Bush
had felt he had no alternative but to sign it.
A limited number of tests was necessary to ensure the reliability of
weapons.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said it was highly desirable to
continue testing. The US law allows for the ban to be lifted if other
nuclear powers undertake tests after 1996.
The Nato ministers approved new consultation and planning guidelines for the
use or threatened use of the alliance's remaining nuclear weapons.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said the new guidelines reflected
a reduced reliance on nuclear arms for the alliance's security.
Nato's stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe has been cut to
less than 1,000 warheads, a fifth of the level of six years ago. Withdrawal
of warheads from all ground-based short-range weapons and from naval
tactical weapons was completed ahead of schedule this summer. The remaining
arsenal of aircraft bombs is also being cut.
