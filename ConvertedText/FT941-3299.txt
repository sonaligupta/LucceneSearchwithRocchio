FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (32):
Pioneering with the cordless office


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


While most office workers are still 'tied to their desks' by fixed
telephones, a new generation of cordless telephone systems is set to open up
a market worth up to Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, according to Ericsson, a
pioneering company in this sector.
Ericsson began developing business cordless phone systems in the mid-1980s
andclaims to be the first company to launch a DECT-based system, last year.
This Freeset system works as an 'add-on' to a company's existing phone
network. Low-powered radio base-stations are installed throughout the
premises, and controlled from a radio exchange, which connect directly to
the host telephone system. The main groups of users are organisations with a
large number of mobile staff - such as hospitals, factories and exhibition
centres - where instant communication is important.
The second main group of users are companies which are trying to redefine
the nature of office work, applying the 'hot desk' principle. Digital
Equipment Corporation, using the Freeset system, has been successfully
experimenting with a similar concept which it calls 'the natural office' at
its Swedish offices in Stockholm.
'Once people start using a cordless phone at work, it's impossible to take
it away from them,' comments Ericsson's Hans van der Hoek. In five years'
time, he expects one-third of all business phones sold will be cordless.
