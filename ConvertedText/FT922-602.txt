   PARIS


A consortium headed by GEC-Alsthom, the Franco-British engineering company,
has won an outline Ecu725m (Pounds 509m) contract to supply 37 high-speed
trains to link Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Cologne from 1996, writes
William Dawkins in Paris.
The 300-mph trains are based on France's Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV), with
the difference that they will function on different kinds of electric
current and signalling systems. Of the total, three are going to Germany
four to the Netherlands, 11 to Belgium, nine to France, and 10 on option.
