FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Fax of life and bad planning


   From Mr NIGEL PARKHURST


Sir, I have always been a non-believer in the advantages to organisation
provided by the fax machine, and note that this scepticism has seldom been
so well illustrated as in the first three sentences of your article, 'The
changing fax of life' (April 6).
'It is already late in the evening and you have only just finished putting
together the action plan for tomorrow's annual meeting. Branch managers
scattered throughout the country are waiting anxiously for their copies to
be faxed to them.'
'No need to panic.'
Perhaps not 'panic', but there is every cause to be seriously alarmed when
managers are kept late at their offices for no better reason than that their
superiors do not plan their own workload properly.
