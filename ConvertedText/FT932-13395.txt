FT  23 APR 93 / Observer: All right Jacques


Hands up anyone who can name the boss of the European Investment Bank?
Whatever one thinks about Jacques Attali's tenure at the top of the much
smaller European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he has certainly
made sure that people have heard of him and his bank. If only the same could
be said for the EIB.
Indeed, even if Attali's shareholders do eventually force him to walk the
plank, he will have lasted in the job four times as long as Eugene Meyer, a
former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the first president of the World
Bank - the EBRD's granddaddy. Meyer walked out of the door after only six
months because he fell out with Emilio Collado, the headstrong US director.
If the EBRD's shareholders are thinking of changing presidents, there are
plenty of faceless bureaucrats who would dearly love the job, but not many
figures of substance prepared to put up with the bureaucratic infighting.
