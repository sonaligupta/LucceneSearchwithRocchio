FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Ferfin rights issue may leave
banks in control


   By REUTER


   ROME


Creditor banks of Italy's troubled industrial group, Ferruzzi Finanziaria
(Ferfin), could control 68.9 per cent of the food-to-chemicals company if
they fully take up a complex L1,339bn (Dollars 825m) rights issue, Reuter
reports from Rome.
Ferfin said the stake could end up being owned by the some 50 banks that
make up the consortium guaranteeing the complex four-tranche issue. The
banks now own some 48.7 per cent of Ferfin.
Serafino Ferruzzi, the family holding company that sits above Ferfin and
once controlled what was Italy's second-largest private business, will see
its stake fall to 12 per cent from 19.8 per cent. It has waived its rights
to the new shares.
The capital increase, approved by shareholders last November, involves four
separate operations calling for the issue of a total of 580m shares at
prices ranging from L1,000 to L4,000.
Proceeds will be used to cut Ferfin debts by L706.2bn and those of its
Gruppo Alca (Trading) unit by L633bn.
