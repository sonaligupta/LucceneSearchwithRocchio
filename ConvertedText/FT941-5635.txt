FT  05 MAR 94 / MGN plans to control Independent until 1999


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Mirror Group Newspapers, part of a consortium bidding for control of the
Independent, would have the responsibility of running the newspaper as a
business until 1999, under proposals sent to shareholders last night.
This would include drawing up draft budgets and three-year rolling business
plans but not editorial involvement.
MGN, a group of founders led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, El Pas of Spain
and La Repubblica of Italy have offered 355p a share for the company. There
is also a MGN share and cash deal worth 329.75p.
The consortium says it believes it is 'a matter of great urgency' that it
takes control of Newspaper Publishing, the company that owns both the
Independent and The Independent on Sunday.
It says both the commercial and financial condition of the company 'is
deteriorating rapidly', exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over its
future.
The Department of Trade and Industry is still considering whether or not the
bid should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
MGN has undertaken that Independent advertising revenue for the next three
years from this July shall not fall below that of the year to June this
year.
