FT  20 APR 94 / People: Another flotation for Allen?


Leon Allen, a US businessman who led the successful Pounds 230m management
buy-out of Del Monte Foods International in 1990, has been appointed
chairman of the British Printing Company.
Allen, 54, is chairman of Devro International, the sausage-skin-maker which
came to the stock market last year. His arrival at BPC, which used to be
known as BPCC before its 1989 management buy-out from the late Robert
Maxwell's business empire, is another sign that Britain's largest commercial
printer may also be considering a flotation.
BPC, which employs 5,300 staff and has annual sales of over Pounds 300m, has
been without a chairman for more than six months. Brian Garraway, a former
deputy chairman of BAT Industries, died last September only a few months
after taking up the post.
Allen has spent most of his career in the consumer goods industries. He
worked for Procter & Gamble for 18 years, and did three years with The
Clorox Company before joining RJR Nabisco in 1982. He came to the attention
of City investors following the Del Monte MBO. In little more than two years
he reshaped the business, improved the earnings and sold it to South
Africa's Royal Corporation for Pounds 370m in 1992.
Although he is a well regarded manager, his time as a company chairman has
not been without controversy. Shortly before Devro, a Pounds 108m management
buy-out from a US healthcare group, came to the stock market, it was forced
to cancel plans to appoint an outsider as a chief executive following
institutional pressure. As a result Devro had to pay out Pounds 390,000
compensation to the unsuccessful candidate. Allen, who was appointed
non-executive chairman of Devro in February 1993, received a Pounds 200,000
bonus for presiding over the company's flotation in June 1993.
