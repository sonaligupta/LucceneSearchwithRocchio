FT  12 APR 94 / German offshoot confuses picture


   By ANDREW JACK


A receiver to Lancer Boss is flying to Germany to meet the lawyer appointed
to take control of the subsidiary Steinbock Boss to clarify the insolvency
procedures.
In the UK, the receivers are preparing a detailed analysis of the company
and will then report back to creditors.
Although the subsidiary is only part of the group and is wholly owned by it,
German law will apply in a clash with English insolvency procedures.
This will prove particularly difficult in any attempt to sell the entire
group as a single entity, given conflicting interests of accountants,
lawyers and creditors.
The German procedure will make full control of the company from the UK
impossible.
Mr Tony Houghton, an insolvency partner with accountants Touche Ross, said
yesterday: 'Each jurisdiction looks after its own. Any assets in Germany
will be subject to local law. In our experience the German courts are very
suspicious of any sort of interference.'
