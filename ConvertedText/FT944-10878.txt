FT  09 NOV 94 / World Trade News: EU urged to end rum quotas


   By CANUTE JAMES

Rum producers have rejected an EU plan to maintain import quotas on dark
(traditional) rum until the year 2001 while abolishing the quota on light
rum from 1996. The producers, most of whom are in the Caribbean, want all EU
import quotas on rum abolished by January to end shortages of the spirit in
Europe.
Maintaining the dark rum quota was requested by the French government, which
has consistently objected to any increase in rum imports fearing damage to
the rum industry in its overseas territories, mainly Martinique, Guadeloupe
and Reunion. Caribbean producers view this as a setback to their efforts to
increase sales in Europe beyond their current annual quota of 240,000
hectolitres.
The European Commission had earlier proposed a quota of 20,000 hectolitres
per year on rhum agricole which is made from sugar cane juice and produced
mainly in the French overseas territories. 'While being opposed to any
quota, the West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers' Association would have no
objection to such a quota on rhum agricole if it is deemed necessary for the
French departments,' said the Caribbean producers.
Traditional rum, however, is made from sugar cane molasses, not juice, and
is an important part of rum exports to the EU. 'To suggest that a quota
should be maintained on this type of rum is entirely contrary to the spirit
of the overall abolition of the quota system and would seriously damage
existing markets for traditional rum in Europe,' the association said.
The row is the latest between rum producers and the EU over access to the
market. The producers have claimed for the past two years that the EU has
not done enough to prevent a shortage of the spirit in Europe by increasing
the rum import quota and then abolishing it. The shortage is caused by the
EU failing to honour its obligation under the Lome Convention - the trade
and aid treaty between the EU and the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)
countries - to increase the quota in line with rising consumption.
According to the Caribbean producers, the quota for the current year (July
to June) will be exhausted by end of December. By October 7, there remained
152,817 hectolitres to complete the quota, with peak demand expected at
Christmas.
Producers fear that their markets in Europe, which they claim are highly
price-sensitive, will be destroyed by early quota shipments to satisfy
demand, to be followed by a shortage and then by high-priced product after
the imposition of customs duties for shipments not covered by the quota.
'The rum quota has now reached a level of chaos where it is destroying the
markets which the producers have painstakingly built over the years,' the
association said.
Before the Lome Convention, there were no quotas, but rum was subject to
duty. With the first Lome agreement, France insisted on a quota for duty
free imports. As demand rose, rum producers twice requested an increase in
the quota. Neither was granted, mainly because of French pressure.
'The just, equitable and only solution is now to bring the quota abolition
date forward by one year to January 1, 1995. Any measure short of this will
inevitably contribute to the disarray of the Community rum markets,' said
the producers' association.
