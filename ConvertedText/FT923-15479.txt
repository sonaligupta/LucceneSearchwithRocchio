FT  02 JUL 92 / Harrods sale under way


THE traditional queues formed early yesterday morning for the first day of
Harrods' summer sale.
The doors of the store in Knightsbridge, west London, were opened two
minutes early as Grand Prix racing driver Nigel Mansell officially launched
the sale.
The store's chairman, Mr Mohammed Al Fayed, is donating Pounds 50,000 to
charities chosen by Mr Mansell, including a hospital maternity wing.
Among the bargains in the sale were a diamond watch halved in price to
Pounds 40,000, a 25-in television set reduced from Pounds 729 to Pounds 199
and a microwave oven reduced from Pounds 279 to Pounds 99.
Mr Grant Lloyd, of Bracknell, Berkshire, had been queueing for more than two
hours for a Pounds 180 tennis racket on sale at Pounds 29.
'I'm actually hoping to get four. I know a few people who are interested in
them,' he said.
