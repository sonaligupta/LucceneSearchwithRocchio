FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: SA glass group rises 16% at six
months

Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries has reported a rise in after-tax
income to R114.9m (Dollars 32.66m) for the six months to September, a 16 per
cent rise on last year's earnings of R99.2m for the same period.
Turnover at the South African company, owned by SA Breweries, rose 17 per
cent to R1.82bn from R1.58bn, but operating profit rose only 8 per cent to
R185.8m from R172.5m.
Net financing costs dropped to R10.7m from R14.9m reflecting lower
borrowings, which stood at R295.1m compared with R303m a year ago. However,
this was up on the year-end figure of R218.5m, largely as a result of higher
short-term borrowings to meet seasonal capital needs.
The company's best performing division was international arm Belron, which
continued to show good results in Europe and saw particularly rapid growth
in Australia and the US. Central African operations also performed
creditably, and the company is currently expanding its Zimbabwean operations
through a ZDollars 130m rights issue.
However, domestic sales were less robust as Glass South Africa was hurt by
the motor industry strike, which stopped sales to original equipment
manufacturers.
PG Bison, which makes boards and laminates for the furniture industry, also
had a weak first quarter, but since then the group reports that sales have
been excellent.
PGSI has also said that PG Bison will embark on R600m plant expansion to
increase capacity ahead of anticipated demand from the furniture market and
building industry.
