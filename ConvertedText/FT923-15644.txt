FT  01 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Freight futures spiral
downwards


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


LONDON'S FREIGHT futures market enters July, a month of seasonally low
prices, with prices on a seemingly unstoppable downward spiral.
The Baltic Freight Index, the barometer of dry cargo shipping rates on which
the market is based, yesterday fell for the 27th consecutive day, shedding
13 points to 1,091 and taking the total decline over the period to 197
points.
'This market is very consistent in being negative,' said Mr Philippe van den
Abele of Clarkson Wolff. 'The shipping market has been hit by a lack of
Japanese demand for raw materials since the beginning of the year.'
Demand for freight had fallen not only in the grain sector, but also in iron
ore and coal.
Ms Cathy Severn, freight trader with GNI, the London futures broker, said
that last year had seen very buoyant prices following the upsurge of
activity in grain to the former Soviet Union. With the market running high,
older ships had not been scrapped, making this year's downturn worse.
The June contract went off the board yesterday at 1,108, compared with 1,705
in June last year.
