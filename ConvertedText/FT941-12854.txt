FT  28 JAN 94 / Deputy quits in fall-out with Reno


   By JUREK MARTIN


   WASHINGTON


The Clinton administration's acute personnel problems were compounded
yesterday by the abrupt resignation of Mr Philip Heymann, number two at the
justice department.
Mr Heymann, appearing alongside Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, at a
regular weekly press conference, cited differences in 'operating and
management style' with his boss. Both insisted there were no philosophical
or political disagreements but that the personal chemistry, in Mr Heymann's
words, 'was not right'. He said he had told the White House of his intention
to resign on Wednesday night.
The deputy attorney general, a veteran of the justice department in
Democratic administrations over the past 30 years, a former member of the
Watergate prosecution team and a Harvard law professor, had been considered
the experienced but overworked rock in a department headed by an attorney
general with no previous federal record and with many of its senior
positions still unfilled.
His departure is certain to reflect badly not only on the White House but
also on Ms Reno, the former Miami state prosecutor and President Bill
Clinton's third choice as attorney general after two earlier candidates had
fallen foul of Nannygate problems. She took the country by storm with her
blunt acceptance of responsibility for the violent end last spring of the
siege in Waco, Texas, of the Branch Davidian religious cult.
Though still very popular outside Washington for her forthright views on
social issues, she has come under growing capital sniping for alleged
administrative shortcomings and for failing to mobilise her department on a
variety of issues.
