FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: GPA signs rescue deal with GE


   By ROLAND RUDD


GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing company which has been struggling with
debt of Dollars 5.8bn (Pounds 3.76bn), yesterday signed its rescue deal with
GE Electric of the US.
Mr Dennis Stevenson, chairman of his own consultancy groups, the SRU, and
the Tate Gallery, has agreed to become non-executive chairman.
GPA has finalised plans for a Dollars 150m capital raising, the granting of
options to GE Capital, GE's financial services arm, to take control of the
company, and the deferral of Dollars 750m of debt repayments for three years
plus the injection of Dollars 150m of new money.
Although the deal was largely agreed in May, the complexity of the
documentation has delayed finalisation until now. It is designed to give the
company the stability to enable it to reduce debt through aircraft sales
within three years.
GE Capital will have an option to buy up to 67 per cent of the company by
March 1998, paying between Dollars 110m and Dollars 165m. For three years
after that it can buy further shares and could take 100 per cent control of
GPA.
GPA will pass management of its assets to GE Capital Aviation Services,
under a 15-year contract.
Its new chairman will be Mr Tony Ryan, who is steping down from the aircraft
leasing company he founded in 1975. An arbitrator is still looking into his
Dollars 2m claim for compensation for loss of office.
