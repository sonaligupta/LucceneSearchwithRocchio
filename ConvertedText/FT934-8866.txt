FT  13 NOV 93 / EU, S Korea in chemicals agreement


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


THE European Union and South Korea yesterday announced an agreement on
intellectual property rights covering EU pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemicals.
The announcement followed the annual EU-Korean ministerial meeting between
Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Han Sung-joo, the
South Korean foreign minister, in Seoul.
Sir Leon also asked South Korea to open its rice market as part of the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - something
Seoul has persistently refused to do, demanding an exception to the
all-tariffication rule.
