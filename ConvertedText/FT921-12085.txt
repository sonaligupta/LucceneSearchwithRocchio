FT  29 JAN 92 / World Trade News: US court upholds ban on tuna fish
re-exports

A San Francisco federal court has upheld a secondary ban on third countries
re-exporting Mexican and Venezuelan tuna to the US, in another twist to the
row over dolphin-killing by Mexican tuna fishermen, Damian Fraser reports
from Mexico City.
The federal court gave 27 countries until Friday to prove they were not
re-exporting Mexican or Venezuelan tuna, which under the Marine Mammal
Protection Act is banned from the US. Countries not complying with the court
order will be included in the embargo. The main Mexican and Venezuelan
'tuna-launderers', according to San Francisco environmentalists, are Japan,
Italy, Spain, France, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia.
US law, upheld by a federal court last February, mandates an embargo on a
country's tuna exports if the fleet's average dolphin mortality rate is 25
per cent higher than the US's. In August the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade found the US could not use trade curbs to impose environmental
laws on Mexico in this instance, and the embargo violated Gatt rules. In
September Mexico dropped the Gatt case. A solution has yet to be found.
