investment unit

   JOHANNESBURG.


LIBERTY Life, the big South African life insurance group, plans to raise
R1bn (Dollars 300m) by floating 20 per cent of its investment portfolio
subsidiary on the local stock market.
The company to be floated is Liblife Strategic Investments (Libsil). The
market value of its investment portfolio, which includes stakes in some of
South Africa's leading blue chip companies, is around R5.6bn.
Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said half of the flotation proceeds would be
used to redeem preference shares in Libsil with the balance used to develop
Liberty Life's mainstream insurance business.
The Libsil portfolio includes a 23.8 per cent holding in Stanbic, South
Africa's leading banking group; 9.4 per cent of South African Breweries; and
23.4 per cent of the Premier Group, the food company.
It also has a 4.6 per cent in Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house
with some of the richest gold mines.
The listing, one of the largest in South Africa, will be of R560m ordinary
shares in Libsil. The shares have a net asset value of about R10 each.
