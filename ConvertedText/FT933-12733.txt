explore potential for co-operation

   NEW YORK


THE NEW York Mercantile Exchange and the Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros in
Sao Paulo, Brazil, have agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding to
explore areas of potential co-operation, the exchanges said yesterday,
reports Reuter from New York.
The exchanges said they would discuss sharing information on technical,
market, regulatory and business issues, and explore the potential for joint
projects that would mutually benefit the exchanges and their memberships.
'It's very, very preliminary and we haven't even looked at the potential
areas yet,' a Nymex official said.
Mr Patrick Thompson, the exchange's president said: 'As two of the world's
leading commodity exchanges, sharing ideas and information will not only be
advantageous to our institutions and memberships, but also to the world
commodity industry'.
Nymex is the world's largest oil market, offering trading in crude, heating
oil, gasoline, natural gas and propane, as well as platinum futures and
options and palladium futures.
The statement said BM & F, according to Futures Industry Association
figures, was the world's sixth largest commodity and futures exchange, with
daily volume of about Dollars 2bn.
It trades gold, interest rates, coffee, stock index futures, US dollars,
soyabeans, cotton and live cattle.
BM & F said the memorandum would be an important step towards
'globalisation' of the two markets.
