FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Corning growth slows to 6% in
second period

CORNING Inc, the US high-technology group, yesterday reported a 6 per cent
increase in second-quarter earnings per share, excluding special charges,
and blamed the slow growth mainly on poor retail conditions and economic
deterioration in Europe.
The company announced net income of Dollars 89.8m, or 47 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 67.2m, or 35 cents, in the same period of last year.
However, the 1992 figures were held back by a one-time reduction in equity
earnings of Dollars 16.3m, or 9 cents a share. Net sales rose from Dollars
871.5m to Dollars 906.8m.
Mr James Houghton, chairman, said the company expected a continued
improvement in earnings in the second half.
However, the second-quarter results were below the company's expectations,
and the trend was similar to that in the first quarter - 'a good start in
the first eight weeks and a disappointing slow-down in the last four weeks'.
He said the US optical fibre and cable businesses were strong and the
laboratory testing business had a good quarter.
Weakness was concentrated in consumer products, which were hurt by poor
retail environments, and all of the European businesses.
Damon Corporation, a medical testing laboratory group which which was the
subject of a Dollars 370m unsolicited bid from Corning on Monday, said
yesterday its board had directed management to hold negotiations with
Corning.
Corning's move followed a Dollars 258m agreed bid for Damon last week from
National Health Laboratories.
