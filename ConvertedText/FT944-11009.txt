FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Viag to focus on core business

Viag, the German conglomerate with interests ranging from energy to drink
cans, is to shift to a period of consolidation under a new chairman,
according to Mr Jochen Holzer, supervisory board chief.
Mr Alfred Pfeiffer is to step down next August, two years before the end of
his contract, and hand control to Mr Georg Obermaier, finance director, the
company said yesterday.
Embellishing the announcement with bullish forecasts of a marked increase in
profits this year and a continuation of the trend in 1995, Mr Pfeiffer said
his previous forecasts of a 35 per cent rise in operating earnings this year
would be exceeded by a wide margin.
According to Mr Holzer, the boardroom change was based exclusively on Mr
Pfeiffer's personal decision to step down. He would join the supervisory
board and continue to be represented on other important group bodies.
A replacement finance director has yet to be found.
Main elements in the group's new policy would be strong internal growth and
a focus on core businesses, such as energy, chemicals, packaging and
logistics. Supplementary businesses - including telecommunications, which
might be built up to a mainstream operation - would be open for possible
partnerships, Mr Holzer said.
Disposals to tidy the group's portfolio could not be ruled out, although
there were no concrete plans, he added.
The consolidation follows a long period of acquisitions which ended in March
this year in a complex deal under which Viag took over Bayernwerk, the
Bavarian state energy utility, and moved its headquarters from Dusseldorf to
Munich.
