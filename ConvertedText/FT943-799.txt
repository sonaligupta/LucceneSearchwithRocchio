FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (7): Tax breaks aid the Freeport


   By LESLIE CRAWFORD


Mauritius Freeport, the island's international trade depot, is to raise its
capacity after a first year of operation in which demand for warehouse space
far exceeded supply. The government has signed a contract with the French
construction company Bollore to increase the 7,500 square metres of
warehouse space at the Port Louis site by 100,000 square metres.
In its first year the depot, which offers substantial tax breaks for firms
trading there, registered 180 companies and a turnover of MRs200m mainly in
the re-export of chemicals, fertilisers, plastic goods and textiles to
Africa. Activities are now diversifying.
Rajakrishna Chellapermal, marketing manager for the Mauritius Freeport
Authority, says French companies plan to assemble vehicle spare parts and
environmental equipment. Australian companies are importing computer
components from the Far East for re - export to Australia.
The Freeport is linked to the emerging offshore banking sector. Its
activities do not come under customs control. Raw materials, equipment and
other inputs are exempt from duty. Companies pay no corporate tax,
withholding tax on dividends or stamp duties on transaction documents.
Through Mauritius' membership of the African Preferential Trade Area,
exports to 18 countries enjoy lower tariffs if 45 per cent of the value
added originates in Mauritius. 'Goods don't physically need to come here,'
Mr Chellapermal says. 'They can be merely invoiced in Mauritius to take
advantage of the fiscal breaks.'
Shortage of warehousing means less than a quarter of companies are fully
operational in the Freeport, which urgently needs to develop specialised
facilities such as cold rooms.
