FT  07 JAN 94 / Inflation down in Greece


   By REUTER


   ATHENS


Greece's annual consumer price inflation rate fell to 12.1 per cent in 1993
and should be in line with the European Union average by 1997, Reuter
reports from Athens.
The inflation rate met government targets for 1993, and was down from 14.4
per cent in 1992.
Greece hopes to bring inflation to below 10 per cent by the end of this
year. This would be the first single-digit figure in 20 years.
The 1993 rate of 12.1 per cent is about three times the present EU average.
Mr Yannis Boutos, central bank governor, said yesterday Greece's biggest
problems were bringing deficits under control and fighting tax evasion.
