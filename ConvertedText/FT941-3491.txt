FT  16 MAR 94 / TV deal proposed on Wimbledon


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Cable television companies yesterday proposed co-operating with the BBC over
rights to the Wimbledon lawn tennis championships.
The BBC's four-year agreement with the All England Club will end with this
summer's championships. British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture
backed by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has said it will bid
against the BBC.
The cable industry wants to broaden and develop its programming and is
interested in acquiring more exclusive rights to sports events. A consortium
of cable companies recently paid Pounds 7m for exclusive rights to the 1996
World Cricket Cup.
At Wimbledon, cable companies want to televise play on the outer courts
which is rarely covered by the BBC. Cable could thus help the BBC with the
cost of acquiring the rights to televise Wimbledon without detracting from
its own coverage.
'I think it would be a logical development,' Mr Richard Woollam,
director-general of the Cable Television Association, said yesterday. He
agreed, however, that the BBC had rebuffed previous approaches on the issue.
Mr Woollam emphasised that the cable companies had no intention of buying
exclusive sports rights and then handing over short news items about the
events to the conventional broadcasters. He said that the cable industry
wanted to split rights with the terrestrial broadcasters in a way that
increased choice for the audience.
Cable executives believe that buying up sports rights and then depriving the
majority of the audience of coverage could create a political backlash.
The cable industry has so far spent Pounds 1.5bn on developing its networks
and plans to spend an additional Pounds 1.2bn this year.
