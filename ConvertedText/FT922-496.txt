FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Michelin poised for 'big profit'
says chairman

MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, is on course for a 'big
profit' this year after a period of heavy losses and should resume dividend
payments, according to Mr Francois Michelin, chairman.
Mr Michelin also told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that, although the
group would eventually like to recapitalise, there was 'no urgency' for it
to do so. The Michelin share price has for some time been depressed by
investors' concern about an equity issue.
Michelin has undergone radical rationalisation, which involved 8,500 job
losses last year alone, in an attempt to adapt to the competitive state of
the global tyre market. The benefits of this restructuring enabled it to
reduce net losses from FFr4.81bn in 1990 to FFr699m (Dollars 134m) in 1991.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, forecast further
recovery this year. 'We are confident that the recovery which began in 1991
will continue in a progressive, steady manner,' he said.
He said that Michelin's sales had risen by 3 per cent in the first five
months of this year, against the same period in 1992. Debt fell from
FFr28.5bn to FFr27.8bn last year.
