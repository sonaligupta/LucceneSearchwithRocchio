FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Bostrom to Pounds
2.03m


   By TIM BURT


Profits at Bostrom more than doubled last year as the vehicle components and
specialist engineering group enjoyed contributions from recent acquisitions
and first-time gains by its seating joint venture.
The Northampton-based company saw pre-tax profits jump from Pounds 919,000
to Pounds 2.03m following a 46 per cent increase in turnover from Pounds
34.3m to Pounds 50m, including Pounds 7.94m from acquisitions, in the year
to December 31.
The improvement was underpinned by full year contributions from three
recently-acquired subsidiaries - domin-ated by AJW Holdings - which lifted
operating profits in the pressings division to Pounds 721,000 (Pounds
196,000).
Their contribution offset a flat performance in the vehicle seating division
and continued, though reduced, losses in specialist engineering.
Mr Colin Howell, managing director, said the unchanged Pounds 1.89m profit
in the seating business would have increased had it not been for Pounds
200,000 of legal costs in the US, where it ceased distributor operations,
and increased research and development spending.
Losses in the engineering division were reduced from Pounds 525,000 to
Pounds 182,000 as it benefited from restructuring and reorganisation in
1992.
Predicting a better performance this year from all three divisions, Mr
Howell cited the turnround at Bertrand Faure Automotive, the car seat joint
venture, where rising demand from Jaguar transformed a Pounds 99,000 loss
into a Pounds 296,000 profit, as evidence of the group's healthy prospects.
The earnings rise - from 9p to 11.4p - was held back by a Pounds 245,000 tax
charge (Pounds 334,000 credit), although the 1993 rate was just 12 per cent
helped by using tax losses.
The proposed final dividend is held at 2.5p for an unchanged total of 6p.
