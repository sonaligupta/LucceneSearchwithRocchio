FT  17 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Percs re-emerges as Wall
Street buzzword - Patrick Harverson looks at the return of an attractively
simple stock derivative


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


WHEN US investment bankers gather to discuss perks, the talk is usually of
company cars, golf club memberships and 'meetings' in Aspen.
This past year, however, whenever Wall Street's finest have gathered, the
talk is more likely to have been about 'Percs' than about perks.
Preferred equity redemption cumulative stock (Percs) is currently one of the
brightest stars in the corporate finance firmament. Between June and
November last year, a handful of big-name US issuers - including General
Motors, RJR Nabisco and K mart - raised more than Dollars 5bn through Percs.
Percs first surfaced in 1989 as a one-off issue for Avon Products designed
by Morgan Stanley. They then languished for three years, partly because
Avon's decision to cut its dividend alongside the issue, and the subsequent
failure of a vaguely similar product - Shearson Lehman's unbundled stock
units (USUs) - left a bad taste in investors' mouths about Percs.
However, when a cash-hungry GM reopened the file on Percs in the middle of
1991, Morgan Stanley was ready. Once the car-maker's issue was successfully
launched, other companies quickly jumped on the Percs bandwagon.
Unlike many fancy derivative-based products, the design of Percs is quite
simple. They are sold at the market price of the common stock, and are
mandatorily convertible at the end of three years. To attract investors, the
issuer offers a higher dividend than is available on the common, but in
return places a cap - usually 30 per cent - on the appreciation potential of
the Percs.
In effect, when investors purchase Percs they are really buying the common
stock from the issuer, and simultaneously selling the issuer a call option
on the stock - which is a right to buy it back at a predetermined price.
In the past this was known as a 'buy-write', and it involved two distinct
elements, the stock issue and the call option. The great strength of Percs
is that they combine the two in one, creating a simpler, more liquid product
with which investors feel more comfortable.
To the issuer, Percs are attractive in several ways. The company can raise
large amounts of money through an equity product without adding new debt to
its balance sheet. The ratings agencies treat them like common stock, and
they are a highly liquid financial asset.
Issuers also stand to benefit if their share price rises above the cap. Once
the cap has been passed, when conversion time comes around investors do not
receive one common share for each Percs share, but instead get less than
one, with the conversion ratio calculated so that the market value of the
common issued equals the cap. So for every cent or dollar the stock rises
above the cap, the Percs issue becomes more cost-effective and less dilutive
for the issuer.
Perhaps the biggest attraction of Percs is that they enable issuers to tap a
wider audience of potential investors, particularly those which would
normally steer clear of issues of common stock because of the poor yields on
offer.
For investors, the lure of Percs is also clear. In a low-interest rate
environment they offer higher yields than conventional forms of stock such
as common or convertible preferred, and they offer poten-tial for capital
gains on top.
General Motors, for example, issued Dollars 641m of Percs carrying a
dividend yield of 8 per cent - the common yielded only 3.9 per cent at the
time - and a cap of 30 per cent. Even with a ceiling on capital growth, if
the GM share price appreciates over the three-year life of the issue,
investors could enjoy an annual percentage return in the high teens.
The downside for the investor comes if the underlying common stock performs
badly over the three years. Then, the loss taken on conversion is
inadequately compensated by the higher dividend yield offered at the issue
launch.
Percs, therefore, should only be for sophisticated investors who understand
the relationship between the high yield and the equity risk. So far,
although there has been some overseas institutions among Percs buyers, most
have been from the US, primarily income funds and other institutions in
search of high-yielding, relatively low-risk equities.
