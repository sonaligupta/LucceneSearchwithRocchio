FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Gummer policies will not improve
urban life


   From Mr PAUL ORCHARD-LISLE


Sir, John Gummer, the secretary of state for the environment, has made much
of his intention to promote the town centre as the right place for new
shopping developments. As a concept his thinking deserves support, but
delivery is a separate matter.
He would have little to complain about if his ideas were to be defeated by
the shopping public or by retailers. But it is his own department and his
neighbours at the Department of Transport whose policies are the most likely
to destroy his vision.
Mr Gummer's difficulties lie in access to markets. High-street retailers and
shopping centres must compete for consumers' spending power - the most
accessible and pleasant will be the winner.
That is the crux of the problem. The Department of Transport has no money
for big road initiatives in town centres, and the Department of the
Environment says that money collected for the uniform business rate will not
be returned to the local authorities to enable them to improve shopping
environments, facilities such as car parking, or public transport networks.
On this basis Mr Gummer's policies should be seen for what they are -
protection of the countryside and not the advancement of urban life.
