FT  25 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Venezuelan utility ahead 11%


   By JOSEPH MANN


   CARACAS


LA ELECTRICIDAD de Caracas, Venezuela's largest publicly-held utility,
reported net earnings of USDollars 97.4m for 1991, up 11 per cent from the
1990 figure.
La Electricidad, founded in 1895, recorded total revenues last year of
Dollars 391.3m, compared with Dollars 306.1m in 1990. The dollar figures
were calculated using exchange rates in effect at the end of each year.
One of the most widely-held and actively-traded shares on the Caracas Stock
Exchange, the company supplies electricity to the Caracas metropolitan area.
Last year, it participated in the international consortium which paid
Dollars 1.89bn for a 40 per cent equity holding in Venezuela's national
telephone company, CANTV, now privatised. La Electricidad's shares ranked
among the biggest gainers on the Venezuelan market last year.
The company, widely respected for its professional management, may face new
problems since the government recently ordered a halt to planned price
increases in response to widespread discontent with increasing rates for
utilities and public services.
The government, in the middle of a political and military crisis, has
suggested that the rate freeze - which also affects state-owned power
companies - will be only temporary.
The current administration is scheduled to complete its five-year term in
February 1994.
