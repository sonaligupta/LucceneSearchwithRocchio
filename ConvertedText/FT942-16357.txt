FT  11 APR 94 / Observer: Irish conspiracy


A fresh twist to the speculation about why Ireland's European commissioner
is throwing his weight behind Sir Leon Brittan's bid for the Commission
presidency.
One suggestion is that Padraig Flynn may be doing it because he wants to
secure a plum job. However, old Dublin hands speculate that his support for
Sir Leon has more to do with a concern to keep his current job. For some
reason Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is keen to be helpful to
Britain at the moment. By supporting Sir Leon, Flynn keeps in Reynolds's
good books and increases his chances of being reappointed.
Why should he be worried? Because Peter Sutherland is getting itchy feet as
director-general of Gatt and, despite denials, could be a runner for Delors'
job. If he got it, Flynn would have to make way since Ireland can only have
one commissioner. Stranger things have happened.
