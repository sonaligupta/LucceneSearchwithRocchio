   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


RECESSION in the world airline industry was underscored yesterday when
Boeing, the leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft, reported a 9 per
cent drop in third-quarter earnings.
The Seattle-based company reported net earnings of Dollars 364m, or Dollars
1.07 a share, compared to Dollars 401m, or Dollars 1.17, in the third
quarter of last year. Sales were down 10 per cent at Dollars 6.9bn.
Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, noted that some airline customers had asked to
reschedule orders and option delivery positions. But some of the negotiated
deferred deliveries had been offset by new orders and requests by other
customers to accelerate deliveries.
The company's firm backlog of orders at the end of the quarter stood at
Dollars 93bn, down from Dollars 97.9bn at the end of 1991.
Total announced orders for commercial jets for the first nine months were
valued at Dollars 11.5bn, down from Dollars 14.7bn in the same period of
last year. Orders for the year as a whole were expected to remain below the
1991 level 'but should result in Boeing maintaining a favourable market
share.'
For the first nine months, the company reported earnings of Dollars 1.26bn,
or Dollars 3.69 a share, on sales of Dollars 22.7bn, compared to earnings of
Dollars 1.16bn, or Dollars 3.39, in the same period of last year on sales of
Dollars 21.6bn. The group expects sales in calendar 1992 to total around
Dollars 30bn.
Boeing, which been spending heavily to develop its new 777 airliner, using
computer-aided design technology, said more than two-thirds of the
engineering design and planning requirements had now been released to
manufacturing.
Boeing, General Dynamics and Lockheed yesterday declined to comment on
reports in a newspaper in Fort Worth, Texas, that General Dynamics was
offering to sell its Fort Worth division, which makes the F-16 fighter
aircraft, to Boeing or Lockheed. The unit is scheduled to build the
Pentagon's next generation fighter, the F-22, in conjunction with Lockheed
and Boeing.
