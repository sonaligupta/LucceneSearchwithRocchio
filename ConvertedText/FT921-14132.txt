FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: IRI poised to take over state's
ASST

IRI, the Italian state holding company, was yesterday poised to gain
parliamentary approval to take over ASST, the government department which
runs Italy's trunk inter-urban phone service and some international links.
The reform follows the government's recent approval for a new 'price cap'
structure for SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, which is part of the IRI
group. The 'price cap' will allow SIP to raise call charges and equipment
rentals automatically each year, subject to certain performance criteria.
Together, the two steps should enable SIP, which reported a 54 per cent rise
in last year's first-half operating profits to L604.5bn (Dollars 506m), to
raise earnings further.
Yesterday's parliamentary debate marks a major step in the realignment of
Italian telecommunications. Under the new law, ASST is likely to be
transfered to STET, the IRI-owned holding company which controls much of the
country's telecommunications services.
In time, the functions of ASST, which is currently part of the post
ministry, will be handed over to SIP. The division of responsibilities
between the two, and internal rivalries, have been among the biggest
handicaps to a more efficient telephone service in Italy.
The new law also provides guarantees for ASST's 18,000 workers, who will
theoretically lose their jobs-for-life guarantee as civil servants should
they accept the transfer to IRI.
