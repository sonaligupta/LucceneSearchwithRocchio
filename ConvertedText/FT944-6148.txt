FT  30 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Provisions leave BDA with deficit of Pounds
545,000


BDA Holdings, the property investment and development group whose former
chairman, Mr Brian Duker, was ousted from the board in August, swung into
the red with a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 545,000 for the six months to July
31.
The outcome, against profits of Pounds 28,000, was struck after provisions
for a number of items including professional costs in respect of an abortive
merger and costs associated with the removal of Mr Duker.
Mr Richard Wollenberg, BDA's new chairman, said the group had achieved a
break-even trading position. However provisions left an operating loss of
Pounds 499,000.
Turnover was Pounds 711,000 (Pounds 1.03m) and interest costs were Pounds
46,000 (Pounds 47,000 credits). Losses per share emerged at 3.01p (0.15p
earnings).
