FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT election share watch


STRONGER performances by shares that might benefit from a Conservative win
continued yesterday. As the FT-SE index dropped by nearly 1 per cent,
'Conservative gainers' dropped by less than a third of that and 'Labour
gainers' dropped by more than  1/2 a percentage point. The movement cast
some doubt on the index's performance because the FT-SE drop followed an
opinion poll suggesting Labour was well placed to win vital marginal seats
in London.
