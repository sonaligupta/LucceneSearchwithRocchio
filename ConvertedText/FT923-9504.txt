FT  05 AUG 92 / More refinancing sought in Wales


   By ANTHONY MORETON


MANY small companies in rural mid-Wales are finding trading conditions 'very
tight' in the recession, Mr Glyn Davies, chairman of the Development Board
for Rural Wales, said yesterday.
Presenting the board's annual report, he said: 'We are receiving more
requests for refinancing packages. Inward investment is difficult to attract
and those considering a move to mid-Wales are taking much longer to reach a
decision.'
The development board, which was set up 15 years ago, said recently it had
branched away from its original strategy of encouraging manufacturing
industry in the area.
Mr Davies said: 'We previously concentrated on building advance factories
for potential incomers but we are increasingly turning towards the
allocation of finance out of our Pounds 27.8m annual budget towards
development money for existing companies.
'We are also placing more emphasis on building factories to demand rather
than putting up sheds speculatively and then looking for a tenant.'
