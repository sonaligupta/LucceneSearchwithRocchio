FT  13 NOV 93 / CIA to open up Dollars 1bn spy satellite picture market


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The CIA is ending its blanket opposition to commercial sales of spy-quality
satellite pictures in a move that may open a Dollars 1bn market in the next
few years, Reuter reports from Washington.
Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey is to announce
conditional support next week for allowing the use of 'remote-sensing'
systems capable of picking out objects as small as cars from 400 miles in
space.
The matter has been under review for more than a year, delaying among other
things, reported requests by Spain, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates
to buy US spy satellites.
Officials said Mr Woolsey had decided to support industry proposals for the
sale of imagery sharp enough to distinguish ground objects as small as one
metre in diameter. But Mr Woolsey remained wary of allowing overseas sales
of the hardware itself for fear that unrestricted availability of
spy-quality images could endanger national security if it fell into hostile
hands.
US companies are banned from using satellites to gather pictures beyond a
certain measure of sharpness, except as part of highly classified
reconnaissance work for intelligence agencies and the Defence Department.
Mr John McMahon, president of Lockheed Missiles, estimated the proposed spy
picture business would add at least Dollars 1bn in sales and generate 30,000
jobs in the US.
