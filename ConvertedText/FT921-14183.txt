FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Untouchables on the virus trail


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


COMPUTER viruses are never far from the headlines, but as new ones are
identified and confounded, more pernicious ones are already worming their
way into corporate PCs.
To thwart the virus creator, Fifth Generation Systems, of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, has developed a piece of software which enables the PC user to
stay one step ahead of viruses, rather than running one pace behind.
When the Untouchable anti-virus software is loaded on to the PC it
identifies and eradicates any existing viruses. Then the software copies a
signature of all the files that are held on the PC. If a new virus enters
the system - even those that have not previously been identified - the
characteristics of this signature will change in a number of ways. This will
enable Untouchable to identify the presence of a virus before it can do any
damage. The software can be used with any PC running under the Dos operating
system.
