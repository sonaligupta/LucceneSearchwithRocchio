FT  19 APR 94 / Unfair dismissal limit challenged


Two women office workers yesterday asked the High Court to rule that the
1985 legislation raising the qualification period for unfair dismissal
claims from one to two years' employment was illegal.
Mr Robin Allen, their counsel, claimed the law was in breach of the European
equal treatment directive as the proportion of women disadvantaged by the
changes was significantly larger than the proportion of men.
