FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Poor building data outweigh
positive news


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US SHARE prices finished slightly lower in light trading yesterday after
some disappointing news from the housing and construction markets had
outweighed good news elsewhere, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.51 at 3,282.20. The Standard &
Poor's 500 ended a touch easier, off 0.06 at 411.54, and the Nasdaq
composite softened 0.88 to 564.73. New York SE turnover was only 165m
shares.
The day's only economic news was broadly negative. The National Association
of Realtors announced a 2.9 per cent fall in June existing home sales, while
the Commerce Department revised its June building estimates down to 2.1 per
cent from 1.3 per cent.
The figures proved to be rather more of an influence on sentiment than the
good news of the apparent resolution of a confrontation between Iraq and the
UN, lower Japanese interest rates, and some selected strong second quarter
corporate results.
Among the stocks buoyed early on by good earnings figures was Goodyear,
which rose more than Dollars 1 at the start, but receded later with the
market to end down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 after news of second
quarter net income of Dollars 1.54 a share, up sharply from last year,
although the figures were partly boosted by special items.
Stanhome advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 on second quarter earnings
of 57 cents a share, up from 47 cents a year ago and slightly higher than
the average of analysts' forecasts.
ADRs in Wellcome, the UK drugs group, made their debut, finishing at Dollars
15 1/4 in turnover of 14.2m, making the stock the day's leading active. Drug
issues were generally firmer in the wake of the Wellcome issue. Merck
advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 7/8 in turnover of 1.8m shares, Johnson
& Johnson Dollars 1 to Dollars 47 1/8 and Pfizer Dollars 1 to Dollars 76 3/8
.
IMC Fertiliser climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 41 after Dean Witter
Reynolds, the Wall Street brokerage, upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to an
'aggressive buy'.
Varian Associates shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 35 3/4 on news of a sharp
decline in fiscal third quarter income that came in below market estimates.
On the Nasdaq market, Novell fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 52 after Dean Witter
downgraded its investment rating from a 'buy' to a 'hold', citing domestic
business worries.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed on a mixed note after quiet trading. The TSE 300 index
lost 4.4 to 3,396.5, but advances narrowly led declines by 254 to 249 on
volume of 19.2m shares.
Inco, off CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 36 1/2 , reported a second-quarter loss
of 3 US cents a share, against a year-earlier profit of 28 cents.
