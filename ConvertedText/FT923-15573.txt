FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine to spell out DTI
'relaunch' plan


   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor


A RESTRUCTURING of the Department of Trade and Industry to sponsor the
country's main industrial sectors will be announced by Mr Michael Heseltine
on Friday.
The president of the board of trade is planning to 'relaunch' his department
as industry's champion in Whitehall in the wake of last month's announcement
of the abolition of the National Economic Development Council.
Mr Heseltine has not secured additional funding from the Treasury for the
restructuring; and he will insist that he has no intention of returning to
the interventionist policies of the 1960s and 1970s,
But in a speech to staff he is expected to emphasise that the government's
free-market economic framework allows room for an active government role in
promoting and assisting individual industries.
An accompanying video to be sent to industrialists is expected to emphasise
that government help will include a renewed drive across Whitehall to remove
bureaucratic interference and excessive regulation.
Mr Heseltine, who has been combing through a sector-by-sector analysis of
Britain's trade performance, also wants to emphasise his role as industry's
sponsor in Europe and in other world markets.
He intends to strengthen his department's detailed knowledge of industry's
difficulties by establishing at least a dozen sectoral groups - ranging from
chemicals to electronics - to represent their industries' interests in
Whitehall. Some of the groups are expected to be staffed by officials
leaving the office which services the development council.
His critics are expected to characterise the reorganisation as a
public-relations exercise, but Mr Heseltine regards it as the first step in
his planned transformation of the government's relations with industry.
