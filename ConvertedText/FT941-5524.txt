FT  05 MAR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: Setting losses against gains


My wife and I have a portfolio of shares in unit trusts. Most are in my name
but some are in joint names and some in hers.
'Capital gains' losses are of no value to her tax position because the level
of gains so far has been minimal. But the sale of some joint holdings this
tax year constitute losses on the indexed basis prior to last December, and
I would like to maximise use of these against gains made in my name. The
securities were purchased before the separate tax arrangements for wives
were introduced.
Is it possible for me to use the whole of these losses in my tax return, or
shall I be restricted to 50 per cent.
In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary (which presumably does not
exist in your case), it will be assumed that spouses have equal beneficial
interests in investments registered in their joint names. The answer,
therefore, is that only half the losses on the joint holdings are yours.
No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the

soon as possible.
