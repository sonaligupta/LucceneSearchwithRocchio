FT  05 JUN 92 / Engineering graduates trail


BRITAIN'S supply of engineering graduates is well below that of its main
competitors, according to a report by the Engineering Council.
A Liverpool University study shows that between 1983 and 1988 the output of
home students graduating in engineering subjects was only half that of
Germany (11,700 against 22,200), and 15 per cent to 20 per cent that of
Japan (63,900) and the US (87,300).
