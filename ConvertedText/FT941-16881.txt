FT  07 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): How to keep lager bubbly on top


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Soon after a glass of lager is poured the appealing bubbles on the top begin
to dissipate. Once the beer is inside the smooth-sided glass the carbon
dioxide remains dissolved in the fluid, rather than bursting to the top to
form bubbles.
A specialist glass company has found a way to roughen the inside base of the
glass so the carbon dioxide is released. Charles Glassware fixes glass
particles into the base and fires the glass at 580'C. The particles may form
a picture or logo. Charles Glassware: UK, 081 207 2888.
