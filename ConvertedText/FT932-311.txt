FT  29 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Further fall in bond yields
boosts stocks

Wall Street
FURTHER DECLINES in bond yields, which dropped to historic lows mid-morning,
helped US stocks post big gains across the board, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.31 at 3,530.20. The
more broadly based Standard&Poor's 500 ended 4.25 higher at 451.85, while
the Amex composite was up 2.29 at 432.86, and the Nasdaq composite up 8.01
rose to 702.82. Trading volume on the NYSE was 242m shares, and rises
outnumbered declines by a ratio of more than two to one.
Once again, a buoyant bond market provided support for equities at a time
when the fundamentals for the stock markets are anything but positive.
Although concern about sluggish economic growth has undermined stocks, it
has provided a fresh boost to bond prices. Yesterday the benchmark 30-year
bond rose another  1/2 of a point, sending the yield down to 6.667 per cent,
the lowest it has been since 1977, when the Treasury began issuing 30-year
bonds on a regular basis.
Low interest rates cheered investors because they reduce the cost of
corporate borrowing and stimulate interest in equities, particularly through
the mutual fund industry, which has benefited from huge inflows of investor
cash ever since rates began to decline two-and-a-half years ago.
The political news was also positive for stocks, with investors welcoming
President Bill Clinton's decision to attack Iraq's intelligence headquarters
as retaliation for the alleged attempt to assassinate former President
George Bush. Analysts said that the missile strike on Iraq would revive
confidence in Mr Clinton.
Falling interest rates lifted bank stocks: Citicorp rose Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 30, Chemical put on Dollars 1 at Dollars 41 7/8 , Chase Manhattan
firmed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 1/2 , Banc One added Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 56 3/4 and BankAmerica rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 .
Brokerage companies, another sector which benefits greatly from falling
rates, were also higher. Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 80 3/4
, Morgan Stanley climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 68 1/2 and Primerica, which
owns Smith Barney Shearson, surged Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 .
Leading technology stocks were also in demand. IBM firmed Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 50 1/2 , Motorola added Dollars 2 at Dollars 88 1/8 , Digital
Equipment climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 , Unisys put on Dollars
1/2 at Dollars 12 1/8 , and Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 83
3/8 .
Northern Telecom crashed Dollars 8 1/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 in volume of 2.1m
shares as investors reacted to Friday's late profits warning from the
Canadian telecommunications group.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed sharply lower in relatively moderate trading, as
concerns about the earnings prospects of Northern Telecom sent the
telecommunications giant's shares tumbling.
According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index fell 26.32
points, or 0.66 per cent, to close at 3,965.45. Declining issues outnumbered
advances 425 to 333.
Northern Telecom plunged CDollars 10 1/4 to CDollars 37 1/8 on volume of
more than 1.9m shares. BCE Inc., Northern Telecom's parent and the composite
index's most-heavily weighted stock, lost CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 44.
