FT  29 JAN 92 / Hanson duo keeps City guessing on successors


Lord Hanson (left) yesterday yesterday emphatically ruled out a bid for
Imperial Chemical Industries eight months after taking a 2.8 per cent stake
in the company. He told shareholders of the acquisitive conglomerate that
bears his name that arrangements had been made for the succession to him and
Lord White (pictured), who runs the group's North American operations, but
he refused to name the heir apparent. More than 1,000 shareholders attended
Hanson's annual meeting in the Barbican Centre in London. Most questions had
to be submitted in writing before the meeting, enabling Lord Hanson to read
the answers from an autocue.
