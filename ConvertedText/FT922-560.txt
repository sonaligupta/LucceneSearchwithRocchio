FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BPB Industries


There has been a two way pull in BPB's shares recently - but by yesterday
evening it was advantage to the bulls. In abnormally heavy trading the price
jumped 6 per cent as investors reacted to a maintained, albeit only half
covered dividend, and a relatively upbeat recovery statement from the new
chief executive.
BPB has been guilty of unfounded optimism before - so the market is showing
a touching faith in believing that the worst is really now over. True,
Europe's big three producers cannot indefinitely slug it out with each other
in a quest for bigger shares, and neither Knauf nor Lafarge-Coppee will have
been making much money out of gypsum at recent prices. That said, one has to
wonder whether this year's price increases - 10 to 15 per cent in France and
Germany and 8 per cent in the UK - can really be made to stick. The
prospects are brightest in Germany where at least there ought to be some
boost to volumes in 1992. In France and the UK, however, it is hard to see
the industry's financially stretched contracting customers taking any new
price discipline lying down. Even a well established building material
oligopoly like the UK cement producers are finding margins under pressure
again.
The range of current year profit expectations - take your pick between
Pounds 45m to Pounds 70m - reflects the uncertainty. The question is whether
an 8.5 per cent yield adequately reflects the risks if the bulls turn out to
be wrong.
