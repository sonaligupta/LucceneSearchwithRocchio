FT  17 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Small potatoes hit the big time


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


THE problem for the horticulturist who has developed a new breed of potato
is that it can take years to breed enough of the vegetables to get them into
the shops. But a technique developed by scientists at the University of
Wisconsin, and licensed by Small Potatoes, of Madison, could speed up the
process.
Developers of the microtuber multiplication of potatoes process, which is
also being commercialised by Rayyan Nederland, of Aalsmeer, Holland, believe
the process can produce 30 tubers from a single parent 'seed' - about 20
times the rate of today's methods. This is done through the interplay of
light, temperature, the growing medium and gravity in proprietary
bioreactors.
The system requires only a low-cost growth environment - the only human
intervention is in inserting the original microtuber and harvesting the
result.
