FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Quantum Group plans to create
Dollars 1bn India fund


   By RICHARD LAPPER


The Quantum Group, managed by international financier Mr George Soros, is to
set up a new India fund, underlining recent growth in investor interest in
the country.
Mr Purnendu Chatterjee, who already advises Quantum, is assembling a team to
manage the fund, which is expected to be capitalised at Dollars 1bn.
'With the move by India away from government regulation and towards
integration into the world economy, a favourable investment climate has
emerged,' said Mr Soros in a letter to shareholders of an existing Quantum
fund.
Quantum India will reserve 20 per cent of its assets for so-called 'macros
trading', in currencies, bonds, stock indices and commodities.
The Quantum Group, based in the Netherlands Antilles, consists of open- and
closed-end investment funds.
