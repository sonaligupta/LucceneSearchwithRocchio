FT  29 JUL 92 / Clinton's critics score an own goal


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


A White House assault on Governor Bill Clinton's lack of experience in
foreign affairs appeared to have backfired yesterday.
A senior administration official said he had been discussing with allies the
course of action that President George Bush's spokesman had the previous day
cited as an example of the Democratic candidate's 'reckless' approach to
foreign policy.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, White House spokesman, spent much of Monday saying that
a statement by Mr Clinton on US policy in Bosnia-Hercegovina showed he
needed to 'do some more homework on foreign policy'.
Mr Fitzwater suggested that Mr Clinton wanted to bombard Bosnia - a somewhat
loose interpretation of the Democratic candidate's suggestion that the US
should seek authorisation from the UN Security Council for air strikes
against those attacking UN and non-governmental relief convoys in the
battered former Yugoslav republic.
Yesterday, however, Mr John Bolton, assistant secretary of state for
international organisations, said in Geneva that the US was consulting with
other powers on possible military action to protect the delivery of relief
aid to Bosnia.
Mr Bolton said the Bush administration did not favour military action 'at
this point,' but 'would support a Security Council resolution to authorise
the use of all necessary means to assure the delivery of humanitarian
assistance'.
While foreign affairs are clearly considered to be Mr Bush's strongest suit
in the November presidential election, Mr Clinton has carefully avoided any
faux pas on the subject.
His speeches at Georgetown University outlining his approach to foreign
policy were well received by diplomats and specialists.
Neither the speeches, nor the international plank of the Democratic party
platform agreed in New York this month, deviate significantly from
mainstream US foreign policy.
