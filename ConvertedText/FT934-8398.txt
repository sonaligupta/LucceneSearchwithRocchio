FT  16 NOV 93 / Ex-Levitt chief 'not competent' to defraud


   By JOHN MASON


MR MARK REED, former group managing director of the Levitt Group, the
collapsed financial services company, was too incompetent to be guilty of
fraud, Mr Brian Lett, defending, told the Old Bailey yesterday, John Mason
writes.
Mr Reed, Mr Roger Levitt, former chairman, and two other former directors,
Mr Alan McNamara and Mr Robert Price, all deny fraudulent trading by
producing bogus accounts to make the Levitt Group appear profitable.
Mr Lett said Mr Reed was a long-standing staff member kept on in spite of
not being up to the job. He signed cheques and spoke to the auditors and
Fimbra, the watchdog, Mr Lett said. However, his activities meant telling
others to do things he did not understand.
He spent much time trying to cut expenses - including chasing Mr Sebastian
Coe, the Tory MP, then a director of a Levitt subsidiary, about a parking
ticket and telling Mr Adam Faith, the entertainer and another subsidiary
director, why he could not have expensive curtains in his office.
The trial continues.
