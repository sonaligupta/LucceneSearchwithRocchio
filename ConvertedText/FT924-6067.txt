FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Bethlehem Steel sells wire
unit

BETHLEHEM Steel, the second biggest US steel group, has signed a letter of
intent to sell most of its bar, rod and wire operations to Ispat Mexicana, a
member of the Asian Ispat Group.
Under the terms of the deal, Ispat will acquire the entire operations apart
from the Johnstown wire mill, which Bethlehem has agreed to sell to TMB
Industries of Chicago.
Bethlehem said Ispat planned to follow a modernisation programme which would
essentially follow Bethlehem's earlier plans, including installing a
continuous caster and a rod block at the local plant to increase efficiency
and production capability.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The bar, rod and wire operations bring
in less than 10 per cent of Bethlehem's annual sales of roughly Dollars 4bn.
A Bethlehem spokesman said most of the bar, rod and wire operations were
being sold as a unit to preserve as many jobs as possible.
Tokyo Kyoei Steel, a medium-sized Osaka steelmaker affiliated to Sumitomo
Metal Industries, has suffered a setback in its plans to buy Florida Steel,
a US minimill, after only 54 per cent of bondholders responded to Florida
Steel's buy-back offer.
Kyoei's Dollars 343m offer for Florida Steel was contingent on 90 per cent
of the debentures being tendered. Kyoei has halted its efforts to raise
financing until a sufficient number of debentures are tendered. Either party
can terminate the deal if it is not closed by December 15.
