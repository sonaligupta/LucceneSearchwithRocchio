FT  25 AUG 92 / Exiled Queen may come home


   By TIM BURT


SEACONTAINERS, the UK shipping company, has joined the bidding for the Queen
Mary, the former flagship of the Cunard shipping line moored as a tourist
attraction at Long Beach, California.
The company last night pledged a Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 50,251) deposit to
the City of Long Beach, the ship's owner, which is looking for a buyer
following the decision by the Walt Disney entertainment group not to renew
its lease on the site near Los Angeles.
Seacontainers, which will announce its bid formally today, is forming a new
company  - RMS Queen Mary  - to bring the 1,019ft-vessel back to
Southampton, her home port from where she sailed to Long Beach on October 31
1967.
Mr James Sherwood, company chairman, said a statement would be issued on the
project today after expiry of the deadline for bids in Long Beach last
night.
Seacontainers hopes further surveys and negotiations with Long Beach will
lead to the Queen Mary's return to the UK, where she could be redeveloped as
a conference centre, hotel and casino.
Seacontainers is thought to be one of four international bidders interested
in the 81,232-ton liner. Long Beach Harbour Commission last night said at
least 12 proposals had been received for the vessel.
Of the international bids, only one involves British backers. The others are
thought to include a scheme to tow the vessel to Japan where she could be
refurbished as an office block.
The liner was put on the market after Walt Disney decided it could no longer
afford the mounting maintenance costs. Disney is thought to have lost
Dollars 5m a year since it leased the vessel in 1988 as a floating hotel and
museum.
The Southampton-based Queen Mary Project welcomed last night's bid.
