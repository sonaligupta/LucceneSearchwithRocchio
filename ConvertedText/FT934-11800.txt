FT  29 OCT 93 / Observer: One of us?


Has Philippe Maystadt got the right man? The Belgian finance minister has
been loudly singing the praises of Alexandre Lamfalussy, who will today be
confirmed as the first president of the European Monetary Institute. He has
found, he thinks, a 'true believer' in a single European currency.
Maystadt has also been at pains to point out how Lamfalussy, general manager
of the Bank for International Settlements, compares favourably with certain
sceptical European central bank governors.
But did he not read last year's BIS report, in which Lamfalussy's
hard-hitting comments on monetary union conveyed the impression of a man
less than wholly enthusiastic about the Emu endeavour? Then, the author was
not shy of enumerating the long list of 'adjustment problems' that would be
involved in moving to a single currency by the end of the century, or of
giving ample treatment to the 'many uncertainties' that lay ahead.
Indeed, so waspish was he deemed to have been on that occasion that he
earned a rebuke from the president of the Dutch central bank. Wim Duisenberg
is the man who, despite being France and Germany's favourite for the EMI
job, turned it down because it wasn't big enough for him. Perhaps Maystadt
should have tried one more heave to bring Duisenberg aboard.
