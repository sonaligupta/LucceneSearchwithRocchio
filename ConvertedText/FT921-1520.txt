FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Export sales move ahead at Gabicci


Recession in the domestic market resulted in a 20 per cent contraction in
interim profits at Gabicci, the USM-quoted casual wear group.
However, Mr Jack Sofier, chairman, said that the group's export sales had
continued to expand.
The pre-tax line amounted to Pounds 538,000 for the half year to December
19, down from Pounds 676,000 last time. Turnover fell some 12 per cent at
Pounds 11m.
Earnings worked through at 3.1p (3.8p) but the interim dividend is
maintained at 1.4p.
