FT  28 JUL 92 / Revolt brewing in Kosovo


   By REUTER


   PARIS


The leader of ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo has said a
revolt brewing there could result in a tragedy greater than that in Bosnia,
Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Ibrahim Rugova told Figaro newspaper that he
believed a popular revolt could erupt in Kosovo, where the majority Albanian
population is seeking to break with Serbia.
Mr Rugova, elected president of Kosovo in clandestine elections in May, said
he did not rule out his Democratic League taking up arms against Serbia,
which has stripped the province of its autonomy. 'But because we lack
weapons, it would be difficult to organise,' he said.
Kosovo's 1.9m ethnic Albanians outnumber other nationalities, including
Serbs, 10 to one. Serbia accuses them of wanting to annex the province to
neighbouring Albania. More than 100 people have been killed in unrest in
Kosovo since March 1989, but Mr Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders
have urged civil disobedience instead of demonstrations which invariably
result in violence.
