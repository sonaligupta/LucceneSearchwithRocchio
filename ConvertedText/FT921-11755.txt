FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser Dollars 161.9m in
red for year


   By REUTER


WEYERHAEUSER, the US timber products group, has suffered a loss amid
conditions which include the lowest rate in US housing starts since the
Second World War, Reuter reports.
The company posted a 1991 year-end loss of Dollars 161.9m, or 80 cents a
share, including a Dollars 283m fourth-quarter restructuring charge and a
Dollars 61m accounting change charge. Revenues fell to Dollars 8.7bn from
Dollars 9.02bn in 1990.
In 1990, the company earned Dollars 393.7m, or Dollars 1.87 a share.
The company also cited a 20 per cent drop in Japanese housing starts in
1991, falling prices in all leading pulp and product lines, and a property
market in turmoil as reasons for its lower results.
In the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser's pulp and paper earnings were down 85
per cent.
