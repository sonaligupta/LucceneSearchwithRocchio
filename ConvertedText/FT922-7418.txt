FT  19 MAY 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


One of the characteristics of really good art is that it has something to
say to virtually everybody. Even though Anglo-Saxon Attitudes is set largely
in the 1950s and primarily concerned with a relatively small part of the
English middle class, it will impinge upon and throw light upon the lives of
a far larger group. Indeed, what it has to say about human relationships
must be well nigh universal. In today's episode (ITV 8.30) Gerald goes to
France seeking confirmation of his suspicions about the Melpham phallus.
Having dealt with punters and 'lads' (those men and women of all ages who
look after racehorses) BBC2's documentary The Racing Game moves on to
jockeys. Even for someone with no knowledge of the racing scene this is an
attractive series, though it does seem to have been made just as the entire
business is going under, at least in England (9.50). BBC1 begins yet another
documentary series about sport though this time with a wider brief. More
Than A Game promises to examine the state of sport as a whole.
In Viewpoint 92 (ITV 10.40) John Pilger pronounces upon third world debt and
third world aid.
