FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Properties improves


CHESTERFIELD Properties displayed a 'modest recovery' in profitability in
the first half of 1992, but in view of economic uncertainties the interim
dividend is halved to 3.5p.
Turnover moved up to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 18.4m) and pre-tax revenue came to
Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.37m) for earnings per share of 5.48p (0.75p).
In the equivalent period of 1990 the profit was Pounds 7.84m.
The main reason for the improvement was an increase in rental income from
Pounds 16m to Pounds 17.9m.
Profits from the operation of West End theatres fell sharply, the impact of
economic conditions being aggravated by fewer American visitors.
Directors pointed out that the level of interest rates would be the factor
exerting by far the largest influence on future profitability.
A secondary one would be the cumulative impact of bankruptcies among smaller
tenants, which was increasingly noticeable as the recession deepened.
