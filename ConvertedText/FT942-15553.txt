FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: Finmeccanica unit in US deal

Elsag Bailey Process Automation, a subsidiary of Finmeccanica, the Italian
state-controlled engineering group, is to buy Fischer & Porter, a US
manufacturer of measurement and control products, for Dollars 158m, after
outbidding one of Fischer's competitors.
Elsag Bailey Process Automation, which makes process automation and
numerical control equipment, yesterday announced an offer of Dollars 24.25
for each Fischer & Porter share. The bid has been accepted by Fischer &
Porter.
It is the first important deal for the Finmeccanica subsidiary since 40 per
cent of its shares were floated on the New York stock exchange last
December.
The Elsag Bailey offer beats, by Dollars 1 a share, the bid tabled last
month by Moorco International, a Houston-based maker of fluid measurement
and pressure-control products, which valued Fischer & Porter at about
Dollars 150m.
Finmeccanica, based in Rome, explained that the deal would add control
system components - particularly in flow measurement - to the central
systems which Elsag Bailey already manufactures, and increase the
geographical spread of its products, notably in Germany.
Finmeccanica said this would allow the subsidiary to rationalise its
production, distribution and administrative structure.
In 1993, Fischer & Porter reported net profits of Dollars 1.1m on turnover
of Dollars 222m.
Elsag Bailey Process Automation, assisted in the deal by a consortium of US
banks, recorded net profits of Dollars 21.6m on revenue of Dollars 606m for
1993.
