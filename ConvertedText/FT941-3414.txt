FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Paterson Zochonis rises 15%


Paterson Zochonis, the detergents manufacturer, was bullish yesterday about
prospects as it announced a 15 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits
to Pounds 13.6m.
The increase was achieved on sales 3 per cent ahead to Pounds 126m for the
six months to November 30.
The company said it was confident that, barring any unexpected currency
movements, it would increase profits from last time's Pounds 25.3m in the
year to May 31. The interim dividend was increased by 4 per cent to 2.45p.
Earnings were 18 per cent higher at 17.69p.
During the first half, profits were helped by lower interest charges, an
increased contribution from associates and an improved operating return.
Interest charges fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 2.74m, while the contribution
from associates rose by Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 1.83m.
The company said trading in parts of Africa was becoming increasingly
difficult, particularly in Nigeria, the Congo and Cameroun.
In Europe, Paterson increased sales of Cussons soaps and toiletries in a
competitive market. The Polish detergents manufacturer returned an
encouraging performance, the company said.
