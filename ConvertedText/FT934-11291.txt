FT  02 NOV 93 / N Korea slated over inspection

NORTH KOREA'S failure to comply with international nuclear safeguards 'has
been widening' and continuity of some data was already damaged, the head of
the UN inspection's body said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns in New
York.
Dr Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
said the longer verification was blocked the less assurance there could be
that even North Korea's 'declared facilities' were for peaceful uses.
Reporting to the UN General Assembly, he rejected Pyongyang's attempt at
piecemeal verification, saying that inspection must be an integral whole.
As he addressed the UN, the North Korean delegation published the text of a
message agreeing to inspection 'for the purpose of maintenance and
replacement of the safeguards' equipment.' As for routine and random
inspections proposed by IAEA, these would depend on progress in talks now
being held with the US and on the agency's own attitude, which currently was
one of 'partiality and injustice'.
With North Korea casting the sole negative vote, the General Assembly urged
Pyongyang, by 140 votes to 1, to co-operate immediately with the IAEA.
