FT  23 JUL 93 / Nadir friends in protest


   By RACHEL JOHNSON and RICHARD DONKIN


FRIENDS OF Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman, have started what
appears to be a concerted campaign against the handling of the case mounted
against him by the Serious Fraud Office.
Within hours of publication by Mr Nadir of a 60-page dossier of court
transcripts and other documents, bound by the UK's strict sub judice laws, a
group of British-based Turkish Cypriots began demonstrating outside Downing
Street.
One demonstrator, Mr Mustafa Gencsoy, chairman of the Turkish Association of
Cyprus, said the 50-strong demonstration yesterday morning was orchestrated
by the All-Turks Legal Support Group.
Mr Gencsoy said Turkish Cypriots were upset by the British authorities'
handling of the case over the past three years and said the evidence
contained in Mr Michael Mates' speech to parliament justified their
feelings.
Mr Mehmet Oguz, a ship engineer who runs the group, said the demonstration
was his idea. 'I feel he's innocent, I want to support him so I called my
friends together.' He denied that there was a link between the release of
the dossier and the gathering.
Scotland Yard said yesterday that three items formerly owned by Mr Nadir
were taken in a burglary on Wednesday from Christie's, the auctioneers, in
central London.
