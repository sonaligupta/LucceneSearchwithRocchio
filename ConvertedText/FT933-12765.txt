FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Eve Group improves 27% to Pounds 4.15m


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


PRE-TAX profits of Eve Group, the specialist contractor, jumped by 27 per
cent from Pounds 3.26m to Pounds 4.15m during the 12 months to the end of
March - in spite of enduring the 'worst construction industry recession for
half a century.'
The company has increased dividend payments every year since it floated on
the USM in 1986. The final dividend this time is raised to 7.3p making a
total of 10p (9.7p) for the year.
Following the better-than-expected results, the shares rose 23p to 400p.
Profits would have been even higher but for a Pounds 500,000 provision
against its commercial property interests. Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m
to Pounds 53m while earnings per share increased by more than a fifth from
22.5p to 27.4p.
The outcome also included Pounds 265,000 representing five months' profits
from Graham Bros, the Middlesbrough-based specialist electrical contracting
and engineering company, acquired last autumn.
Eve's strength is its specialist contracting division, which is one of only
a handful of companies carrying out work for the National Grid Company,
erecting transmission lines and pylons. The division also erects
transmission towers for radio, telecommunications and television companies.
The division's turnover and profits have remained strong in spite of
recession in the rest of the construction industry, which has prompted a
sharp fall in margins in Eve's general building business.
Construction profits, which includes specialist contracting and general
building, rose by a quarter from Pounds 3.15m to Pounds 3.95m. This was
despite a fall in the division's profit margins from 8.6 per cent to 8.2 per
cent, said Mr Gerald Hough, managing director.
Profits from Trakway, which provides portable roadways for construction
sites, exhibitions and concerts, rose from Pounds 656,000 to Pounds 2.88m,
helped by an increase in pop concert work, said Mr Hough.
Property development losses rose from Pounds 104,000 to Pounds 576,000 after
the Pounds 500,000 provision.
Construction industry analysts said they expected the group to make profits
of at least Pounds 5m this year, provided there were no further provisions.
