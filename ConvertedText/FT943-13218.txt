FT  21 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Euro-follies


The newly elected European Parliament has got off to an unpromising start.
By vetoing this week legislation to liberalise European voice telephony, the
parliament has threatened a programme vital to industrial competitiveness
and thereby diminished its own standing.
There appear to be three main reasons for the decision: confusion among
MEPs, some of whom apparently did not realise what they were voting on;
concern that liberalisation would raise residential telephone charges; and a
broadly shared desire to demonstrate institutional parity with the European
Commission and Council of Ministers.
Only the first explanation is readily acceptable, on the grounds that many
MEPs are still inexperienced. The second is understandable, but
wrong-headed. Technology and competition are rapidly eroding the monopoly
profit structure which has long subsidised residential telephone services.
Thwarting liberalisation will simply impede the European telecommunications
industry's adjustment to market realities.
The sorriest aspect of the affair is that the parliament seems to think it
can command respect by setting its face against economic progress. Using its
powers in this way is a disservice to the electorate, whose interests it
claims to represent, and invites charges of frivolity. With luck, the
telecom-munications package can be reassembled soon. On current form,
repairing the damage to confidence in the parliament's legislative wisdom
may take rather longer.
