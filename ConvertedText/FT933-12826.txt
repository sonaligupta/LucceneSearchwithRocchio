ITV's imported series Voyager, made by National Geographic Films, follows
climber Tim Macartney-Snape as he sets out to become the first person to
conquer Everest on foot, from sea level to summit, solo and without oxygen.
(Next year with a blindfold? A tea tray balanced on his nose?) Among the
hazards are rabid dogs and the need to swim the Ganges (7.30).
In Business Matters David Lomax reports from China's southernmost province,
Guangdong, which has a population of 65m and, it is claimed, the fastest
growing economy in the world: according to the World Bank last year's growth
rate was 24 per cent.
Lomax asks whether China's open door policy has led to increasing crime and
corruption and whether the government can control the number of immigrants
pouring in (7.50).
BBC1 begins one of several American mini-series inspired by the notorious
case in which a married woman and a schoolboy had a passionate affair and
the boy then murdered the woman's husband: Stay The Night (9.30).
