FT  02 NOV 93 / Romania 'pyramid' payments delayed


   By REUTER


   BUCHAREST


A pyramid investment company which launched a money-spinning craze in
Romania said yesterday it had suspended payments to investors for two days
because of 'organisational problems' but denied reports it was about to
collapse, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
The Caritas company described as unfounded a wave of local press stories
saying the money chain was losing momentum and that it would soon grind to a
halt. 'It is true Caritas suspended payments for two days,' a company
official told Reuter by telephone from Cluj. 'But this was only because the
company wants to organise its work better.'
It was the second time in a month that Caritas has interrupted payments for
several days. More than 4m Romanians have billions of lei tied up in the
scheme, which works like a chain-letter game and promises depositors a
return of eight times their initial deposits after just three months.
This has captured the imagination of a nation where monthly pay rarely
reaches Pounds 40, the annual inflation rate runs at almost 300 per cent and
bank interest rates lag behind at 70 per cent.
