FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Reversing property spiral


   From Mr M A MOORE


Sir, Vanessa Houlder's article on the UK property market ('Towers of
strength turn to pillars of sand', April 2) makes no mention of regional
differences in the UK and no mention of areas, such as here in south Wales,
where we are assisted by the pro-active Welsh Development Agency and by
positive council assistance in certain office and industrial developments.
Given realistic banking support, we, as developers, can counter the problems
London and the south-east face by offering bankers developments they feel
'safe' with, end-users a realistically priced product, investors a
satisfactory yield and workers a superb environment.
Unfortunately the well publicised problems of several developers in London,
our current political insecurity, the banks' perceived exposure to property
generally and our innate ability to look inward, conspire to produce a
downward spiral. Surely it is within our capabilities to reverse the
position, particularly here in areas such as south Wales.
