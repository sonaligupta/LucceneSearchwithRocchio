FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Air France predicts FFr3.7bn
loss

Air France plans to limit losses to FFr3.7bn (Dollars 627m) in the financial
year, a sharp reduction from the FFr8.48bn deficit suffered in 1993, Mr
Christian Blanc, chairman, said yesterday.
The state-owned airline is changing its reporting period to bring it into
line with other members of the International Air Transport Association.
The predicted FFr3.7bn loss will therefore cover the period from January 1
this year to the end of March 1995.
The prediction followed confirmation of a sharp deterioration in the
airline's results for last year.
The company said '1993 was the darkest year for Air France'. The downturn
was blamed on several factors, including overcapacity in the airline
industry, the impact of recession and the effects of damaging strikes last
October.
Turnover declined by 3.6 per cent to FFr55.16bn, with the main air transport
business shrinking by about 6 per cent to FFr42.71bn.
Passenger traffic was flat compared with 1992 while freight traffic fell by
about 4.1 per cent. Financial charges rose by more than 60 per cent to
FFr3.51bn and there was a FFr1.8bn charge taken for restructuring measures.
The expected improvement in results this year is to be achieved partly
through the implementation of a recovery package and, to a lesser extent,
through improved market conditions.
Mr Blanc has won approval from the airline's 40,000 staff for a package of
measures which include 5,000 job cuts, a freeze on wages and promotions and
a reorganisation of the group structure.
The airline has also been pledged a FFr20bn capital injection from the
French government over the next three years which will ease its debt burden.
Air France said that passenger traffic had increased in the first quarter of
the year, rising by 19.9 per cent over the same period in 1993.
In March, the number of passengers rose by 23 per cent and the rate of
occupancy of Air France aircraft rose by almost 10 percentage points to 74.9
per cent.
However, the increase in passengers has largely been achieved by
price-cutting measures aimed at winning back passengers after last October's
strikes. As a result, the increases have not yet fed through into higher
profits.
The airline suffered a further blow this week with the decision by the
European Commission to order the French government to allow competition on
three routes serving Orly airport in Paris.
