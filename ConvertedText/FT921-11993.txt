FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Genbel beats mining setback


   By PHILIP GAWITH

GENBEL, the investment arm of South Africa's second largest mining house,
Gencor, overcame declining earnings in its mining and resource-based
investments to lift earnings and dividends by 11 per cent in the six months
to the end of December.
Distributable income rose to R82.3m (Dollars 29.4m) from R74.5m, equivalent
to a rise in earnings per share from 17.1 cents to 19 cents. The dividend
was lifted to 15 cents from 13.5 cents. Earnings for the full year are
expected to be above last year's.
Mr Anton Botha, managing director, said the performance was creditable
considering the fact that 44 per cent of Genbel's assets were still
mining-related. This follows an active realignment of Genbel's investment
portfolio in recent years, particularly away from gold and into other
resource-based equities.
Mr Botha said that to be able to fulfil one of Genbel's primary roles,
namely as financing partner to Gencor, it would probably have to raise
additional capital. This would be in order to participate in some of the
existing, or prospective, large capital projects in the group, such as the
Oryx gold mine, the Columbus stainless steel project and the Alusaf
aluminium smelter.
He said various means of raising the finance were being examined. These
included scrip dividends, borrowings and sales of existing investments.
Gencor has announced that its R2bn rights offer, the largest in the
country's history, has been priced at a 14.5 per cent discount to the market
price. Shareholders are being offered 17 new shares for every 100 they hold,
at a price of R10 per share. The share price is currently around R11.70.
