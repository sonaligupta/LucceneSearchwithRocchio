FT  04 AUG 92 / Adverts anger Bolger


   By EMILIA TAGAZA

NEW ZEALAND'S prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, has responded angrily to
advertisements to be launched by the Australian Labor Party in the state of
Victoria.
The advertisements feature New Zealanders complaining about low wages,
inadequate social welfare and poor business prospects, blaming their
government's free market policies for the problems.
They warn that Victorians would feel similar pain if the opposition Liberal
Party won the election.
The Liberal Party is presenting a package of state and federal policies
similar to those in New Zealand, including a goods and services tax and a
deregulated labour market.
The adverts will launch the Victorian state election campaign in October. Mr
Bolger said the Victorian state government was desperate to find someone
else to blame.
