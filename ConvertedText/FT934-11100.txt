FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: US defence cuts mean 1,150 jobs
go at Raytheon


   By AP-DJ


RAYTHEON, the US electronics group, is to cut 1,150 jobs in Massachusetts,
as part of a plan to reduce costs to cope with shrinking US military
spending, reports AP-DJ.
The group said the job losses would follow a voluntary retirement programme
that has already trimmed the payroll by 800 jobs, 600 of them in
Massachusetts.
The combined cuts will bring the company's Massachusetts work force down to
21,050, compared with a peak of 31,100 in 1989.
Raytheon and other military contractors have been forced to retrench as the
federal government slashed the defence budget in the post-Cold War era.
Among the sites suffering cuts will be Raytheon's Andover plant, which makes
the Patriot missile that came to prominence in the Gulf War. It will lose
nearly 400 jobs.
Despite the falling defence budget, Raytheon has remained profitable, not
only by cutting costs, but also by focusing on other businesses such as
energy and environmental services.
