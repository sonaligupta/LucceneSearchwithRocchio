   SYDNEY


Mr Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, yesterday said the annual
growth rate could reach 4 per cent or more in the near-future, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
Consensus forecasts for Australia's growth are around 3.4 per cent this
year, rising to 3.6 per cent in 1995. An improvement in the forecasts would
reinforce an increasing cheerful view of the Australian economy.
