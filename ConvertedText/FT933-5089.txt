FT  06 SEP 93 / Debt rescheduling 'urgent' for Algeria


   By FRANCIS GHILES


MR Mourad Benhachenhou, a strong believer in the need to reschedule
Algeria's Dollars 26bn (Pounds 17bn) foreign debt, was appointed at the
weekend as finance minister in the Algerian government of Mr Redha Malek,
named prime minister two weeks ago.
Mr Benhachenhou was Finance Ministry secretary-general in the 1970s and
Algerian representative at the World Bank. After eight years there, he was
sacked in the spring of 1991 and conducted a vitiolic campaign in the
Algerian press against the team which, around Mr Mouloud Hamrouche, then
prime minister, had launched radical reforms in 1989-1991 aimed at freeing
the management of the country's economy.
The new minister recently wrote: 'Rescheduling becomes urgent, of little
cost if you compare it to the alternative of total economic collapse
threatening our country if the self-imposed policy of strangulation
continues.'
Talk of rescheduling the country's foreign debt has long been a taboo in
Algeria. Seeking an accommodation with the International Monetary Fund and
leading creditors such as France is the most urgent task confronting the new
government - annual repayment of principal and interest payments absorb
three quarters of Algeria oil and gas export income.
Mr Benhachenhou is one of two key appointees to the new government after the
sacking of Mr Belaid Abdessalam as prime minister. Colonel Selim Saadi, a
respected former military commander and agriculture minister, takes on the
interior portfolio. He is a close political friend of Mr Malek.
General Lamine Zeroual retains the defence portfolio. The new minister of
energy is the former deputy finance minister, Mr Ahmed Ben Bitour, while the
foreign portfolio goes to Mr Mohamed Salah Dembri, a diplomat and former
professor of French literature.
