FT  08 NOV 94 / Scottish Office told of staff cuts


   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent


Civil servants at the Scottish Office were told yesterday that jobs would be
cut at all levels in the next financial year as part of a programme to cut
annual staff costs by 6 per cent. Further reductions are likely in the
following two years.
The staff cuts follow the white paper on the civil service published in July
by Mr William Waldegrave, then the public service minister, with the aim of
'cutting the state down to size by demanding quality at a price the taxpayer
can afford'. Other government ministries are working to bring the white
paper's plans into effect.
The Scottish Office and its executive agencies, excluding the Scottish
Prison Service, employ 6,035 staff who will cost Pounds 130m this year. A 6
per cent cut would trim this by almost Pounds 8m. A further 4,500 work for
the Scottish Prison Service, which is carrying out its own staff review.
Sir Russell Hillhouse, permanent secretary at the Scottish Office, told
staff yesterday that jobs would be lost at all levels. It was too early to
say how many would go but he hoped the savings could be achieved by natural
wastage and voluntary early retirement.
