FT  06 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Company harmony can show way to peace
in N Ireland


   From Mr P R DOUGAN and OTHERS


Sir, Mackie International is located on the Belfast peace line.
All sections of the community enjoy employment in this company, a world
leader in the manufacture of textile machinery, in an atmosphere of
co-operation, free from discrimination and sectarian division. Mackie
International's employees have worked together throughout the most difficult
of years in Belfast's troubled history, yet with little disturbance to its
internal harmony.
Peace on Belfast's peace line does exist; it has been established within the
Mackie company community. All that is required is the extension of the peace
process beyond the company boundaries to the entire community. We have
proved it is possible.
Our hope for 1994 is that all our citizens will strive vigorously to achieve
both peace and, together, prosperity in west Belfast and beyond.
It is possible. It can be achieved.
