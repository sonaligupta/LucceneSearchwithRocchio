FT  12 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Where Israel is important to UK's
export efforts


   From Ms HELEN DAVIS


Sir, Peter Norman's excellent article on the progress of the Israeli economy
('Knocked about but unbowed,' April 5) failed to mention one important
dimension: the remarkable growth of Britain's trade relations with this
market.
Last year, Britain's visible exports exceeded Pounds 850m, an unprecedented
50 per cent increase over the previous year, making Israel Britain's
24th-largest export market. So far this year, growth in exports has
increased by a further 40 per cent and now averages Pounds 90m a month.
This growth has occurred almost exclusively in capital equipment and
manufactured goods, areas where Britain must focus its attention in order to
consolidate economic recovery. Israel's sales to Britain are also growing
and Britain is currently its second-largest customer after the US. This
year, bilateral trade could exceed Pounds 2bn.
Israel will import Dollars 20bn worth of goods this year and export Dollars
15bn, and Britain's share is a healthy 9.5 per cent of this market.
The effects of the Arab trade boycott continue to be felt in spite of the
peace process, yet it seems that British exporters are increasingly taking
advantage of this vital and innovative market.
