FT  22 APR 93 / Thuringia union officials, employers seek new pay talks to
avert strike


   By REUTER


   ERFURT


Employers and union officials in the east German state of Thuringia said
yesterday they wanted to meet for new pay talks in an attempt to avert a
strike over wage equalisation between east and west German workers, Reuter
reports from Erfurt.
A joint statement was released by local negotiators for IG Metall, Germany's
largest union, and local employers.
The two sides said they wanted to ask their national leaders if they would
be allowed to resume talks 'in spite of and regardless of the positions up
until now'. The dispute, originally over employers' refusal to pay a 26 per
cent pay rise from April 1, has developed into a row over how wage policy is
conducted. A strike ballot has been called for April 26-28.
A spokesman for the employers said the new talks were likely to take place
soon, but no date had been set.
