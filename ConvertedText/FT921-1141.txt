FT  25 MAR 92 / Letter: World Bank and Nigeria


   From Mr EDWIN R LIM


Sir, In the article, 'World Bank criticises Nigeria' (March 16), you quoted
without our authorisation from a confidential World Bank report on public
expenditure management in Nigeria. The article gives a misleading impression
of the purpose of the report, as well as its implications for Nigeria's
prospects for debt relief.
The report is part of an extensive policy dialogue between Nigeria and the
bank. It was based on a review of federal government public expenditure
carried out by the bank staff in collaboration with the main economic and
sectoral ministries in Nigeria in the early part of 1991. The main thrust of
the report was a number of recommendations on expenditure control and
management, project selection criteria, and other measures to strengthen the
budgetary process and improve the efficiency of public expenditures. It
might be noted that president Babangida, in his 1992 budget address,
specifically articulated concerns about the need for sound public
expenditure management.
We disagree with your article's speculation that the 'report may hit
prospects for debt rescheduling'. On the contrary, we consider a candid
review of public expenditure management to be a key step in Nigeria's
implementation of its structural adjustment programme and its efforts to
secure concessionary and longer term debt relief from creditors.
The World Bank has consistently supported, and continues to support, the
government's efforts to seek relief from its external debt burden, without
which the economic recovery and growth of this most populous country in
Africa would be difficult - a point which was made in your accompanying
article on Nigeria entitled 'An urgent need for debt relief'.
