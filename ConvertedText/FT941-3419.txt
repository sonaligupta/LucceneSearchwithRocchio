FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Shift in focus leaves Williams down at
Pounds 153m


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced improved
cashflow and a 13 per cent increase in profits before exceptional items to
Pounds 170.3m for the year to December 31.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 17.1m, to cover the loss on disposal of the
bulk of Williams' engineering division to management for Pounds 40m in
December, depressed pre-tax profits by Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 153.2m. The
sale is part of the group's strategy to focus on three sectors - building
products, security and fire protection.
Cashflow from operating activities, for which Williams has been criticised
in the past, improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 227.9m. This represented 119
per cent of operating profits.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chief executive, was bullish about the outlook for the
group's main operating markets, saying there were definite signs of recovery
in the UK and US. Some 80 per cent of the group's sales are from those two
markets. In the UK however, 'government policy and consumer caution will
limit the pace and degree of demand improvement,' he said.
Williams was seeking growth in spite of such difficulties, Mr Rudd said,
through expanding its share of even sluggish markets by tapping new outlets.
The group's sales were 17 per cent higher at Pounds 1.21bn, including a
Pounds 66.9m contribution from acquisitions. Continuing businesses were 11
per cent up at Pounds 1.1bn.
Williams pursued acquisitions aggressively during the year, spending Pounds
157.6m on seven businesses. These contributed Pounds 6.3m to operating
profits, which improved overall by 13 per cent to Pounds 191.6m.
North American building products showed the strongest advance, as a result
of a cost reductions. Operating profits rose 34 per cent to Pounds 39.6m.
Fire protection improved by 19 per cent to Pounds 47.6m, while the European
building products operations contributed Pounds 69.1m against Pounds 59.3m.
The security division improved from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 25.2m.
In line with its stated policy of seeking to improve the dividend cover to
about two times, Williams proposed a final payment of 7.75p. This leaves the
total dividend just 2 per cent higher at 12.75p. Earnings fell from 18.6p to
15.7p.
