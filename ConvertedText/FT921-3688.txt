FT  13 MAR 92 / DTI may release some companies from audit


   By ANDREW JACK


THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is considering removing the legal
requirement that smaller companies be subject to annual audit, in a radical
overhaul of company reporting.
An estimated 250,000 companies below the threshold for paying VAT - about
one quarter of all registered companies - could be freed from mandatory
annual external audits conducted by accountancy firms.
Mr John Redwood, minister for corporate affairs, said in an interview with
the Financial Times yesterday that consultation on the policy had started.
He said no firm decision had been made but he supported the idea of reducing
the coverage of audits and general thinking was moving in that direction.
He said it might remain a condition that smaller companies would be required
to retain the services of a professional accountant.
All limited companies have been required to have an audit since 1908. The
requirement was reaffirmed in the early 1980s after the introduction of the
fourth EC directive on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Audit fees charged by accountants to the smallest companies often run into
hundreds of pounds and the change in regulations could threaten income from
many smaller practitioners.
