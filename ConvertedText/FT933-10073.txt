FT  06 AUG 93 / LA police sentences may go to appeal

THE US JUSTICE Department is considering whether to appeal against the 2 1/2
 year jail sentences received by two white Los Angeles policemen convicted
on federal charges over the beating of Mr Rodney King, a black motorist.
The earlier acquittal on California state charges of all four police
officers involved in the incident led to rioting in Los Angeles last year
that left 54 dead and an estimated Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) in damage. The
severe beating of Mr King after a high-speed car chase in March 1991 was
videotaped by a bystander.
Prosecutors in the federal case had been seeking the maximum sentence - 10
years in jail and fines of up to Dollars 250,000. Explaining his leniency,
Judge John Davies said that Mr King had brought much of the violence upon
himself by resisting arrest.
The judge also criticised federal prosecutors for having put the officers
through a second trial after they had been acquitted in a state court.
There has been no violent reaction to the sentences handed down on
Wednedsay. However, they stirred anger and dismay in the Los Angeles black
community and a bitter response from Mr King. In a television interview
yesterday, he said that, if he had been facing similar charges, 'I would
have been doing 10, 15 years. But once you're going up against police
officers, it's hard to prove it. Who's going to believe you?'
'This is a travesty of justice, as opposed to a measure of justice,' said Mr
Joseph Duff, president of the LA chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. Mr Mark Whitlock, executive director of LA
Renaissance, a black community support group, charged that the sentences
would further erode faith in the fairness of the courts.
