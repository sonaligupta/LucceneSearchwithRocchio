FT  15 APR 94 / Pollution liability threatens pits sale


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


At least 200km of rivers in England and Wales are polluted by leaks from
abandoned coal mines, the National Rivers Authority, the water quality
watchdog, said yesterday.
Uncertainty over liability for this pollution needs to be settled before the
privatisation of British Coal takes place, said Lord Crickhowell, the
watchdog's chairman.
British Coal now operates just 17 pits. In the past year it has stopped
mining at more than 30 pits, but is still pumping water at some to prevent
them leaking into rivers and water tables.
The watchdog is concerned that the proposed Coal Authority will not take
responsibility for the pollution. But bidders for the 16 deep mines and 31
opencast mines put up for sale by the government may be concerned that they
may have to pay for pollution control.
