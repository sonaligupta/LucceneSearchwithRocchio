FT  06 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar volatile on US jobs data


   By PETER JOHN


THE dollar rose yesterday after a higher than expected gain in the latest
employment figures from the US. But its advance was slowed towards the end
of European trading by late profit-taking, writes Peter John.
The figure for non-farm payrolls increased by 177,000 in October while most
economists had anticipated a rise of about 150,000. Also, the September
figure of 156,000 was revised upwards to 162,000.
Initially, the US currency slipped slightly as investors who had banked on a
strong figure took their profits. Then a wave of buying pushed it to a high
of DM1.7078 against the D-Mark and Y108.48 against the Japanese yen.
Several economists argued that the data represented a fundamental economic
shift that would be underscored by buoyant retail sales figures next Friday
and a gain in industrial production figures the following week.
Mr Brian Fabbri, US economist for Midland Global Markets, said the pick up
in jobs signalled a move 'from slow to moderate growth'.
Mr Paul Chertkow of UBS said: 'The economic data is supportive of the dollar
and undermining the D-Mark.' He added that while more improved figures were
expected from the US, German retail sales figures next week could well
underline the continuing need for Germany to cut interest rates further.
By the end of the day's trading in Europe the dollar had fallen back to
DM1.6915, down from DM1.6960 previously. However, it has risen eight cents
against the D-Mark over the past month and there was confidence that it
would push towards DM1.7250 - seen as the next resistance point - in the
next few weeks.
There is also a belief that it will strengthen against the yen. Mr Chertkow
believes that the problems within the Japanese economy will prompt the US
currency to rise to Y110 within the next month and Y115 by the end of the
year.
However, it closed slightly lower yesterday at Y108.15, down from Y108.30
previously.
Meanwhile, the D-Mark was generally weaker against other European
currencies. Against the French franc it fell below FFr3.48 for the first
time since September to close at FFr3.4750 from FFr3.4840.
In the absence of new economic data, sterling maintained its strength
against the D-Mark to close half a pfennig higher at DM2.5150 and recovered
some lost ground against the dollar to end the day at Dollars 1.4865, up
from Dollars 1.4795 previously.
Expectations of further UK interest rate cuts have dimmed and some
economists now feel that there is no more than half a point to come off the
current 6 per cent base rates.
