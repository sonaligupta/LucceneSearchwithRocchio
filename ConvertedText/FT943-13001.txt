FT  21 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Good news for product safety in
Europe


   From Mr STEPHEN CRAMPTON


Sir, Stephen Sidkin and Nigel Miller ('Stay secure on safety', July 19)
appear to take a dim view of the quality of British manufacturing industry.
They apparently regard requirements to supply safe goods, to warn purchasers
about any particular risks, to investigate complaints and to recall
dangerous products as 'costly and onerous'. It is not one that we share.
It is true that the European General Product Safety Directive provides (to
us, welcome) additional protection for consumers, although the UK is
unlikely to take up all the powers which the directive sets out. But it is
also good news for reputable UK manufacturers, because their European
competitors will now be subject to similar obligations to those set out in
the UK's 1987 Consumer Protection Act. Dangerous products cross frontiers
and this legislation is a boost for consumers for fair competition and for
the single market.
