FT  08 NOV 93 / Hosokawa seeks reform meeting


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


JAPAN'S prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, wants to settle a debate over
political reform by calling a meeting this week with Mr Yohei Kono, the
leader of the opposition Liberal Democratic party.
Several weeks of inconclusive negotiations between government and opposition
have led Mr Hosokawa to fear that political reform is in serious danger of
derailment, and he wants outstanding issues to be settled this week.
Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if reforms are not introduced this
year, and there were signs at the weekend that he is frustrated by lack of
progress. He said the policy differences 'are not great' and a meeting with
Mr Kono could end most of them.
Under the proposed reforms, the present multi-seat constituency system will
be replaced by a blend of single seats and proportional representation.
However, the government and opposition disagree on the ratio of seats to be
decided by the two methods.
The multi-seat constituency system is blamed for encouraging corruption
during the 38-year rule of the LDP, whose factions competed against each
other in the same constituency to raise campaign funds and establish
networks of influence.
However, the reform proposals are opposed by many members of the Social
Democratic party, the largest group in Mr Hosokawa's coalition, as they fear
that the party will be the biggest loser under the new system and that the
LDP will benefit from the changes.
The LDP is also divided over the proposals, as older members of the party
are concerned that they will lose influence and, perhaps, their seats in the
new system. In public, these members offer vague support for reform, but, in
private, they are behind the stalling that has prompted Mr Hosokawa to call
for a meeting with Mr Kono.
