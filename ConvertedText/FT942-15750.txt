FT  14 APR 94 / Cuban power cuts top 10 hours a day


   By REUTER


   HAVANA


Cuba's authorities have blamed lack of spare parts from former communist
bloc-built power plants for unusually long power cuts - sometimes exceeding
10 hours a day - in the capital, Reuter reports from Havana.
The power failures are an added strain on Cubans already battling severe
shortages of transport, many food items and basic consumer goods such as
soap and toothpaste.
The state news agency AIN quoted on Tuesday electricity board officials as
saying the problem lay with Soviet and Czech-built plants which accounted
for more than half the country's 3,132MW generating capacity.
Spare parts had not been received for these plants since 1990 and Cuba's
ability to keep up maintenance with the parts it had lasted only until May
last year, AIN said.
About 821MW-worth of generating capacity was affected by breakdowns, 570MW
by maintenance work and 372MW by general limitations on generating capacity,
the agency added.
However, new spare parts were being bought, which would enable the country
to carry out a maintenance programme and recuperate generating capacity.
The AIN report did not mention lack of fuel for Cuba's oil-powered
electricity plants as a reason for the difficulties.
Cuba has been facing a severe economic crisis, including chronic fuel
shortages, since the collapse of the communist bloc and its traditional aid
and trade links. It has grown used to regular power failures in the last few
years.
In recent months the power cuts in Havana were scheduled to last about four
to six hours a day.
But this rose to eight to 10 hours a day in the last two weeks, with cuts
sometimes running beyond schedule. In parts of Havana earlier this week
there was no power for 12 hours.
Last August there was an outbreak of vandalism in Havana apparently linked
to frustration over unusually long power cuts.
