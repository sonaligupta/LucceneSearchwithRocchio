FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: GAN slips as claims mount

GROUPE des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the third largest French
state-controlled insurer, has announced a 4 per cent net profits fall, a
slightly smaller drop than forecast.
Net earnings fell to FFr2.4bn (Dollars 416m) last year, from FFr2.5bn in
1989, a decline which GAN attributed to high disaster claims from storms at
the start of the year, plus a lower contribution to net profits from Groupe
CIC, its banking division.
Despite having to pay out FFr431m for storm damage claims, net profits from
GAN's insurance activities rose from FFr1.8bn to FFr1.9bn.
Premium income climbed by 22 per cent to FFr33.5bn from FFr27.5bn, led by
the life insurance business, which achieved strong growth.
