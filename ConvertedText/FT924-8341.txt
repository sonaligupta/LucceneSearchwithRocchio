FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Speculation over Ford management
shake-up

   NEW YORK


WILL Ford Motor, the second largest of Detroit's big three vehicle
manufacturers, follow rivals General Motors and Chrysler and remake its top
management team before the year is out? If so, might a British-born
executive emerge as heir-apparent to the chairman?
That is one of the hottest topics of debate in the US motor industry, with
some analysts suggesting Ford could move as early as this week to anoint an
heir-apparent to Mr Harold Poling, the company's 67-year-old chairman and
chief executive, who is due to retire next year.
The favoured candidate of the Detroit rumour-mill is Mr Alex Trotman, 59,
the British-born executive vice-president in charge of Ford's North American
operations.
Mr Trotman, who joined Ford in Britain in 1955 as a student trainee, rose on
the product planning side. He is the only member of the group's senior
executive team to have run its vehicle operations in the three major markets
 -North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific. Until just a few months ago, the
front-runner had been widely assumed to be Mr Allan Gilmour, 58, the urbane
executive vice-president in charge of worldwide vehicle operations.
However, some analysts claim to have detected growing enthusiasm on the Ford
board for Mr Trotman, who reports to Mr Gilmour. Mr Trotman's background is
in vehicle manufacturing, while Mr Gilmour reached the top through Ford's
finance operations.
The financial and engineering sides of the industry have often vied for the
top jobs - hence the phrase 'bean counters versus car guys'.
Ford's board is due to hold two meetings before the end of the year - the
first is on Thursday - and analysts suggest it may decide to set a
succession in motion, to ensure a smooth transition. A spokesman refused to
comment.
