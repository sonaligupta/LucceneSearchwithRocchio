FT  13 NOV 92 / People: Aiming to 'gain traction' at P-E


A slimmer, more efficient main board is George Cox's aim at P-E
International, and the principal reason behind a management reshuffle which
gives new responsibilities to Peter Smith, appointed managing director of
the group's management consulting business, and to Michael Wale, who will
combine the roles of company secretary and finance director.
Cox took over as executive chairman of the UK-based consulting group last
May and has been seeking ways of sharp-ening P-E's competitive edge. At the
interim stage the group reported profits of only Pounds 514,000 on fees of
Pounds 35.5m. The board changes, he says, are a way of combating a tendency
to 'expend too much energy running the engine rather than gaining traction'.
Smith (left), aged 45, was chairman and chief executive of the management
consultancy Handley-Walker, acquired by P-E in 1991. He takes over from
David Blore who will take up a new appointment within the group, focusing on
major consulting projects and key clients.
Wale, 56, replaces John Platt who is leaving the group. Cox says his
intention is to reduce the number of non-executive directors from four to
three, leaving a seven-strong main board. He says trading conditions remain
tough and that performance over the next six months is hard to predict;
order intake, however, has been strong.
