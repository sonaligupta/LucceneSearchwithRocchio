FT  19 MAY 92 / People: Stock Exchange loses Hogarth


Peter Hogarth, managing director of the trading markets division of the
London Stock Exchange, is resigning at the end of the month, thus furnishing
further evidence of disarray at the top of the exchange.
Peter Rawlins, chief executive, hired Hogarth, then chief executive of
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, last March. Hogarth had previously spent
21 years with accountants Peat Marwick.
The exchange maintains that 41-year-old Hogarth is departing not much
earlier than planned, having completed his remit in the areas of broad
markets strategy, and information and technical services. In truth, the
exchange's customers have certainly yet to see the fruits of much of this
work.
And just last month Rawlins, an ex-Arthur Andersen man, contracted out the
information technology operations to Andersen Consulting for the next five
years, effectively sidelining Hogarth. Meanwhile, staff turnover at the
exchange has been high, including in Hogarth's division.
Hogarth is not being replaced directly - completing the collapse of the
management structure set up by Rawlins whereby the exchange was carved up
into three separate businesses, each with its own managing director and
board. Christine Dann, who has been running the primary markets division
since the beginning of last year, also assumes responsibility for
information services.
