FT  29 APR 94 / Mortgage lenders criticised by MMC


   By ALISON SMITH


Mortgage lenders yesterday came under pressure to spell out more clearly the
valuation and administration fees they charge borrowers.
A report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on residential mortgage
valuations said that the failure of some lenders to tell borrowers about the
administration fees that might be charged with valuation fees was distorting
competition.
It recommended that where lenders referred to valuation fees, they should be
required to specify separately any related administration charges.
However, the inquiry found that though there was a complex monopoly in
favour of a number of mortgage lenders, in most areas their practices did
not act against the public interest.
Among the lenders highlighted as not making clear the position on valuation
fees were the Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance & Leicester building
societies. All three said yesterday that they were re-examining their
practices.
The MMC inquiry began two years ago after complaints that lenders refused to
take valuations from independent surveyors and used only small lists of
approved valuers.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said he had asked Sir Bryan
Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, to consult the Council of
Mortgage Lenders about issuing advice to its members.
Mr Hamilton urged careful consideration of the MMC's recommendations that
lenders should be ready to consider a valuation with a more extensive
structural survey by a surveyor nominated by the borrower, and that those
accepting only certain valuers should make this clear at the start.
The report was attacked by the Consumers' Association for failing to address
the need to give the borrower a genuine choice of surveyor.
