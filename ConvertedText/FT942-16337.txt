FT  11 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Tesco - Other companies


The UK's second largest supermarket group is expected to announce tomorrow a
fall in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 581m to Pounds 520m-Pounds 530m,
after new depreciation policies but before one-off charges.
The figures for the year to February will reflect the impact of the group's
decision - announced in January - to start depreciating stores, which will
take Pounds 36m off reported profits, and land premiums, removing another
Pounds 32m. There will also be a one-off write-down of Pounds 85m on land
values.
On a headline basis - after all charges - the pre-tax figure is estimated at
Pounds 435m-Pounds 445m. On the old basis analysts believe profits would
have increased to Pounds 590m-Pounds 600m.
