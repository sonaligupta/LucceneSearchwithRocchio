FT  16 DEC 94 / MoD is urged to sell much of its land


The Ministry of Defence should sell large areas of its land, the Commons
defence committee said yesterday.
The MoD owns 561,000 acres of land across Britain and leases a further
39,500 acres. This total is 1 per cent of the area of the UK.
The committee said sites known to be surplus to requirements should be
disposed of. Some sites could be reduced in size and some freehold land
could be sold and leased back.
The committee recommended that the MoD should explore the possibility of
setting up an agency to hold and dispose of surplus land.
The committee's report said: 'We are confident that it should be reduced in
scale, driven not by targets for one-off capital gain, but by military
requirements and assessments of particular sites.'
It added: 'There is scope for greater use of training rights over private
land, including agricultural set-aside land, and of other MoD land, such as
test and evaluation facilities.'
But the committee saw no prospect of military training in the national parks
ending, unless the land concerned was taken out of the parks.
