FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Chrysalis and Japanese group in Dollars
17.5m deal


   By CATHERINE MILTON


SHARES IN Chrysalis Group rose by 37p to 116p after Fujisankei, the Japanese
media company, agreed to buy more than a quarter of the UK media company's
new record division for Dollars 17.5m (Pounds 11.5m), valuing the Echo Label
at more than the market value of the whole group.
Pony Canyon, Fujisankei's music division, will pay three installments over
two years for a 25.1 per cent stake. Echo, formally launched in July, was
planned following the lapse of a 12-month no-competition clause attached to
Chrysalis' sale of its old record label to Thorn EMI.
Mr Chris Wright, chairman, said: 'We've now got a very strong partner who is
in the business and prepared to spend the necessary resources.'
Echo has not yet signed any artistes and Chrysalis said yesterday the money
raised from the equity sale would fund the label during its initial
development phase.
Chrysalis will subscribe for the remaining shares and the two shareholders
will each make available an interest-bearing loan facility of Dollars 2.5m
to fund the development of interactive music product.
Chrysalis' shares in Echo will be held by an intermediate holding company,
Armourvale, which will be 75 per cent owned by Chrysalis and 25 per cent
owned by Mr Steve Lewis, the managing director and chief executive of
Chrysalis' music division.
