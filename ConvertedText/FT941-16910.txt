FT  07 JAN 94 / Capital spending 'cut 20%' by Tories


   By JAMES BLITZ


Labour yesterday accused the government of cutting expenditure on local
authority capital projects by more than 20 per cent over the past decade,
creating maintenance problems for roads, school buildings and housing
estates, James Blitz writes.
Mr Doug Henderson, a shadow environment minister, said in a fresh assault on
the Conservatives' local government policies that the rise in capital
spending by local authorities in the past 10 years had been 21.8 per cent
below the rate of inflation.
Using parliamentary written answers, he also said that the worst victim of
the cuts had been housing, where spending had been cut by about 81 per cent
in real terms. 'This has created a capital deficit in our country which has
led to crumbling classrooms, leaking school roofs and dangerous roads,' he
said. 'The government seems blind to the effect of these policies.'
In spite of yesterday's attack, Labour's economic policies looked set to
come under fire from Mr Bryan Gould, the party's former campaign organiser
who stepped down from the shadow cabinet after the last election.
According to Tribune, the Labour weekly, Mr Gould will attack Labour's
economic policies in a manifesto to be published next month. In the
document, Mr Gould will accuse Mr John Smith, the party leader, of paying
'lip-service' to full employment.
