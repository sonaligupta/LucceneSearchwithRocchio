FT  22 OCT 92 / Aspinall loses in casino battle


   By BETHAN HUTTON


MR John Aspinall, the casino and zoo operator, was ordered to pay Pounds
160,000 costs yesterday after failing to block a casino licence application
by London Clubs International.
A licensing committee at Thames Magistrates Court granted a gaming licence
for London Clubs' Golden Nugget casino, in Soho, in spite of Mr Aspinall's
objection.
Licences for four other casinos, including the Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs,
are likely to be granted on Friday.
The future of London Clubs' six casinos, which account for about 40 per cent
of London's gaming business, has been in doubt since four casinos were
raided by police and Gaming Board officials in June 1991.
This forced the abandonment of the company's stock market flotation,
scheduled for a few days later.
The Gaming Board applied for the cancellation of all six clubs' licences,
alleging serious breaches of gaming laws.
However, after the resignation this year of the chairman, several directors
and senior managers of London Clubs, and the restructuring of the company
and its shareholders, the Gaming Board issued certificates of consent for
six new gaming licences.
Mr John Mathew QC, representing Mr Aspinall's company, Aspinall Clubs, said
the company's past history was relevant to the granting of licences to the
new management. Mr George Carman QC, representing London Clubs, said Mr
Aspinall's objection had been 'irresponsible in the extreme', as no evidence
of the current management's unfitness had been produced.
He said the public might feel that Mr Aspinall's objections were motivated
by his own involvement in the casino business. Mr Aspinall has not yet
decided whether to object to a sixth casino's licence application, which is
due to be heard by a different licensing committee this month.
