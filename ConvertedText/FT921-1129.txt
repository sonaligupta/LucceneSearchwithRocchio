FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Buffett breaks silence on Pounds 153m
Guinness stake


   By MARTIN MULLIGAN


THE AMERICAN investor Warren Buffett confirms in his eagerly awaited annual
report to shareholders that his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
has purchased a stake of more than 31.2m shares in Guinness for Dollars
264.8m (Pounds 153m).
The purchase represents the first time that the investment conglomerate has
made a significant investment in a company domiciled outside the US. In the
report, Buffett writes: 'Guinness  .. earns its money in much the same
fashion as Coca-Cola and Gillette, US-based companies that garner most of
their profits from international operations.'
Berkshire owns about 7 per cent of the capital stock of Coca-Cola Co. and
about 11 per cent of Gillette. Chief financial officer J. Verne McKenzie
said the company would not elaborate on the Guinness purchase beyond Mr
Buffett's remarks.
