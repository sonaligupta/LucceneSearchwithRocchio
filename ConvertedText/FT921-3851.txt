FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Repap plans to raise CDollars
150m through share deal

REPAP Enterprises, one of North America's biggest lightweight coated paper
producers, plans to raise CDollars 150m through an issue of subordinate
voting shares, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The issue will bolster Repap's cash position. The shares will be offered by
Gordon Capital and Credit Suisse First Boston in Canada and Europe. The
issue is not registered in the US.
Repap has nearly 100m tons of coated paper capacity in New Brunswick and
Wisconsin, and is a large market pulp producer in western Canada.
Because of poor markets, it reported heavy losses last year and is not
expected to return to normal profitability, with the rest of the industry,
until 1993.
The Japan Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), the nation's
leading business group, has urged Japan to allow listed companies to acquire
their own shares, Keidanren said in a statement, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Currently, a listed company cannot buy its own shares, a legacy of the
post-war era aimed at preventing big conglomerates.
Jardine Fleming, the UK brokerage house, has issued 60m two-year covered
warrants on shares of Cathay Pacific Airways at HKDollars 3.10 each, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
The warrants carry a strike price of HKDollars 12.60. The premium, based on
the closing share price of HKDollars 12.70, is 24.6 per cent and the gearing
is 4.07 times.
The oversubscribed issue was fully placed with institutional and retail
investors in Hong Kong, Europe, Britain and the US. The expiry date is March
11 1994.
