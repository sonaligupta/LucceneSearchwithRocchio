FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Charter Consolidated declines 4.8% but
increases dividend


   By MAGGIE URRY


CHARTER Consolidated, the industrial holding group with a 38.5 per cent
stake in Johnson Matthey, the metals business, reported a 4.8 per cent fall
to Pounds 73.8m in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
The previous year's figures were after a Pounds 2.4m exceptional charge.
The strong balance sheet and relatively small fall in profits encouraged the
board to propose a final dividend of 14.5p to give a total of 21.5p (21p).
The dividend is almost twice covered by earnings per share of 42.5p (44.6p).
Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive, said the group had done well in
difficult trading conditions.
The shares rose initially yesterday but fell later, to close 2p down at
538p.
Mr Herbert said three of the four businesses managed within the group
increased trading profits, with JM's contribution virtually flat at Pounds
25.5m (Pounds 25.6m).
Group turnover was 1.3 per cent lower at Pounds 1.1bn, and operating profits
were down 2.5 per cent to Pounds 59.2m. Interest on the group's cash
balances fell, contributing Pounds 14.6m against Pounds 19.2m.
Mr Nigel Robson, finance director, said every one point fall in interest
rates cut group profits by Pounds 2m. Net cash fell from Pounds 133m to
Pounds 121.7m over the year although Pounds 30m was spent on acquisitions
and Pounds 25m on capital expenditure.
Mr Herbert said that in a 'challenging year' cost-cutting and a push to
increase overseas business had helped contain the profit fall.
At the Anderson mining equipment subsidiary 550 jobs had gone in the year,
cutting the workforce to 1,100 compared with 2,200 two years ago. Of the
Pounds 27m provision set up at Anderson a year earlier, Pounds 15m remained.
Pandrol, the rail track equipment business, lifted operating profits by 9.3
per cent to Pounds 11.8m, while the mining equipment division increased
profits from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 2.8m. Quarrying and mining profits rose
from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 3m, but building products profits were down from
Pounds 17m to Pounds 12.5m.
COMMENT
There are two ways of looking at Charter. It can be seen as a vehicle of
Minorco, which holds 36 per cent of the shares. That view could be supported
by the slightly surprising, though welcome, increase in the dividend, and
Charter's seeming inability to deal with the JM stake. On the other hand,
Charter could be a victim of circumstance, manfully running its
majority-owned businesses and trying to invest its substantial cash balances
sensibly. The truth probably falls somewhere between the two. On forecast
profits of Pounds 75m the prospective p/e is 12.3. Looking at it another
way, subtracting the value of the JM stake and the cash makes the rest of
the business look distinctly cheap. But more action is needed before that is
likely to change.
