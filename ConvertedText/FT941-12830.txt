FT  28 JAN 94 / Third wind farm turned down


The renewable energy industry has suffered its third setback in south Wales
in a fortnight with a planning committee's rejection of a 45-turbine wind
farm.
Port Talbot councillors voted to reject the application by TriGen Windpower
for a 20MW wind farm on a forested hillside 500 metres up. They decided its
appearance would be detrimental to the area.
The decision, after the rejection by councils of two other wind farms in
Dyfed earlier this month, reflects increasing public opposition.
