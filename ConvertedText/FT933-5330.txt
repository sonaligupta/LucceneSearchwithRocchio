FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: US retailers report mixed sales


   By KAREN ZAGOR


LARGE US retailers yesterday reported a wide range of sales results for
August, indicating only a sporadic recovery in the sector.
Chicago-based department store group Sears, Roebuck continued to lead the
pack with a 10.9 per cent gain in domestic same-store sales last month. Mr
Arthur Martinez, the merchandise group's chairman, said there were gains in
almost all merchandising lines with strong results in appliances and
apparel.
Kmart, the discount store and speciality retailer, saw a 3.4 per cent
improvement in comparable store sales. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said
the company had 'a broadening of the strength seen in June and July when the
improvement was more concentrated in basic consumable items and seasonal
merchandise lines'.
Wal-Mart Stores, top-selling US retailer, said same-store sales rose 4 per
cent in August, compared with 9 per cent in July. Same-store sales for the
company's Sam's Clubs fell 7 per cent in the month. The company blamed
'cannibalisation in many of the Sam's markets, coupled with disinflation in
key merchandise categories'.
Woolworth posted a 2.6 per cent drop in domestic comparable store sales in
August, compared with a 3.3 per cent fall in July.
Federated Department Stores, which includes the Bloomingdale's and Bon
Marche chains, saw comparable store sales advance 2.1 per cent for the
month, compared with July's 0.2 per cent decline.
