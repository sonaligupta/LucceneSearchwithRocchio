FT  13 MAR 93 / JCB wins right to build factory


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


THE government is to allow JC Bamford Excavators, one of the UK's largest
privately owned groups, to build a plant in the green belt near Cheadle,
Staffordshire.
The decision, announced yesterday by the Department of Environment,
overrides the recommendation of Mrs Mary McClune, the planning inspector who
last September held a public inquiry and concluded that JCB's application
should be rejected.
The government has thus breached its normal planning restrictions on
developments in the green belt. Planning policy hitherto has discouraged
green belt developments in favour of encouraging the redevelopment of
inner-city areas. This policy was emphasised, especially in the home
counties, by Conservative politicians before the last general election.
The planned JCB plant, covering 15,220 square metres, would house JCB
Special Products, making skid steer loaders and small back low loaders
presently manufactured at Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.
In a letter to Kent Jones and Done, JCB's solicitors in Stoke-on-Trent, the
environment department noted that the development was 'inappropriate' but
said that 'in this most exceptional of cases' economic benefits outweighed
such harm as might be caused to the green belt.
JCB's application was supported by Staffordshire County Council.
