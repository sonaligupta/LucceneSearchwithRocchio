FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Sale and lease-back deal on 34 P&O ships


   By MAGGIE URRY


PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&O) has arranged a leasing deal
on 34 ships with a market value of Pounds 400m, from its fleet of 128
vessels.
The deal will not affect the total of P&O's loans, but it extends the
maturity of the finance for the ships, and secures the finance on them. It
will mean some savings on the interest bill, although these are not expected
to be sizeable, and the use of leases is also tax effective.
P&O's shares jumped 31p to 629p initially, but fell back to show a gain of
5p to 603p when the market realised that group borrowings would not be
reduced. Analysts said the deal was modestly helpful to earnings and might
make a rights issue less likely.
The stock market had expected a rights issue from P&O when it announced
annual results last month, because its gearing is regarded as high. The
company said then that it had not considered an issue.
The ships have been sold to a consortium which has leased them back to P&O.
One of the providers of finance is Abbey National, the former building
society turned bank. Ship leasing is a new area for its treasury department.
The deal, arranged by Hambros Bank, the merchant bank which has a reputation
for ship financing, will replace ordinary loan finance for the ships. The
leases will cover the working life of the ships, which P&O will still
control, and the change in finance will have no effect on the way the ships
are operated.
P&O's fleet had a book value in its December 31 balance sheet of Pounds
1.03bn. The group's 128 ships include container and bulk cargo ships,
ferries and cruise liners. Of the total, 87 ships were wholly owned by the
group with the rest partly owned or leased. The 34 were taken from the 87
wholly-owned ships and include all types of P&O's ships.
P&O's balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 1.4bn, just over 80 per cent
of shareholders' funds of Pounds 1.74bn. Its interest bill in 1990 was
Pounds 122.4m, up from Pounds 74.6m in 1989, a rise which contributed to the
fall in P&O's pre-tax profits to Pounds 261.3m (376.7m).
P&O is not planning any similar deals on its other ships at present.
