FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Kmart considers sale of PayLess
Northwest unit


   By NIKKI TAIT


KMART, the Michigan-based retailer, said yesterday it was considering the
sale of its PayLess Drug Stores Northwest subsidiary.
PayLess comprises 560 drug store outlets in a dozen states, mainly in the
west of the US. Its sales last year reached Dollars 2.3bn, and operating
profits stood at Dollars 113m.
Kmart gave no indication of how far any potential sale process had gone, and
its chairman, Mr Joseph Antonini, said that he could not predict the outcome
'at this time'.
The retailer has been struggling in the face of an increasing difficult
market for the discount store operators, and its Pace warehouse club chain
has faced significant problems.
In June, Kmart warned that after-tax profits for the current year would be
unlikely to match 1992's Dollars 941m, and its shares have been bumping
around their 52-week lows in recent weeks.
This summer, Kmart indicated it might spin off or sell some of its
specialist retail interests - although yesterday's announcement is the first
time that the group has specifically named a division which might be up for
sale.
Kmart is best-known for its mainline discount stores, but also incorporates
specialised retail businesses. Aside from PayLess and the Pace club outlets,
Kmart takes in Builders Square, Waldenbooks, The Sports Authority, OfficeMax
and Borders - selling goods ranging from books to sportswear.
