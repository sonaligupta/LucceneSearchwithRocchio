FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cityvision rebel holders expect 10% support


   By NORMA COHEN


TWO FORMER executives of Cityvision expect to have the backing of 'well
over' 10 per cent of shareholder votes in an unusual call to oust the
company's current management following its agreement to be acquired by
US-based Blockbuster Entertainment.
Cityvision, the UK's largest video rental chain which markets itself under
the Ritz name, was the subject of an agreed Pounds 75m cash and shares offer
from Blockbuster last November. Cityvision shares, which had been
languishing at 25p, rose sharply when the deal was announced and are now
trading at 50p, the value of the offer.
However, some shareholders had been unhappy with the offer, saying that
despite the price premium, Cityvision's franchise operation, by far the
largest in the UK, is worth more than that.
Yesterday, in a circular to shareholders, Mr Philip Crane, a video
entrepreneur who sold out to Blockbuster, and Mr Ray Hipkin, founder of the
Ritz video chain, urged shareholders to reject Blockbuster's offer which
closes on January 22.
Instead, shareholders will be notified of an extraordinary general meeting
at which they will be asked to name Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane to replace the
current management.
In the circular, Mr Hipkin and Mr Crane charged that the company's current
directors had failed to capitalise on the Ritz brand name and had failed to
use innovative marketing techniques to gain market share.
