FT  06 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Valutation Office Agency


HOUSEHOLDERS who intend to appeal against the original valuation of their
property for the council tax are reminded that the last date for this is
November 30. Letters should be sent to the listing officer at the local
office of the Valuation Office Agency. Complaints about discounts and
personal liability are not affected. These should be addressed to the local
council, and an appeal can be made to a valuation tribunal if the outcome is
not favourable.
