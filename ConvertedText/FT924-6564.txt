SONY, the leading Japanese consumer electronics group, yesterday confirmed
the sharp downturn in domestic consumer demand with a 61 per cent fall in
interim taxable profits.
And Pioneer Electronic, the audio equipment maker, announced poor interim
earnings, posting a 44 per cent drop in pre-tax profits.
Sony's consolidated taxable profits for the first half to September plunged
to Y38bn (Dollars 309m) from the previous year's Y97.5bn. The announcements
follow other leading Japanese electronics companies, which have also
reported sharp profit falls due to sluggish trading. Matsushita, the largest
group in the industry, reported a 65.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
earlier this week.
Sony's sales were boosted by a rise in entertainment revenue, and advanced
4.8 per cent to Y1,900.1bn. Operating profits however fell 39.6 per cent to
Y64bn due to foreign exchange losses, and net profits fell 60.2 per cent to
Y17.9bn.
Entertainment revenue rose 17.9 per cent to Y383.6bn, thanks to the group's
box office hits. Revenues from films and videos rose 40.4 per cent, due to
its film Hook, which brought in Dollars 250m, while A League of Their Own,
starring Madonna, netted Dollars 104m.
Electronics equipment sales increased 2 per cent to Y1,516.5bn. Video
equipment sales were hurt by market saturation, falling 3.8 per cent to
Y437.3bn, while audio equipment was flat at Y452.4bn.
Domestic sales fell 2.9 per cent to Y461bn, while overseas sales rose 7.6
per cent to Y1,439bn, supported by to a 12.5 per cent rise in the US.
European sales advanced 4.8 per cent, because of the strong D-Mark.
Inventories, of which 85 per cent is electronics equipment, fell 2 per cent
to Y851.6bn. Sony said it wanted to reduce the level to Y800bn by the end of
the fiscal year to March through a cut in production.
First-half capital spending was curbed by 41 per cent to Y137.6bn, while
research and development spending rose 2 per cent to Y117.8bn.
On a non-consolidated basis, Sony saw a 0.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
to Y36.6bn on a 3.7 per cent decline in sales to Y959.2bn. The company,
which fell into the red on the operating level last fiscal year, managed to
post a profit of Y11.7bn due to aggressive cost cutting.
Uncertainty over a recovery in the domestic market forced Sony to revise
down previous forecasts for the 12 months to March. Consolidated sales are
expected to rise 3 per cent to Y3,950bn, while operating profits are
projected to fall 20 per cent to Y133bn. The group's net income is forecast
to fall 71 per cent to Y35bn.
Meanwhile, Pioneer said pre-tax profits fell to Y10.8bn due to poor sales of
audio-visual equipment and karaoke systems. Sales fell 2.7 per cent to
Y205.5bn, with domestic sales declining 12.8 per cent. After-tax profits
tumbled 37.9 per cent to Y6.6bn. Pioneer expects annual pre-tax profits to
fall 34.1 per cent to Y21.8bn on a 2.5 per cent drop in sales to Y405.5bn.
