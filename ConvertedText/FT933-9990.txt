FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


For a long time the dud night of the week on television was Saturday. Even
now you could scarcely call the Saturday schedule compelling, but at least
it is not as bad as Friday's. Tonight BBC1 screens repeats of Dad's Army,
Casualty, and Critters. ITV shows an absurd American drama series called Dr
Quinn: Medicine Woman which smears 1960s feminism like an impenetrable layer
of margarine over stories of the Wild West in the 1860s; and another drama
series called Stay Lucky which 'stars' Dennis Waterman who seems to have
picked up all his acting skills at Ealing Studios before he was out of short
trousers.
BBC2 shows the second in its series Architecture Of The Imagination. If you
thought that Programme 1 provided remarkable insights into the significance
and symbolism of the door, then doubtless you will want to watch today's
episode about the staircase.
Channel 4 continues with its worthy but saddening 'Bloody Bosnia' season and
begins another series of the unimpressive American comedy Nurses.
