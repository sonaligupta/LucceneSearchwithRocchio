FT  28 MAR 92 / Brazil seeks quotas for exports of coffee


   By BILL HINCHBERGER


   SAO PAULO


BRAZIL, the world's leading coffee producer, hopes to achieve an
international accord using export quotas to spread the responsibility for
maintaining prices, according to private sector sources.
The government announced a 10-point set of principles to guide its position
in talks on the International Coffee Agreement in London early next month.
Brazil favours a quota system covering all coffee exports, thus avoiding
two-tier markets. One of the main reasons for the collapse of the last
agreement in July 1989 was the sale of coffee outside the agreement at lower
prices.
It wants 'realistic' prices without stimulating 'excessive growth in
production', and argues that each country's quota should reflect its 'real
capacity' to supply the market, considering stocks as well as production and
export capacity.
The Brazilian government also argues against 'distorted commercial policies'
 -which observers understand as criticism of official subsidies in countries
such as Colombia.
