FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: Nedlloyd net surges to Fl 43m
for quarter

   AMSTERDAM


Nedlloyd, the Dutch transport group, posted a net profit of Fl 43m (Dollars
25m) in the third quarter, up sharply from a F l7m loss a year earlier, when
results were burdened by extraordinary charges of Fl 44m.
The results, at the high end of analysts' expectations, would have been even
better but for the weakness of the US dollar, the currency used in shipping
contracts.
Group turnover fell slightly, to Fl 1.66bn from Fl 1.68bn. However, on a
comparable basis, taking into account the dollar's decline and corporate
divestments, turnover rose by nearly 5 per cent in the period, Nedlloyd
said.
In shipping, operating profit fell to Fl 24m from Fl 37m. In road haulage,
operating profit rose to Fl 23m from Fl 12m, extending the strong trend that
emerged in the second quarter.
The third-quarter figures take net profit for the first nine months to Fl
78m, reversing the Fl 123m loss in the same period of 1993.
