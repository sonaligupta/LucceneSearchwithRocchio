FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Japan and US in last-ditch talks


   By REUTER


   WASHINGTON


The Japanese trade minister, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, flew into Washington
yesterday in a last-ditch effort to avert a sanctions showdown with the US.
President Bill Clinton has given Tokyo until Friday to open some of its
markets or risk punitive action on items such as car parts and glass.
Commenting on the sanctions threat, Mr Hashimoto said: 'We will try to keep
that from happening. That's why I'm here. We'll make efforts. We don't know
how it will turn out.' A US official said every option was on the table.
'These kinds of deals are often struck at the last minute, so who can say
until you've seen your opponent's last hand,' the US official said. Some
aides are forecasting that the outcome of the talks may be a partial deal
and partial sanctions, but that could well shift as the deadline nears.
