FT  02 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hafnia Holding shares suspended

HAFNIA Holding, the embattled Danish financial services group, yesterday
asked for its shares to be suspended while police investigate transactions
by a senior manager on the company's behalf.
The suspension came a day before subscriptions open for the group's rights
issue, which is intended to raise DKr2bn (Dollars 341m) to stabilise the
group's financial position.
The group's equity capital has been virtually exhausted, partly as a result
of the unsuccessful attempt last winter by Hafnia and Norway's UNI
Storebrand to acquire control of Skandia, Sweden's largest insurance
company, and by falling bond and share prices in Denmark this summer.
Hafnia's latest problem was discovered when it was called on to redeem
options to buy shares in Interbank, a small bank owned by the listed
professional soccer club, Brondbyernes Fodbold.
The purchases of Interbank shares were intended to secure loans from
financial houses to the football club, according to Hafnia.
The options, for a sum totalling DKr288m, were established without the
knowledge of the directors, Hafnia said.
The deputy general manager responsible for the deal has been dismissed and
police have been asked to investigate the transactions.
The options were made at a share price which is higher than the intrinsic
value of Interbank, a difference amounting to DKr35m to DKr45m, said Hafnia.
