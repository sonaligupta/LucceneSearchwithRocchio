FT  01 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US may face South Korean challenge on
Uruguay Round


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


South Korea yesterday served notice it may challenge US implementing
legislation for the Uruguay Round when the World Trade Organisation is set
up next year, writes Frances Williams in Geneva.
Seoul is angry that the legislation gives the US trade representative the
right to designate which countries count as developing in applying the new
subsidies accord. South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore have thereby been
excluded. Raising the issue at a meeting of the WTO preparatory committee in
Geneva, South Korea said the US had not challenged its developing country
status during the Uruguay Round negotiations. Hong Kong said the US
legislation was contrary to the practice of 'self-selection' for such status
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, told the meeting that 36
countries had now ratified the Uruguay Round trade pact. None of the Quad
group of leading traders - the US, European Union, Japan and Canada - have
yet done so.
