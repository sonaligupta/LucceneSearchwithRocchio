FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: US cable TV group buys India
stake

   NEW DELHI


Falcon Cable TV of the US has acquired a 40 per cent stake in Asianet
Satellite Communications, a Madras-based television network, to help expand
the Indian company's Rs1.2bn (Dollars 38m) multi-channel regional language
cable network, writes Shiraz Sidhva in New Delhi.
Falcon will invest nearly Rs600m in Asianet and provide state-of-the-art
technology to expand Asianet's year-old network to 50 channels, primarily in
three south Indian regional languages.
Asianet beams its programmes off Russian satellite Ekran M, and has a unique
cabling system, which uses Kerala state's electricity poles for trunk
cabling.
Falcon, the 12th largest cable company in the US with 1.1m subscribers in 27
states, hopes to bring its expertise in the latest fibre optic cable
technology to India eventually.
Although the Indian government has not officially deregulated television,
satellite networks such as Star TV from Hong Kong have captured nearly 20m
of India's 335m television viewers.
