FT  07 JAN 94 / Polish share deals tax is mooted


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


The Polish finance ministry is considering imposing a transaction tax on
share dealings on the Warsaw Stock Exchange to head off criticism of its
budget proposals, presented to parliament yesterday.
The move came as the new centre-left government braced itself for criticism
on its budget from its own parliamentary supporters. The budget constituted
a concession to left-wingers in the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD)
parliamentary group.
The exchange enjoys a general tax holiday due to run until the end of 1995.
Mr Leszek Miller, labour minister, argues his ministry's budget should be
increased and has threatened to call for a capital gains tax if his demand
is refused.
The draft budget's spending and deficit targets are within International
Monetary Fund guidelines. Mr Marek Borowski, finance minister, yesterday
urged his coalition deputies, who enjoy a clear majority in parliament, not
to change it when it goes into committee stage.
The proposed budget assumes revenues will reach 610,000bn zlotys (Pounds
19.3bn) this year while the 83,000bn zloty deficit will correspond to 4.1
per cent of GDP. The mooted 1 per cent transaction tax on exchange dealings
would raise around 2,500bn zlotys this year, but could engineer a crash just
as the government is looking to a series of flotations to move ahead with
its privatisation programme.
