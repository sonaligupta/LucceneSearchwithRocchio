FT  05 JUN 92 / Post Office deal 'breaks ground'


MORE than 12,500 Post Office counter staff will be able to claim paid leave
if they adopt children, as part of a pay deal that the UCW communications
union believes breaks new ground in the public sector.
The deal also means postal officers and assistants as well as retail
assistants will receive an increase of 4.25 per cent on basic pay and some
allowances. Part-time staff will now have the same sick pay arrangements as
full-timers.
