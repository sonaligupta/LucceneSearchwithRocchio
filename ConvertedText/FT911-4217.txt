INVESTORS turned back to second-liners yesterday, as share prices on the big
board fell on index-linked selling by investment trusts prompted by the
weaker yen and higher bond yields, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 256.93 to 26,541.97, 0.2 per cent lower on the week,
after a high of 27,042.90 and a low of 26,699.67. Volume fell to 360m
shares, as institutional investors focused on the second section, which rose
21.01 to 3,404.88. The over-the-counter section added 50.94 to 3,086.02.
Losers led advances by 695 to 302, with 150 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks fell 13.48 to 1,998.07 and in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.85 to 1,506.49.
Investors were discouraged by the lack of monetary easing by the central
bank, following Thursday's release of March money supply figures which
showed growth of 4.9 per cent, the smallest rise on record.
Interest rate-sensitive issues retreated, with Nippon Steel and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries down Y2 to Y480 and Y783 respectively. Financials were also
lower with Bank of Tokyo declining Y60 to Y1,320 and Nomura Securities
falling Y40 to Y2,170.
Mitsubishi Electric fell Y8 to Y793 on oversupply concerns. The company
plans to issue D-Mark and dollar denominated warrant bonds in the near
future.
Mitsubishi Rayon, a synthetic fibre maker, added Y5 to Y538 on reports that
an affiliate had developed a high-powered industrial water purifying system.
Japan Steel Works, a cast steel maker, rose Y15 to Y700 on strong earnings
projections. The company expects a 20 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for
the current year, thanks to development projects in suburban Tokyo.
Small and medium capital issues backed by strong earnings projections gained
ground. Keyence, the measuring control equipment manufacturer, added Y800 to
Y16,600, and Sega Enterprises, the game maker, rose Y500 to Y12,200.
Traders noted that speculative issues were gaining popularity. Nihon
Nohyaku, an agrochemical maker, rose Y290 to Y2,250 and Tokimec, a hydraulic
equipment maker, rose Y10 to Y1,060 on speculative buying.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 176.29 to 29,899.69 on volume of 33.7m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, which had been sold recently on
margin position concerns, recovered Y200 to Y17,000.
