FT  19 APR 94 / Observer: Power play


Meanwhile, latest word from Kuala Lumpur is that normal relations between
Malaysia and Britain could be restored before too long. The rumours appear
to have been prompted by Daim Zainuddin, one of Malaysia's wealthiest
businessmen, who recently returned from a trip to London.
Daim, a close confidant of Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has come up
with an ingenious reason why Malaysia's ban on doing business with British
companies - imposed after sections of the British press said unflattering
things about the Malaysian prime minister - could be lifted within three
months.
Part of the problem in resolving the row has been the less than warm
personal relations between Major and Mahathir. Having surveyed the British
political landscape, Daim has concluded that Major will not be around too
much longer. So when the new man comes into Downing Street Mahathir will
take the opportunity of burying the business hatchet. All very neat - but
not necessarily a theory No 10's present incumbent would agree with.
