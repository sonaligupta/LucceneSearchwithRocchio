FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance & the Family: The Week Ahead


One of the most important results of the week will be announced on Monday
when British Steel reports figures for the year ended March. Investors will
be hoping there is no repetition of the near 20 per cent fall in the share
price immediately after the half-year figures, but the numbers this time are
likely to make grim reading.
City forecasts vary widely but are all negative, from pre-tax losses of
Pounds 75m to Pounds 165m - against profits in 1990/91 of Pounds 254m. The
big question is what happens to the final dividend - the interim was
unchanged at 3p but was accompanied with a veiled warning about the final
pay-out. The total dividend payment in 1990/91 was 8.75p a share.
General Electric Company will disclose on Wednesday in its results for the
year ended March that it is building up a 'cash hillock', a smaller version
of the cash mountain it built in the 1970s. It should have net cash of about
Pounds 600m, with about the same amount tucked away in its joint-ventures
with Siemens, Alcatel Alsthom and General Electric of the US.
Most analysts expect GEC to unveil pre-tax profits of between Pounds 820m
and Pounds 840m against Pounds 818m a year earlier. Kleinwort Benson
forecasts that profits of about Pounds 840m should allow a marginal increase
in the divided to 9.5p from 9.3p last year with earnings per share up to
18.7p from 16p last time.
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, is expected to to report a
significant fall in pre-tax profits and a cut in the interim dividend when
it announces results for the six months to March 31. Pre-tax profits are
expected to be between Pounds 25m to Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 109m.
Most analysts expect the dividend to be cut in half, from 5p to 2.5p. Some
believe it may be passed altogether.
