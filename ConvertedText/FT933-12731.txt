FT  22 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


TIN hit fresh 20-year lows on the LME as half-hearted support near Dollars
5,000 a tonne for three-month metal was decisively broken. Dealers said sell
stops were triggered below the previous low of Dollars 4,990. Talk that
fresh shipments of Far Eastern metal are heading for Europe underlined
negative fundamentals. ALUMINIUM'S advance was scuppered by selling and
resistance near Dollars 1,230 a tonne for three-month metal and the market
eased back to end at Dollars 1,221.50. Dealers said recent speculative
buying and good support below Dollars 1,200 suggested that the market might
have bottomed out. There is also likely to be caution over the possible
closure of Alcan's Kitimat smelter, as 275,000 tonnes of capacity is
threatened by possible strike action on Friday. Chicago WHEAT futures were
mostly firm on some concern about losses of US wheat yields and quality
because of the rain in the Central and Northern Plains, traders said. The
harvest has been stalled in some areas and slowed in others and the ripening
crop in the Northern Plains is receiving more rain than it needs. Warmer and
drier weather is needed to help ripen the crop and aid harvesting.
