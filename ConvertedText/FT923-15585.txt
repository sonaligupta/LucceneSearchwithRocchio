FT  01 JUL 92 / Move to cut local red tape


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE government moved yesterday to reduce the amount of red tape businesses
encounter in their dealings with local authorities.
Nine councils will establish partnerships with local business groups to draw
up guidelines to help businesses conform with regulations, under a pilot
programme announced by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister.
Small businesses often find it hard to comply with regulations covering such
areas as trading standards, environmental health, social services, planning,
building control and fire safety.
The local authorities in the project will set up consultation groups with
businesses to discuss issues and to draw up booklets.
The booklets will set out the authorities' regulatory responsibilities,
explain what information is available and where it can be found.
They will lay down performance standards that businesses can expect from the
authority on, for example, the response time to inquiries, and explain how
businesses can complain or appeal against a decision. The booklets are due
to be published by early next year.
The authorities include county and borough councils from Kent, Suffolk,
Ipswich, Nottinghamshire, Barnsley, South Ribble and Hounslow, west London.
