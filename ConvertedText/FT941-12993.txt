FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Philip Morris drops 72% to
Dollars 339m in fourth term

   NEW YORK


Last year's cut in the price of Marlboro cigarettes and a heavy
restructuring charge combined to produce a 72 per cent slump in net profits
to Dollars 339m for Philip Morris, the US cigarette, food and beer group, in
the fourth quarter.
However, the company claimed its cigarette pricing strategy was working
because Marlboro had regained market share, showing that consumers were
prepared to make decisions based on brand preference rather than price
alone.
Group operating profits fell by 28 per cent to Dollars 1.95bn in the fourth
quarter because the downturn caused by lower domestic cigarette prices
outweighed a 13 per cent increase in operating profits from the rest of the
group's businesses.
The company took a Dollars 457m charge against net earnings for the
restructuring it announced in November, involving the loss of 14,000 jobs
and the closure or scaling down of 40 plants. Earnings per share fell to 38
cents from Dollars 1.34.
Results for the full year were broadly in line with those predicted by the
company in November.
Sales were 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 60.9bn, but after the restructuring
charge and a Dollars 477m provision for accounting changes, net earnings
fell to Dollars 3.09bn from Dollars 4.94bn the previous year. Earnings per
share fell by 35 per cent to Dollars 3.52 from Dollars 5.45.
Claiming success for the 40 cents reduction in the price of Marlboro and its
other premium cigarette brands last April, Philip Morris said research
showed that Marlboro had increased its share of the US market from a low of
21.5 per cent before the cuts to 26.6 per cent in November.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman and chief executive, said Philip Morris had
emerged from 1993 a stronger and more competitive company.
