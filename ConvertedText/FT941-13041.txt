FT  27 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Small companies


After four years in the doldrums, small company shares finally delivered in
1993. Measured by the Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index, the minnows
delivered a total return of 44 per cent last year, outperforming the market
by the largest margin since 1978. The composition of the index is a partial
explanation; interest rate-sensitive stocks such property companies are
clustered in the lower reaches of the market, while unfashionable consumer
goods companies are scarce. But size itself appears to be just as important
as sector. The bottom tenth of the index measured by market capitalisation
delivered a total return of almost 100 per cent.
If recovery stays on track there could be more to come. Manufacturing and
capital goods companies stand to benefit most as the UK economy turns, and
are also heavily represented among smaller capitalised stocks. The recent
outperformance of the FT-SE Mid 250 index, which is also weighted in the
direction of manufacturers, suggests that investors appreciate as much. As
with the very largest companies, though, much now depends on whether
companies can deliver the earnings and dividend growth implied by high
ratings.
There are also risks along the way. While the number of bankruptcies among
smaller companies fell sharply in 1993, the experience of the 1980s suggests
that trend might be expected to reverse this year as some companies
over-reach going into recovery.
