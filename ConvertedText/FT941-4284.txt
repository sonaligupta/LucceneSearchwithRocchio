FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Argentine oil and gas group's
earnings surge


   By CARMEN PIGNOTTI


   BUENOS AIRES


YPF, Argentina's leading oil and natural gas concern, has reported a surge
in profits for 1993, due mainly to improvements in downstream operations.
The net profit of Dollars 706m compared with Dollars 256m in 1992, with
sales totalling Dollars 3.96bn against Dollars 3.87bn.
The higher margins, spurred chiefly by investments in refining and
marketing, offset the fall in crude prices to about Dollars 15 per barrel
from Dollars 19 at the start of 1993.
Extraordinary charges were also sharply down last year, totalling Dollars
43m compared with Dollars 155m in 1992.
YPF said it would propose a Dollars 387m special dividend for the Argentine
government, which owns a 20.2 per cent stake in the company, as well as a
cash dividend of Dollars 282m for other shareholders.
The government sold most of its stock to private investors in an
international public offering last year.
YPF has set an upstream budget of Dollars 974m in 1994, up from Dollars 530m
last year. The company plans to spend Dollars 249m on downstream operations
in 1994 compared with 1993 levels of Dollars 117m.
It also intends to raise in 1994 crude production to 138m barrels, up from
107m in 1993.
