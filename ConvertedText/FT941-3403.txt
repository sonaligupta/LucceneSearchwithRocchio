FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wimpey bounces back into black with Pounds
25.5m


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Wimpey, following its biggest ever pre-tax loss of Pounds 111.6m in 1992,
bounced back into the black last year with pre-tax profits of Pounds 25.5m.
Trading profits rose 85 per cent from Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 40.9m, boosted
by a strong recovery in UK housing, with completed sales up by a quarter to
6,936.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.64bn to Pounds 1.59bn. The final dividend
is again 3.25p, maintaining the total for the year at 5.25p, just covered by
earnings of 6.81p a share.
Housing, in spite of only breaking even overseas, moved from a Pounds 33.3m
loss in 1992 to a Pounds 25.4m profit last year. Operating margins in the
UK, having fallen in every year since 1989, more than doubled from 3 per
cent to 6.5 per cent last year. This compared with a peak of 19 per cent
four years ago.
Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive, was optimistic about further rises in UK
house sales and margins, with prices already starting to edge off the bottom
in south-east England.
He said the company had seen no evidence that tax rises due to take effect
next month were dampening demand from prospective purchasers.
Wimpey would be selling its house building businesses in France, Spain,
Australia and southern California to concentrate on its UK and other US
housing operations. Also still up for sale was Pounds 135m of commercial
property investments.
The group has raised more than Pounds 300m from disposals, transforming its
balance sheet and reducing gearing from 30 per cent to 5 per cent, the
lowest level for 20 years.
Net debt of Pounds 28m at end-December, however, is expected to rise this
year as the group increases land purchases, while UK house sales are
expected to top 7,500 during the period. Gearing was likely to reach 30 per
cent, implying net debt of about Pounds 160m.
Construction profits halved from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 2.2m on turnover down
from Pounds 683m to Pounds 659m, reflecting the difficult conditions in the
UK. The figures however excluded Pounds 8m of interest on advanced payments
on construction projects.
Minerals, helped by a Pounds 7.9m windfall planning gain, rose to Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 1.6m).
COMMENT
Wimpey's results were bang in line with expectations. Even so its share
price fell 8p to 210p following the figures. The market having given the
company credit for rebuilding its balance sheet is concerned about where it
goes next. There is concern that its emphasis on first time buyers will mean
that margin recovery may be restricted. The UK aggregates business also
compares unfavourably with its main rival, Tarmac. The company talks bravely
of acquisitions and organic expansion, but now needs to deliver. Profits of
Pounds 45m put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 20. The shares,
after a good run, are now suffering.
