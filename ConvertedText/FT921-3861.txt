FT  12 MAR 92 / International Company News: Stora tumbles 61% on weaker
demand


   By JOHN BURTON


STORA, Europe's biggest pulp and paper company, yesterday reported a 61 per
cent fall in profits after financial items to SKr1.09bn (Dollars 179m) for
1991 as it announced management changes, writes John Burton.
Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, the head of the Stora Papyrus fine paper division,
has been appointed president of Stora. He succeeds Mr Bo Berggren, who will
be chairman of Stora once Mr Peter Wallenberg retires.
Despite the sharp earnings fall Stora will retain an unchanged dividend of
SKr13. Sales rose 8 per cent to SKr67.1bn.
Although weaker demand and competitive price-cutting were largely to blame
for the slide in profits, restructuring costs also increased by 50 per cent
to SKr504m as Stora continued a three-year programme to eliminate 6,000 jobs
by the end of this year, reducing its labour force to 39,000.
Mr Berggren warned a further 500 job cuts might be necessary. Stora said it
was difficult to predict the outlook for 1992. It believed competition would
remain tough in the product areas of printing paper and fine paper, due to
excess production capacity.
