FT  04 SEP 93 / Ofgas clarifies stance on profits


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


OFGAS, THE gas industry regulator, has no intention of dictating to British
Gas how to deploy its profits, Sir James McKinnon, the director-general,
said yesterday.
But he stressed that the company would not be allowed to raise prices for UK
domestic consumers to make good losses incurred in overseas expansion.
'That's a non-starter,' he said.
Sir James issued a statement after a report in yesterday's FT that Ofgas was
keen to 'ring fence' British Gas's Pounds 1.2bn domestic profits to protect
them from costs associated with high-risk overseas projects.
Mr Greg McGregor, the director of competition and tariffs, indicated that
draft proposals were being presented to the company. The proposals would be
part of the restructuring which British Gas is expected to undergo following
last month's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report recommending a
break-up of the company.
Sir James said Ofgas's stance would not prevent the company deploying
domestic profits to finance foreign activities if it wanted to.
British Gas said the MMC report had found no evidence that it had
underinvested in the UK or that the gas supply business had been adversely
affected by the growth of its overseas interests.
