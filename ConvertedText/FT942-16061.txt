FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Suzuki writes off Y8.54bn for
Santana


   By REUTER


   TOKYO


Suzuki Motor, the Japanese minicar maker, said it wrote off Y8.54bn (Dollars
81.2m) of bad debt from its exposure to its troubled Spanish unit, Santana
Motor, in the year to March 31 1994, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Santana is
owned 83.7 per cent by Suzuki.
Santana stopped output two months ago when its labour union went on strike
in protest against management restructuring plans which involved reducing
the workforce of 1,400 by 60 per cent.
Suzuki said the company was standing by its November forecast of parent
current profit of Y18bn in 1993-94, down from Y20.48bn in the previous year.
