FT  28 MAR 92 / International Company News: Benetton advances 23.6% to
L164.8bn

BENETTON, the leading Italian casual clothing concern, raised net group
profits by 23.6 per cent to L164.8bn (Dollars 131.8m) last year, thanks to
higher sales and improved financial management.
Group turnover rose by almost 12 per cent to L2,303bn despite increasingly
difficult market conditions. Benetton sold 83m items last year through a
chain of over 6,500 shops in 100 countries.
The rise in earnings has prompted a L50 increase in the dividend to L300 a
share, a decision which will be welcomed in financial markets.
In 1991, Benetton surprised analysts by slashing its dividend by half to
L250 in a drive to reinforce self-financing at a time of strong growth.
The effect of tougher financial controls and a lower payout to shareholders
was evident in the group's balance sheet, with net debt falling to L171bn at
the end of 1991 from L233bn in 1990. The burden of net interest costs fell
to 1.8 per cent of sales, from 2.2 per cent in 1990.
Benetton drew attention to its controversial advertising campaign, dedicated
'to universal themes of a social character', which it said had helped to
reinforce a homogeneous international image for the group. Spending on
advertising and sponsorship amounted to L108.2bn last year.
Sales of its Sisley brand rose particularly strongly, with a 34 per cent
increase.
