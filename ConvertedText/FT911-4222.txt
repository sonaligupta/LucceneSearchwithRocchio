FT  20 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options Trading


The share index futures market was depressed yesterday by uncertainty over
the timing of the next reduction in UK interest rates and the deepening
recession.
A decline on Wall Street added to the weaker tone and created a background
for investors to take profits after the recent strong rise.
The June FT-SE 100 index traded in a range of 2,536 to 2,565 before
eventually settling at 2,544, a fall of 24 points on the day. June's premium
to the cash index finished at 25 points, compared with brokers' 31-point
fair value estimate, which is an estimate of future dividend payments and
the cost of finance.
Elsewhere in the derivative markets, the bond issue by Hanson earlier in the
week continued to stimulate interest in stock options. The August 240 calls
remained a popular series.
The slide in Asda shares triggered turnover in July 110 calls as worries
grew about possible profit downgrades next week when the company meets
analysts.
Rolls-Royce was actively traded and as one of the most liquid stock options
continued to attract attention. The June 200 calls were the most actively
traded series.
The Amstrad June 70 puts featured as a broker downgraded its profit
estimates and the shares weakened.
