FT  27 OCT 92 / Dushanbe quiet as rebels retreat


   By STEVE LEVINE

DUSHANBE, the Tajikistan capital, was mostly quiet last nightafter the
government, backed by units of the Russian army, defeated a two-day coup
attempt by supporters of the former Communist president.
The rebels left Dushanbe after the government of acting President Akbarshah
Iskandarov promised that a special parliamentary session would decide
whether Mr Rakhmon Nabiyev, who was ousted from office at gunpoint last
month, should be reinstalled.
More than 2,000 irregular troops patrolled the city last night. There was
occasional gunfire.
The coalition Tajik government of pro-Islamic and democratic parties has
fought forces loyal to former President Nabiyev since May in battles that
have killed more than 1,000 people. The pro-Nabiyev forces possess
substantial arms, including armoured vehicles, but analysts said they seemed
unlikely to mount a new challenge to the government soon.
Part of the reason is a lack of leadership. Two of the three strongest rebel
military leaders were either killed or wounded in the coup attempt, which
began at dawn on Saturday.
Mr Rustam Abdourahim was killed and Mr Langari Langariyev wounded: both were
leaders of the irregular militia recruited from the southern Kulyab region.
The political leader of the coup attempt, Mr Safarali Kendjayev, former
parliamentary speaker, was wounded by his own troops when Commonwealth of
Independent States forces escorted the rebels out of Dushanbe on Sunday
night.
