FT  04 MAR 94 / Russian hard line angers Estonia


   By AP


The former Soviet republic of Estonia will today decide whether to break off
talks on the pullout of 2,600 Russian troops from its territory, after
Moscow said it was not committed to any firm withdrawal date, AP reports.
'We have threatened to break off talks,' Estonian foreign minister Juri Luik
said yesterday, adding that the main issue was Russia's backing off from its
deadline of August 31 this year. Mr Luik said a decision on whether to
suspend the nearly three-year talks would be made today at a special cabinet
meeting.
