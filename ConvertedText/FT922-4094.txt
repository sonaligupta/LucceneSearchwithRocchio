FT  08 JUN 92 / Ministers hopeful on EC hours rule


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


MINISTERS are confident that the new uncertainty about the Maastricht treaty
makes it unlikely that the disputed working-time directive will be imposed
on the UK when employment ministers meet on June 24.
The directive, which includes the proposal for a maximum working week of 48
hours, averaged over three months, has been delayed by UK objections. It was
expected the directive would be forced through at the meeting. Britain
cannot veto it as it is being introduced under EC health and safety rules
and needs only a qualified majority.
The directive, amendments notwithstanding, is still unpopular with the
government. Department of Employment officials say the government will
either abstain or vote against at the meeting.
After the Danish referendum result, however, British ministers are more
optimistic that other EC countries which support the directive will not want
to be seen to be imposing an important measure on a recalcitrant country,
for fear of inflaming more hostility to European integration.
That means that if the directive is to be accepted at all, the UK proposal
that no worker can be forced to work more than 48 hours but may do so if he
or she wishes, will probably have to be swallowed by several countries -
particularly France - that wanted something tougher.
The Portuguese presidency of the EC is still expected to want an agreement
on the working-time directive on June 24 but will now have to ensure that it
is watered down enough for the UK not to vote against.
If that is not possible a decision may be delayed again. The UK would then
argue that the issue should be dealt with in the 'social chapter' which 11
countries, excluding the UK, agreed at Maastricht.
