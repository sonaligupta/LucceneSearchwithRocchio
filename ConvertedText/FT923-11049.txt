FT  27 JUL 92 / Fishermen drift towards a net loss


   By CHRIS TIGHE


THE ANCIENT tradition of drift-net fishing for salmon and sea trout off
England's north east coast would be phased out under proposals published by
the National Rivers Authority, Chris Tighe writes.
Around 400 fishermen using little wooden cobles, reminiscent of Viking
longboats, depend on salmon drift netting for their livelihood in the spring
and summer.
The Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food invited the authority to draw
up plans to phase out the 143 drift net salmon licences between Holy Island
in Northumberland and the Humber following claims from Scottish and English
riparian owners and anglers that drift netting is depleting river salmon
stocks.
The ministry said there was no evidence it posed immediate threat to stocks
but suggested they could be better managed if the netting were ended.
Critics describe the 600-yard long monofilament drift nets which are played
out across the tide as 'curtains of death'. The fishermen, who deny they are
responsible for the decline in salmon stocks, liken their nets to 'a pair of
shoe laces in Wembley stadium'.
Under the authority plan, licences would be reduced as netsmen leave the
fishery, resulting in a halving of drift netting activity over 10 years and
its phasing out over about 30 years. Last year about 30,000 salmon, and a
similar number of sea trout, were drift netted off the north-east coast.
The fishermen are now considering whether to object to the proposals, a move
which would force a public inquiry.
