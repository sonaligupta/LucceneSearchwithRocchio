FT  20 MAY 92 / Ugly roar from a young tiger: Unequal rates of economic and
political development have brought violence to the streets of Bangkok


   By VICTOR MALLET


One of the enduring myths fostered by Thais about their country is that
there is a peculiar and subtle 'Thai way' of conducting business and
politics. The phrase is used to explain everything from compromise and
flexibility to corruption and hypocrisy.
Even in the face of evidence to the contrary, Thais have long been proud of
what they see as a unique system of avoiding confrontation and
unpleasantness. 'We Thai people hate violence,' said a shop owner on Monday
from a vantage point at the top of a Buddhist temple, even as gunfire echoed
through the capital and rioters set fire to a car in the street below.
The concept of the 'Thai way' has been shattered by the events of the past
few days. 'Welcome to Thailand,' said a Thai businessman when he spotted a
foreigner in a lift in a city centre office building yesterday. 'Land of
smiles - and bullets.'
The sight of soldiers shooting pro-democracy demonstrators - at least 21
people are reported to have been killed and hundreds injured in the past
three days - and of rioters ransacking government buildings, has appalled
local businessmen and foreign investors who once put their trust in the
'Thai way'.
Army brutality and the savagery of the rioters makes an ugly contrast to the
growing industrial and financial sophistication of Bangkok. Thailand has
undergone rapid economic development in the past decade, based on foreign
investment and export promotion, but the political system of military
influence, corruption and patronage has failed to evolve at the same pace.
The fact that this failure, which is shared to a greater or lesser extent by
the other dynamic economies of south-east Asia, has become such a critical
obstacle to stability in Thailand is disturbing news for foreign investors
in the region.
Japan in particular has been making unusually loud anxious noises. 'The
Japanese government is deeply concerned about the rising tensions in Thai
politics and wishes a peaceful and rapid return to order,' Mr Koichi Kato,
the Japanese government spokesman, said yesterday.
Foreign investors had been wary of Thailand since last year's coup d'etat
arranged by General Suchinda Kraprayoon, who was then armed forces chief and
is now struggling to retain his new post as prime minister. Net foreign
direct investment from Japan, Europe, the US and elsewhere fell to Dollars
1.2bn last year from Dollars 1.5bn in 1990, and investment in the stock
market was down to Dollars 68.5m from Dollars 455m.
But it has taken a series of pro-democracy demonstrations to convince many
Thai and foreign businessmen that there was a real danger of confrontation.
Less than two weeks ago Mr Olarn Chaiprawat, the senior vice-president of
Siam Commercial Bank, said he was telling worried foreigners businessmen
that 'there would not be anything violent and the situation should return to
normal soon'.
This week's events will compound the problems Thailand now faces as it seeks
continued investment. It faces stiff competition from industrial exporters
in south-east Asia, such as Indonesia, which have lower wage costs. Thailand
needs infusions of foreign capital and technology to shift the emphasis from
textiles and agricultural products to electronics and other high-technology
industries. It also needs to raise from local and foreign sources an
estimated Dollars 8bn over the next five years for transport projects in the
Bangkok area alone, as well as finding funds for other infrastructure
improvements throughout the country.
For the moment, the economy shows little signs of losing steam. After three
years of double-digit economic growth between 1988 and 1990, it expanded by
more than 8 per cent last year. While this has made Thais in general and the
inhabitants of Bangkok in particular increasingly prosperous, several
factors have undermined their sense of wellbeing: severe pollution, the
inability of chronically weak political institutions to reflect their
concerns, and the absence of the rule of law.
It is no coincidence that the violence has been centred on Bangkok, where
the dislocation between economic sophistication and national political
immaturity is so glaring. Bangkok is the only large city in Thailand; the
metropolis and the area around it account for three-quarters of the
country's industrial gross domestic product, and it is in Bangkok that most
of the educated elite and the middle class reside.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the ascetic Buddhist opposition leader arrested by
troops on Monday, is immensely popular among almost all sections of Bangkok
society. He opposed corruption during his two terms as the city's mayor and
his Palang Dharma (Moral Force) party won 32 of the 35 seats in the general
election in March this year.
Nationally, however, the election was won by a coalition of five
pro-military parties which used the traditional method of cash hand-outs to
buy the votes of millions of peas ants in the countryside. The Samakki Tham
(Justice Unity) party which won the largest number of votes was an
organisation established after the 1991 coup specifically to entrench the
influence of the military establishment in civilian politics.
The inadequacy of Thailand's corrupt, quasi-democratic political system and
its failure to meet the aspirations of Bangkok's middle class is a more
profound reason for this week's violence than the ineptitude of Gen Suchinda
himself.
After he arranged the 1991 coup which overthrew the elected government of
Gen Chatichai Choonhavan on the grounds that it was too corrupt, the
military surprised and delighted the foreign and local business community by
appointing Mr Anand Panyarachun, a respected businessman and former
diplomat, as interim prime minister.
It was an inspired choice, and the Anand administration was regarded as the
best that Thailand has ever had. Mr Anand built on the achieve ments of Gen
Prem Tinsulanonda, prime minister for eight and a half years until 1988, by
pushing through a series of economic liberalisation measures and resisting
demands for more weapons from the military officers who had appointed him.
His tenure, which ended with this year's election and the subsequent
imposition by pro-military parties of Gen Suchinda as prime minister, now
seems like a pleasant dream compared to the horror of the past few days.
If Gen Suchinda had not underestimated the resentment felt by Bangkok's
increasingly educated citizens towards the heavy-handed involvement of the
military in politics and business, the country's adaptable and dynamic
economy would doubtless have muddled through as it has in the past. The
violent results of that miscalculation have now been seen around the world,
reducing Thailand's international image, in the words of the Bangkok Post,
'to nothing better than a banana republic'.
Foreign investors who used to shrug off Thailand's usually bloodless coups -
there have been 18 since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932 - are now
profoundly concerned, although they say it is too early to make accurate
predictions of the damage to the Thai economy.
'It's very bad news,' said one foreign banker yesterday. 'I told my staff
today that they won't get sacked tomorrow, but that they should have no
illusions: this is going to be bad for our business.'
Tourists - more than 5m visited the country last year and earned Thailand
more than Dollars 4bn in foreign exchange - have already begun to cancel
holidays. The impact on commerce and industry is more difficult to assess,
but rumours of renewed rioting prompted most shops and offices in the
capital to send their staff home and close early yesterday.
The head of one multinational company predicted that Thailand would find it
difficult to raise money on international markets and could face
difficulties with its balance of payments. Thailand might have lost a year
of economic development because of the violence, he said. 'It looks like
you're not talking just about something getting a bit out of control, but a
much deeper problem.'
Thai businessmen appear to be universally gloomy. After a holiday on Monday,
the stock exchange index fell nearly 9 per cent yesterday to its lowest
level this year, with many stocks falling to the lower limits set by the
exchange. Thais queued at banks to withdraw money from their accounts.
In an attempt to calm the markets, the central bank said it had prepared a
30bn baht cash reserve to provide commercial banks with standby baht funds
and was ready to draw from its Dollars 20bn foreign exchange reserve to meet
any heavy demands for US dollars. For the time being the responsibility for
containing the damage to Thailand's reputation as a haven for investors
rests with Gen Suchinda and his military colleagues.
The signs last night were not hopeful. In an abrasive statement on national
television, Gen Suchinda blamed the violence on com munist instigators,
while the citizens of Bangkok - few of them communists - seemed adamant that
they would continue to demand his resignation. Although young men with
motorcycles have been burning cars and smashing traffic lights in the city
centre, Bangkokians rich and poor generally blame Gen Suchinda and the
military rather than the rioters for the trouble.
These are the worst disturbances since the 1970s and one of the hopes
espoused by Thais is that their revered monarch, King Bhumipol Adulyadej,
will intervene to help change the government as he did when student
demonstrators confronted the authorities in 1973. Another possibility is a
split in the military and yet another military coup.
'Thailand,' wrote Joseph Wright in The Balancing Act, his history of the
country, 'is full of optimists. Thais like to believe that things, sooner or
later, will work out for the best.' Yesterday, however, Thais were
uncharacteristically pessimistic, knowing that they will need to call on all
their famed spirit of compromise to return the country to political and
economic stability after the disastrous events of this week.
