FT  08 NOV 94 / International Company News: Ina chief denies Treasury
influence


   By ANDREW HILL


The new chairman of Ina, the recently privatised Italian insurer, yesterday
dismissed claims by his predecessor that the company was still under the
influence of the Treasury, its majority shareholder.
Mr Sergio Siglienti, the new chairman, said there were no government
representatives on the new 13-man board, elected yesterday, which showed the
company was ready for the second phase of privatisation, due to take place
next year.
Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, the outgoing chairman, claimed the Treasury, which has a
52.75 per cent stake in Ina, 'still determined the attitudes and choices' of
the company. Mr Pallesi's name was omitted from the Treasury's list of 10
nominees to the board.
Yesterday's shareholder meeting was the first in Italy to use a new voting
system, which reserves three boardroom seats for directors nominated by
minority shareholders. But small investors claimed the new system had not
lived up to expectations of shareholder democracy.
The seats were filled by nominees of Imigest, a fund manager with a 0.5 per
cent stake in Ina. They are Mr Giampietro Nattino, deputy chairman of the
Italian association of securities houses, Mr Jean Claude Damerval, managing
director of Axa of France, and Mr Anthony Louis Brend, former chief
executive of Commercial Union.
