FT  29 APR 94 / World Trade News: AT&T and China sign contract


   By REUTER


   NEW YORK


The US telecommunications giant AT&T said yesterday it had won a long-sought
contract to sell its products and services in China, Reuter reports from New
York. It said the agreement would be 'worth billions of dollars over time'.
The company has won more than Dollars 500m in sales contracts in China since
signing a memorandum of understanding last year to explore opportunities for
a long-term partnership.
The deal signed yesterday in New York specifies what AT&T will do to help
China upgrade its telecommunications infrastructure in six areas.
Mr William Warwick, chairman of AT&T China, which was formed after last
year's memorandum was signed, said the deal would solidify the company's
role in the world's largest telecommunications market.
The company would not give a specific amount of the value of the new
agreement, which calls for AT&T to invest more than Dollars 150m in China
over the next 24 months. It expected to triple its current workforce of 800
employees in China over the next couple of years.
One potential problem is the US government's impending decision whether to
extend China's most favoured nation trading status.
