FT  12 APR 94 / UK Company News: Alpha Airports meets target - Current
trading up to expectations and joint venture formed


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Alpha Airports Group, the airline catering company floated by Forte in
February, matched its prospectus forecast with a 19 per cent increase in
operating profits to Pounds 20.6m.
Pre-tax profits, struck on pro forma turnover ahead 5 per cent to Pounds
423.3m, rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 19.2m.
Mr Richard Gold, finance director, said Alpha was optimistic about the
current year in light of an expected 4 to 5 per cent increase in the number
of airline passengers in the UK. 'We have got a strong UK market this year,'
he said. 'There has been quite an increase, particularly in the charter
market.' Current trading was 'well up to expectations'.
The group also announced the first of two joint ventures promised at the
time of flotation. It is joining forces with British West Indian Airways at
Trinidad's Piarco airport, paying Pounds 700,000 cash for a 40 per cent
stake in Airline Caterers, Piarco's sole caterer, which last year generated
sales of Pounds 3m.
Mr Gold said Alpha hoped to announce a second joint venture within the next
three months.
The company also opened two new kitchens, in the US and Manchester. Capital
expenditure during the year came to about Pounds 12m.
Net debt rose from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 28.8m, representing 82 per cent of
shareholders' funds. Mr Gold said gearing should be reduced to between 50
and 60 per cent by the end of this year.
The strongest performance came from the airport retailing business, which
increased operating profits by 40 per cent to Pounds 5.9m; sales were 3 per
cent higher at Pounds 213.5m.
Mr Gold said this division would benefit from the expansion plans of airport
operators. 'We will see quite an abnormal increase over the next few years
in the UK marketplace,' he said.
The airline catering division increased operating profits by 12 per cent to
Pounds 14.7m on sales ahead 6 per cent to Pounds 209.8m.
Notional earnings per share were up 32 per cent on a pro forma basis at
8.89p. The company warned that the earnings figure related to Alpha as part
of Forte and might not reflect the level generated as an independent
company.
The first dividend will be paid at the interim stage. Forte received Pounds
33.5m in dividends last year.
