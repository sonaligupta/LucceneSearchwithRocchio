FT  06 AUG 93 / Technology: Car information in front of your eyes - Worth
Watching


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


The technology to project the information from a car instrument panel on to
the windscreen has long been mooted. The Weizmann Institute of Science, in
Rehovot, Israel, has developed a holographic technique which could some day
deliver the goods.
This twin hologram system exploits ordinary light - no laser is needed  -
and the optics are just a few millimetres thick, unlike conventional bulky
lenses.
The new system, which is being exploited by Yeda Research and Development,
consists of two holograms coated upon glass. One receives light signals of
an image and diffracts them at an angle. The second projects this image on
to the desired spot. Yeda: Israel, 8 46 35 10.
