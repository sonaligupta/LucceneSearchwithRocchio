FT  27 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Plan to extend life of
marginal SA gold mine


   By PHILIP GAWITH


WESTERN Deep Levels (WDL) and neighbouring Blyvooruitzicht (Blyvoor), two
South African gold mines, have reached an agreement which should extend the
troubled Bylvoor's life by about eight years.
The logic of the deal, which involves Blyvoor mining 92 hectares of the WDL
lease area, is that Blyvoor has easier access to the area covered by the
deal than WDL.
Working profits and capital expenditure will be shared, with WDL, which is
owned by Anglo American, receiving 55 per cent and Blyvoor 45 per cent.
