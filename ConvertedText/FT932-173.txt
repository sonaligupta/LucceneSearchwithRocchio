FT  30 JUN 93 / Lloyd's risks losing its top agencies


   By RICHARD LAPPER


SUCCESSFUL Lloyd's agencies may be about to quit the insurance market in the
wake of record losses, Chatset, the research company which monitors Lloyd's,
has warned.
'Names must watch the situation closely to ensure that Lloyd's does not
become an agglomeration of the second-rank agencies, with the leading
agencies splitting themselves off and becoming autonomous insurance
companies,' said Chatset yesterday, presenting its review of the market's
performance in 1990.
Lloyd's last week reported a loss of Pounds 2.91bn for 1990, the last year
for which it has released figures.
Chatset added: 'There are signs that Lloyd's may be breaking up through
successful agencies declining to support a market which has notched up
substantial losses through bad management and poor underwriting,'
Last month five Lloyd's agencies put members' agents 'on notice' that they
might not be prepared to continue managing syndicates in 1994.
In at least two of the cases the agencies are contesting new rules which cap
the level of fees they can charge Names - the individuals whose assets
support the insurance market.
Chatset said some agents 'wonder if they need Lloyd's at all to run a
commercial organisation'.
The company's review of the 1990 results shows a wide variation in the
performance of the syndicates trading at the market. While five marine
syndicates reported profits of more than 10 per cent of their stamp capacity
 -the premium they are allowed to underwrite according to Lloyd's rules - 18
marine syndicates reported losses of more than 100 per cent of their stamp
capacity.
Syndicates 475 and 745, both of which specialise in catastrophe reinsurance,
were the two worst-performing syndicates, with losses equal to more than 200
per cent of capacity.
Syndicate 952, a small non-marine syndicate, was the best performer in 1990.
