FT  01 DEC 94 / International Company News: American Brands to sell Franklin
Life


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


American Brands said it had reached an agreement to sell Franklin Life, its
life insurance business, for Dollars 1.17bn, and that the proceeds would be
used mainly to buy back shares and pay down debt.
In connection with the sale, made to financial services group American
General, the company said it would buy back up to 10m of its shares.
Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, also said yesterday that the
company intended to look for further 'strategic acquisitions, focusing on
our long-term growth businesses - hardware and home improvement products,
office products and golf and leisure products - and on distilled spirits'.
The sale of Franklin Life would result in a book loss of Dollars 220m,
American Brands said. This results in part from a provision for net income
to cover the period before the sale is completed, when the company will be
accounted for as a discontinued business.
American Brands paid Dollars 645m for Franklin in 1979. Since then, it said
it had received some Dollars 650m in cash dividends from the company.
The sale comes in the wake of American Brand's plan to sell its US tobacco
businesses to BAT Industries, which is being challenged by US regulators,
and the sale of Dolland & Aitchison, an optical company, for Dollars 146m.
