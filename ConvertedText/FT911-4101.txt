FT  20 APR 91 / Finance & The Family: All-Share lags behind


   By PHILIP COGGAN


Although the FT-SE 100 Index has been hitting new highs, the broader FT-A
All-Share Index has yet to pass the peak of 1238.5 it reached in July 1987.
It has come close in recent weeks, closing at 1232.32 on April 5, but
smaller company shares have still not recovered from the battering they
received in 1989 and 1990.
