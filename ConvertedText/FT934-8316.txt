FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: KLM reviews Alcazar position


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


   THE HAGUE


KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said cutting costs and bolstering its position in
the aviation market had reduced its dependence on a partnership being
negotiated with three other European airlines.
Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, stressed that KLM stood wholeheartedly behind
efforts to arrive at a partnership with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines
System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines under the code name Alcazar.
However, Mr Bouw added that KLM's programme of lowering costs and improving
service to passengers meant that KLM was less dependent on the alliance than
it had been.
Internal cost-cutting had allowed KLM to take part in the talks without its
'back to the wall', he said.
'What we want to avoid, and what we have avoided, is that partnership is
KLM's only strategy for survival,' he said. He was speaking less than two
weeks after KLM unveiled a better-than-expected 20 per cent increase in net
profit for the 1993-94 second quarter.
Mr Bouw said this did not mean that KLM had changed heart about the alliance
but said his comments tried to explain why the carrier had sought to lift
productivity over the past few years.
The four-way merger talks have become bogged down by difficulties in
choosing a US partner airline. Each airline, with the exception of Austrian
Airlines, has a partner in the US.
