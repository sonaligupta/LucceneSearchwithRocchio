FT  28 SEP 94 / SEC seeks boost in powers


   By AP


   NEW YORK


The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is calling for legislation
that substantially increases the watchdog agency's power to oversee mutual
fund activities. In a report to be presented to Congress today the SEC
requests improved access to information 'to monitor adequately mutual fund
investments, including investments in derivatives'. It is recommended that
funds use a 'quantitative risk measure' of derivatives in fund filings and
that the SEC re-examine leverage restrictions put on funds by mutual fund
oversight laws. The agency also requests that mutual funds keep additional
records to 'enable the inspection staff, among other things, to analyse a
fund's derivatives instruments'. The agency asks that it be given power to
require funds file information with the agency electronically and on a more
frequent basis. Along with additional legislative powers, the SEC said it
needed more money and more staff. The SEC report was requested by Rep Edward
Markey, chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee.
