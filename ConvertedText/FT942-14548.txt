FT  20 APR 94 / Warning on lack of telecom standard


The growing band of telecommunications carriers were warned yesterday to
agree common standards for the technology which makes it possible to
identify the telephone number of an incoming call.
Mr Don Cruickshank, director-general of telecommunications regulator Oftel,
said he had no power to enforce a single standard for calling-line
identification. Yet if the industry did not respond to his warning he would
find other ways of ensuring customers were neither confused nor exploited by
a multiplicity of incompatible equipment.
Calling-line identification, which should benefit users by making it
possible to recognise familiar or welcome calls and avoid nuisance or
malicious ones, has been possible for some time. But the industry has so far
failed to work to common standards so that all customer equipment will work
with all networks.
