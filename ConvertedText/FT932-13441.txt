FT  23 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: EC aid for Scots/Ulster power link


SIR Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs yesterday that
the European Community was prepared to make a contribution toward the cost
of construction of an electricity interconnector under the Irish Sea, which
would provide the first electricity power link between Scotland and the
province.
Last year the go-ahead was given for a gas pipeline from Scotland to Ulster.
Sir Patrick said an interconnector would end the isolation of the Northern
Ireland electricity system and increase security of supply. But he stressed
that the go-ahead was subject to planning permission.
