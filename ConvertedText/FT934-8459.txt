FT  16 NOV 93 / Belgian strike campaign launched


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


BELGIAN unions yesterday took part in the first of a planned series of
strikes to protest against proposals to cut wage costs and improve
industrial competitiveness.
Ministers from Belgium's centre-left coalition were last night said to be
entering the final stages of talks on measures which should cut social
security payments and increase indirect taxes.
Foreign investors and currency markets are watching the negotiations
closely. Analysts believe that if the government does not attack Belgium's
central problem of a looming budget and welfare deficit, the Belgian franc
will come under renewed speculative pressure. During September and October,
the Belgian central bank had to fight hard to maintain its strict policy of
shadowing the D-Mark.
Some market analysts said yesterday they feared Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
Belgium's Christian Democrat prime minister, might have to water down his
strict line on government spending, to avoid a schism with his Socialist
coalition partners.
Yesterday's industrial action was particularly successful in Wallonia, the
French-speaking southern part of Belgium, paralysing the region's industry.
That only emphasised the difficulties for the government, because the
French-speaking Socialist members of the coalition are the most uneasy about
the government's plans.
