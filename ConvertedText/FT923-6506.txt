FT  24 AUG 92 / Letter: A tourist's tale of London


   From Mr MOHAMAD A VAYID


Sir, The matter with the British economy is not just government policy, nor
the position of sterling within ERM. I spent a period in London in June and
July and I can report a catalogue of difficulties.
After spending a few hundred pounds on bed linen at John Lewis in Oxford
Street, I could not have it packed for carriage on the plane. The export
department, to which I was directed, dismissed my request, saying it only
answered enquiries and executed orders from overseas.
At Debenham's, a folding table and chairs, described as being in stock and
available for quick delivery, could be delivered to an address merely 2km
away only several days later. The salesman would not even arrange, when told
that the buyer was leaving London that day, for delivery before noon.
A suit bought at Harrods needed a minor alteration and I was asked to
collect it the following week. A telephone call confirmed it was ready. But
when I went to the shop and tried it on, the work had not been done. I was
asked to return. No luck this time also: the alteration was faulty. The
third time, I was lucky. The extra taxi fares: Pounds 32.
Barclays Bank, in Putney High Street, refused to honour a draft for Dollars
500 in favour of an account holder because it had to check whether Mauritius
had 'enough foreign currency to cover this amount'. As this could take time,
the account holder presented the bank manager with a cheque from a friend
for Pounds 150 drawn on Lloyds. Told it might take five days to clear, the
account holder asked the manager to fax Lloyds to confirm the cheque was
good, offering to pay any extra charge. The manager refused.
To redeem itself, British business needs to go back to the basics of
salesmanship.
