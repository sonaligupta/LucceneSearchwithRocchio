FT  10 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Bank sells off tap in rising market


   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON


   LONDON, NEW YORK


UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained nearly a quarter of a point yesterday, allowing
the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its Pounds 1bn tap issue in the
rising market.
The Pounds 1bn tranche of 8 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2007, which has
been overhanging the market, was exhausted in afternoon trading.
The Bank of England has supplied amounts of the partly-paid tranche on
several occasions since it was announced on December 13.
Volumes in the futures market were relatively high, with over 25,000 gilt
futures contracts traded on Liffe. The 10 per cent gilt due 1996 rose from
100 29/32 to trade at 101 1/8 by late afternoon while the benchmark 11 3/4
per cent gilt due 2003/07 increased from 115 to 115 29/32 to yield 9.4 per
cent.
THE European government bond markets gained up to half a point yesterday,
encouraged by the US economic data and rumours of a moderate German wage
settlement. Traders reported strong buying interest in the high-yielding
European markets from Far Eastern, European and US investors, many of whom
are reallocating their portfolios for the new year.
In Germany, trading was mainly futures-driven, with the Liffe bund futures
contract bursting through the technical resistance level of 88.01. The
contract, which started the day at 87.67, climbed as high as 88.22 before
closing at 88.19. The market has tested this resistance level earlier in the
week.
The bund market was lifted by rumours that German steel workers had agreed
to a moderate pay increase of 5 per cent, and by favourable US economic data
and higher-than-expected German unemployment figures.
In France, the government bond market opened firm in response to the release
of weak German employment data and was boosted later in the day by the rally
in US Treasury bond prices.
On the Matif futures exchange in Paris, the March bond futures contract
closed at 108.92, up 0.56 from late Wednesday. Volume was well above average
at over 170,000 contracts.
AFTER a bright opening on good inflation news, US Treasury prices fell
across the board yesterday amid increased nervousness about today's
important jobs figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 107
1/16 , yielding 7.403 per cent. The two-year note fell even further,
dropping  3/16 to 100 1/2 , yielding 4.714 per cent.
Bond prices had initially firmed after the Labor Department reported a 0.2
per cent decline in the producer price index for December. Separately, news
of a 22,000 jump in weekly unemployment insurance claims had also bolstered
sentiment.
Prices later retreated, however, as dealers trimmed their positions for fear
of being caught long ahead of what some rumour-mongerers said would be an
unfavourable December employment report. The report, due out this morning,
is expected to show a decline in non-farm job payrolls of between 50,000 and
100,000.
JAPANESE government bond prices slipped on opening due to the weaker yen,
but rebounded later to close slightly higher on the day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.32 per cent and moved in the
range of 5.275 to 5.325 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 5.29 per cent.
At the Finance Ministry's auction of 5.5 per cent 10-year bonds, the average
accepted bid was 100.77, yielding 5.381 per cent, while the lowest accepted
price was 100.65, yielding 5.399 per cent.
Both the average bid and lowest accepted bid were regarded as surprisingly
high by traders. Total bids were Y2,875bn, giving a bid-to-cover ratio, or
ratio of total bids to the amount sold, of 6.08.
The Finance Ministry sold Y472.65bn - or about 60 per cent of the Y800bn new
issue - at auction yesterday and will offer the remainder through the
underwriters' syndicate. The 5.5 per cent coupon is 50 basis points lower
than the coupon on the bonds issued in December.
