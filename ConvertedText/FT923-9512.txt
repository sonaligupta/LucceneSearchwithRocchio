FT  05 AUG 92 / Failure figures down on last year


   By ANDREW JACK


THE NUMBER of receivership and administration appointments in July fell,
compared with the same month last year, for the sixth successive month,
according to figures released by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm,
yesterday, Andrew Jack writes.
The statistics, based on an analysis of notices in the official London and
Edinburgh Gazettes, show appointments at 474, compared with 549 in July last
year. That is the highest number of appointments since March, and brings the
total this year to 3,192, compared with 3,464 in the first seven months of
last year.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said he did not share the pessimism of some other commentators about the
continued extent of the recession. The reducing level of appointments might
reflect the high level of support being given by banks to struggling
businesses.
