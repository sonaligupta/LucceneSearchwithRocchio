FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: Travel competition takes its
toll on profits at Accor

Accor, the French travel group which is fighting the UK's Forte for control
of the Meridien luxury hotel chain, yesterday announced a 23 per cent fall
in net profits, to FFr615m (Dollars 105.1m) last year from FFr802m in 1992.
The group has lodged a bid with Meridien's owner, Air France, in the hope of
merging the business with its Sofitel luxury hotels.
Accor was badly affected last year by intense competition in the European
travel business, particularly in the French market.
Accor, which had previously issued a profits warning for 1993, also had to
service the remainder of the debt amassed in its 1991 takeover of
Wagons-Lits, the Belgian travel company.
In spite of the fall in net profits, the board proposed holding the dividend
at FFr18 in 1993, the same as in 1992.
