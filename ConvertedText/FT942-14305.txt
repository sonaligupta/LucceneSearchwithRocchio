The Brazilian government has eliminated or cut import duties on 19 products
in an attempt to put pressure on local companies it suspects of imposing
excessive price rises, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo. A government
ordinance which came into effect yesterday , cuts the tariff on 17 products
to 2 per cent. They include beer, soft drinks, instant coffee and tyres.
Most of the products were subject to duties of 10-20 per cent. The measure
also eliminated import duties on condoms and aluminium cans.
On March 11 the Finance Ministry cut duties on 14 items ranging from steel
products to medicines. The government said the tariff cuts, which are
expected to be temporary, have been sparked by 'abusive' price rises imposed
by local oligopolies since 1990.
