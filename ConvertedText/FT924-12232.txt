FT  21 OCT 92 / Letter: CNN business programme


   From Mr PIPER PARRY


Sir, I would like to clarify Raymond Snoddy's piece referring to World
Business Today, the daily business programme broadcast on CNN International
(October 9). As the article states, at the end of this year, by mutual
agreement, CNN Business News and Financial Times Television will no longer
jointly produce World Business Today. However, the article does not make
clear that CNN International will assume sole responsibility for the
programme and it will continue to be aired.
