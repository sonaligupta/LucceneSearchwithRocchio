FT  30 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Futures close easier


   By PETER JOHN


FINANCIAL futures contracts eased slightly on the last trading day of the
month following technical presures and comment in the UK suggesting that
interest rates may not fall as fast as expected, writes Peter John.
Short sterling was volatile, dropping in the afternoon after Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, said he was not confident that
a cut in UK base rates would fit the government's goals for inflation.
Some dealers suggested the comments acted as a useful excuse for traders
keen to balance trading books at the end of the month. The futures contract
for December, which had reached a high of 94.64 in earlier trading dropped
to close four basis points lower on the day at 94.55.
The German Euromark contract for the same month eased slightly to 93.85 and
the French contract fell four basis points to 93.60, both slipping on
end-of-the-month adjustments.
Monetary conditions in the UK money market continued tight as banks were
unwilling to take up the Bank of England's early offer of help. The Bank of
England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.85bn, later revised
down to Pounds 1.75bn but by midday only Pounds 28m of help was provided.
The tight conditions pushed overnight rates to 9.5 per cent and one-month
money to 6 15/16 per cent. Among the main factors affecting the position
were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands
which drained Pounds 1.852m from the system.
A rise in note circulation - traditionally heavy on a Friday as banks
prepare for big withdrawals from cash machines over the weekend - withdrew
Pounds 810m. Partly offsetting, these Exchequer transactions added Pounds
1.555bn.
The Pounds 28m of assistance at midday consisted of Pounds 6m of band one
bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent and Pounds 22m of bills for resale to the
market in equal amounts on November 16, 17 and 18 at an interest rate of 5
29/32 per cent.
The Bank provided a further Pounds 1.525bn assistance in the afternoon. It
bought Pounds 840m of band one bank bills and Pounds 6m of band two bank
bills, both at 5 7/8 per cent.
The Bank also bought Pounds 679m of band two bank bills for resale to the
market in equal amounts on 16, 17 and 18 November at 5 29/32 per cent.
Finally, the Bank gave Pounds 220m of late assistance.
