FT  20 MAY 92 / International Company News: Pinault sale severs link with
origins in timber

PINAULT, the French company which recently won a controversial bid for the
Au Printemps department store chain, is severing its links with its original
timber interests by selling the business to Dapta-Mallinjoud, the French
do-it-yourself group.
The withdrawal from timber marks the culmination of the strategy pursued by
Pinault under the chairmanship of Mr Francois Pinault. He has transformed
his family timber company - founded in Brittany in 1963 - into a large
retailing group by a series of audacious acquisitions.
The series of deals, which culminated in the takeover of Au Printemps, one
of the most famous names in French retailing, has left Pinault with a hefty
burden of debt. The proceeds from the sale of the timber business - for an
undisclosed sum - will be used to reduce group borrowings which totalled
FFr15.5bn (Dollars 2.9bn) at the end of last year.
Pinault has sold a group of companies - including the Lafa furniture
businesses and Sofiseb, a kitchen unit manufacturer - with combined sales of
FFr1.13bn. Dapta-Mallinjoud, which is quoted on the secondary market in
Paris, suspended its shares on Monday pending the announcement of the
acquisition. It sees the deal as a way of expanding its original
do-it-yourself interests into new product sectors. After the disposal
Pinault will be established as a leading player in the French service sector
with the Conforama chain of furniture stores as well as Au Printemps.
Pinault's total annual turnover is now estimated at about FFr70bn, with
distribution providing 80 per cent of that total.
Pinault recently announced that its net profits had halved from FFr1.05bn in
1990 to FFr503m in 1991. That was attributed to a sharp fall in exceptional
earnings.
