FT  30 OCT 93 / Solicitors could face probe into house fees


THE OFFICE of Fair Trading may investigate into whether pricing cartels are
being operated in the house conveyancing market, Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general, signalled yesterday.
He told delegates at the annual conference of the Law Society that he wanted
to 'flag' the possibility of cartels as an issue of concern. 'One does hear
from time-to-time indications that there may be pricing cartels, for example
in such areas as conveyancing,' he said.
Later Sir Bryan said he was not in a position to say there were pricing
cartels, but there had been complaints on the grounds that groups of
solicitors might be charging a minimum price.
