FT  07 JAN 94 / People: Another occupation for Carr


The Occupational Pensions Board, which oversees occupational pension
schemes, has a new chairman, despite recommendations in the Goode report on
pension law reform that the OPB be replaced by a regulatory body with much
wider powers.
Peter Carr, 62, chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority and of
the County Durham Development Company, has been appointed for a three-year
term by Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, while the
government makes up its mind as to the sort of regulation required in an
immensely complicated area.
He succeeds Harriet Dawes who goes back to being deputy chairman. Dawes had
only been in the chair since September, when she adopted what she said at
the time was to be a caretaker role until the OPB's future became clearer.
A labour market economist who studied at Ruskin College, Oxford, Carr gained
a reputation during his nearly four-year stint at NRHA as an unusually
independent-minded chairman. In April, the NRHA and the more populous
Yorkshire Regional Health Authority, are set to merge. No announcement has
yet been made as to who will chair the combined entity, but Carr says that
the job he has been doing, while paid on the basis of three and a half days'
work a week, in practice requires him to be on hand day and night.
Carr's previous experience includes working at ACAS in its early days.
Between 1978 and 1983 he worked in Washington as labour attache, before
returning to become northern regional director of the Department of
Employment until 1989.
Parrying widespread criticism that the OPB has been ineffectual, the new
chairman says that it is a body containing a great deal of intelligence
about the pensions industry that has given government 'very wise and
soundly-based advice'. He chairs his first board meeting on Monday when the
board formulates its own response to the Goode report.
