FT  13 APR 94 / International Company News: First-half loss at Deutsche
Babcock


   By AP-DJ


   OBERHAUSEN


Deutsche Babcock, the German engineering and plant construction group,
suffered a loss in the first half of its 1993-94 fiscal year which began
last October 1, AP-DJ reports from Oberhausen.
It gave no figures but said results were better than the previous year.
Mr Heyo Schmiedeknecht, chairman, made clear yesterday the company wanted to
resume payment of its common dividend, last paid for fiscal 1988, after
having resumed payment of a DM3 preferred dividend for fiscal 1993 after a
two-year hiatus.
But even more important, he said, was to continue the company's programme of
streamlining, 'cost what it will, without regard to earnings cosmetics'.
Babcock has said it intended to pay a dividend only if the group's pre-tax
profit reached DM120m (Dollars 70.1m).
'There is better than a 50 per cent chance' of a dividend being paid, Mr
Schmiedeknecht said. 'Off-hand, I would say there is a 60 per cent chance.'
Babcock's projection for group pre-tax profit in the current fiscal year is
DM80m to DM120m, after pre-tax earnings of DM62m in fiscal 1993.
Although Babcock's pre-tax and net profit figures fell steeply in fiscal
1993, the drop was largely attributable to extraordinary factors.
All of the group's divisions were now operating in the black, Mr
Schmiedeknecht said.
