FT  21 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of
political pact


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


REPORTS that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and opposition
parties were ready to strike an agreement over parliamentary testimonies by
leading LDP politicians bolstered sentiment, and the Nikkei average closed
above the 17,000 level for the first time since November 5, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 162.29 to 17,033.60, a rise of 4.3 per cent on
the week. The index fell to the day's low of 16,679.64 in the morning on
profit-taking, but gathered upward momentum on index-linked arbitrage
buying, setting a day's high of 17,188.37 in the afternoon.
Volume fell marginally from 319m to 300m shares ahead of the long weekend.
The market is closed on Monday for a public holiday.
Advances led declines by 544 to 434 with 149 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first-section stocks rose 2.38 to 1,276.91 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei
50 index added 0.07 to 1,026.00. Comments by leading politicians suggesting
an imminent conclusion of the current political stalemate prompted investors
to place buy orders. Mr Kozo Watanabe, minister of international trade and
industry, said that the government's supplementary budget package would be
approved in parliament early in December.
Bank shares were higher on short-covering. Industrial Bank of Japan gained
Y40 to Y2,410 and Fuji Bank gained Y10 to Y1,780.
Dealers actively traded speculative theme stocks. Mitsui Mining and
Smelting, which previously attracted buying on reports that gold veins were
found in the company's mining area, was the most active issue of the day,
rising Y9 to Y481, while SS Pharmaceutical advanced Y20 to Y1,230.
Trading companies lost ground on reports of large hidden losses on tokkin,
specified money trusts. Nichimen fell Y12 to Y345 and Marubeni lost Y2 to
Y377.
Electronic issues lost ground on corporate and foreign selling. Hitachi fell
Y16 to Y710 and Toshiba fell Y3 to Y609.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 68.84 to 18,280.46 in volume of 27.1m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, rose Y100 to Y10,100 on
bargain-hunting.
Roundup
ADVANCES led the declines among the region's markets at the end of a
volatile week.
BANGKOK ended 4.5 per cent higher on the day, but 4.1 per cent lower after a
topsy-turvy week, as the finance ministry began to use a Bt5bn fund to buy
up shares. The market had plunged in the previous two days on legal action
by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a major investor and his
associates.
The SET index rose 37.55 to 871.72 in turnover of Bt10.64bn. The central
bank also encouraged investors back into the market and said that it was
making unlimited amounts of cash available to banks and finance companies to
help them with liquidity problems.
AUSTRALIA was underpinned by a recovery in banks as the All Ordinaries index
rose 17.3 to 1,410.1, up 2.1 per cent on the week.
Westpac and ANZ rose 6 cents to ADollars 2.73 and 9 to ADollars 2.79 after
reporting 1991-92 losses within expectations this week.
TAIWAN climbed on strong buying of financial shares and on news that Oung
Ta-ming, head of the Hualon Group and a major market player, had decided to
be a candidate in the December legislative election. The weighted index rose
41.95 to at 3,724.33, 4.7 per cent higher on the week.
HONG KONG rose for the second day, the Hang Seng index ending 23.38 higher
at 5,878.79 but 7.7 per cent lower on a week during which the apparent
Sino-British rift widened. Turnover shrank from HKDollars 4.57bn to
HKDollars 2.75bn.
BOMBAY recovered from a sharp two-day fall after the BSE authorities
tightened curbs on sales. The BSE index rose 56.30 to 2,479.56 but fell 4.1
per cent on the week.
