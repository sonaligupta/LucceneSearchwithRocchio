FT  27 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By GARY MEAD


This is the evening you have been looking forward to for ages, when the TV
promises such a dire selection, you can comfortably curl up with a good book
instead.
Tales from the map room (BBC2, 8pm), a series on the history of maps,
tonight looks at map-making during the First World War tank battles of
Cambrai.  Rik Mayall presents (ITV, 9pm) was oddly compelling last week, and
this second one hour comedy-drama may please some.
But who on earth watches Sylvania Waters (BBC1, 9.30pm), surely the nastiest
piece of 30 minute tackiness now available on international TV? A
fly-on-the-wall documentary about an Australian family, it has no redeeming
features at all; quite in line with most current TV production standards
really.
My advice is to switch on Radio 3 instead and listen to one of the best
novelists in the US today, Alison Lurie (Night Waves, 10.45pm), discuss the
connections between fairy tales and modern story-telling.
