FT  26 JUN 92 / Japanese minivan ruling angers the Big Three


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


US car makers have suffered a setback in their efforts to win the imposition
of dumping duties on imports of Japanese minivans.
Although the Commerce Department ruled last month that Toyota, Mazda and
other Japanese manufacturers had sold their minivans in the US below
production cost, the International Trade Commission (ITC) decided this week
that US manufacturers had not been harmed by the imports.
Commissioners noted that minivans were one segment of the motor vehicle
market where domestic manufacturers still dominate, with an estimated 88 per
cent market share.
They said that Chrysler was selling as many vans as it could make, while any
problems Ford and General Motors had in selling their vans could be
attributed to the slow US economy and to their own product and price
shortcomings. The ruling infuriated the US motor industry, which had been
counting on the US unfair trade laws to help them hold back Japanese
competition.
