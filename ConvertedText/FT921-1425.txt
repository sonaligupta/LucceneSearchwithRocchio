FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tory gainers rise slightly


FOR THE first time since the election was announced, shares that might
benefit from a Conservative victory outperformed those that might benefit
from a Labour win. 'Conservative gainers' rose slightly yesterday while
'Labour gainers' fell. The Labour drop was greater than that suffered by the
FT-SE 100 index - the main indicator of big-company performance. Both
portions of the index are calculated on a base of 100 as at closing prices
on March 11, the election-announcement day.
