FT  19 APR 94 / Backing for tighter air aid rules


   By DAVID GARDNER


The European Commission yesterday won firm backing from transport ministers
to draw up clearer guidelines on government subsidies to state-owned
airlines. Brussels is expected to tighten the rules by June  - before
deciding on a controversial request by the French government to inject up to
FFr20bn (Pounds 2.34bn) into Air France. In spite of French misgivings
yesterday, and fierce lobbying by Paris, ministers agreed that 'new, clearly
defined rules on state aids. . . . should be drawn up by the Commission'.
Until now, Brussels has cleared most state aids to flag carriers on the
understanding that it was a 'last time' injection linked to restructuring.
This approach was endorsed in February by a Commission-sponsored 'committee
of wise men' drawn from the industry. But civil aviation liberals are on the
offensive, complaining that Air France, which has already had capital
injections approved by Brussels, was coming back for more.
