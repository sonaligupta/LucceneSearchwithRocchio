FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Argentina


BUENOS AIRES saw a 7.3 per cent drop in the Merval index to 335.21 and

Both fell last Friday on rumours that the economy minister, Mr Domingo
Cavallo, was to quit, but recovered slightly on Monday after President
Carlos Menem confirmed Mr Cavallo in his post.
