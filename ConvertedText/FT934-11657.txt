FT  30 OCT 93 / EC Summit: Medicine evaluation agency for London


   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor


THE European Medicines Evaluation Agency, which will co-ordinate drug
licensing and safety throughout the European Community, is due to start work
in London in 1995 with a staff of 300.
Officials at the UK department of health say EMEA could indirectly create
'several thousand' jobs.
'The agency will act as a magnet for the international pharmaceutical
industry,' Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Britain's health secretary, said
yesterday. It would attract European head offices of American and Japanese
drug companies and a host of consultants and lobbyists.
The UK government and drugs industry lobbied hard for the agency to come to
London.
From 1995, the EC will have a twin-track approach to drug licensing.
Companies will be able to submit a conventional medicine either to the EMEA
(the 'centralised' route) or to one of the 12 national regulatory agencies
(the 'decentralised' route).
