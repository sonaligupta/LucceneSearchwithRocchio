   BUENOS AIRES


Argentina's inflation rate fell to zero in August, its lowest level in 25
years, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. Inflation so far this year has
fallen to 5.8 per cent - almost a third less than in the first eight months
of last year - and official forecasts put next year's inflation rate at 4-5
per cent.
