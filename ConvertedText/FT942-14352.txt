FT  20 APR 94 / Business Air Travel (28): Airports of the world - Kai Tak
choked by success / Hong Kong


   By LOUISE LUCAS


Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport is a microcosm of the territory it serves:
compact, relatively efficient and hideously congested.
It is an airport past its sell-by date, having operated beyond capacity
since last year. Work on a better version is under way, though progress on
the key elements of the project remains hostage to Sino-British
disagreements over the funding.
With around 28 flights taking off every hour and a daily thoroughfare of
some 67,000 passengers, Kai Tak is in effect choked by its own success.
Immigration queues are long and processed slowly (customs officials,
possibly with reason, find it hard to believe Asian visitors would fly to
Hong Kong for a holiday and ulterior motives of employment are invariably
applied to holders of Philippine passports). Information is not as
accessible as it might be, especially at arrivals.
Despite requirements to arrive at the airport well in advance of flights,
there is little by way of amusement once passengers have checked in.
Shops selling duty free goods, books, souvenirs and sweets occupy cramped
premises that are soon filled out by backpackers.
Yet, despite being the third busiest airport in the world, Kai Tak is small
and contained under one roof.
