FT  20 APR 91 / BA's free seats day benefits rivals


   By DAVID CHURCHILL and ANDREW JACK


   BRITISH AIRWAYS' free seat bonanza next Tuesday


when passengers in the airline's 50,000 seats travel free - is giving a
boost to rival airlines which are attracting paying passengers unable to get
on to BA's flights.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is one of the main beneficiaries of the
BA promotion: all its Upper Class seats on Tuesday have been sold and it is
over-booked by up to 30 per cent on some flights.
'We're delighted but not surprised,' said Mr Will Whitehorn of Virgin
yesterday. 'This is what happens when you take one entire major carrier out
for the day.'
Swissair said that all its business class seats to Switzerland on Tuesday
were booked. Normally it would be at only 60 per cent of capacity on a
mid-week flight. Swissair has responded to the extra demand by substituting
larger aircraft on some routes as well as allocating more seats for business
travellers.
BA's move has also benefited its new challengers on the lucrative North
American routes. American Airlines said bookings on flights to Miami and
Dallas on April 23 were 'very healthy' and back to the level of before the
Gulf war.
Cathay Pacific said bookings were higher than normal on Tuesday but that
space was still available.
Business travel agents said both business and leisure travellers should be
able to find flights on Tuesday to most destinations covered by British
Airways.
'There might be a few aggrieved BA frequent flyers who resent losing their
normal seats on Tuesday but I think they are very few,' said Mr Nigel
Robinson, managing director of Pickfords Business Travel.
BA is not worried about the temporary boost to bookings with rivals. The
airline's senior management is understood to be jubilant at the worldwide
publicity its promotion has gained, at a cost of Pounds 16m.
