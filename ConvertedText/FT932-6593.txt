FT  27 MAY 93 / International Equity Issues: Rise in activity in convertible
paper sector

   LONDON, STOCKHOLM


THE CONVERTIBLE bond market has seen a pick-up in activity, with deals from
Amer of Finland, Ericsson of Sweden, and Societe Generale in recent days.
Further deals are expected soon, with Lend Lease, the Australian financial
services group rumoured to be considering a Dollars 200m Euro-convertible
bond.
Investment bankers point out that, with the outlook for some of the European
stock markets seen as 'rather uncertain', convertible bonds can provide
investors with a more 'defensive' investment instrument.
Amer, the Finnish consumer goods group, has announced terms for a Dollars
75m Euro-convertible bond issue, the first time such an instrument has been
launched by a Finnish company.
The coupon on the 10-year bond will be 6.25 per cent, and its conversion
price into Amer A shares will be FM144. This represents an 18 per cent
premium to Tuesday's closing price of FM122 on the Helsinki stock exchange.
The proceeds are being used to strengthen the group's balance sheet and to
raise the European profile of its Wilson Sporting Goods arm, which is
already well-known in the US.
The issue, which is being lead-managed by NatWest Securities and
Postipankki, is being targeted at international investors in Europe and the
US, where the bonds were placed under a Rule 144a private placing.
Societe Generale hopes to raise FFr3bn with its global offering of deep
discount convertible bonds. The bonds are priced at FFr660 and are repayable
at FFr800 at maturity.
Shareholders in Societe Generale have priority subscription rights on
FFr1.5bn of the bonds.
