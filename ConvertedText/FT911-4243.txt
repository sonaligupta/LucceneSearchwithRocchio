FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Moran forecasts little change


For the year to June 30 1991 Moran Holdings, the tea producer, freight
forwarder and property developer, expects to make an operating profit in
line with the previous year, and at least hold the dividend at 1p.
In his interim report Mr Colin Gordon-Smith, chairman, said the Indian tea
company will show a reduced profit. Climatic conditions meant a loss in crop
of some 480,000 kg, and the enhanced level of prices achieved in India had
been insufficient to compensate.
Trans Global was operating at good levels and should contribute usefully to
profits. Since the half-year the business travel companies were sold.
The joint property development in Manchester continued to operate
satisfactorily with sales at an encouraging level.
