FT  12 MAR 92 / Serbian students demand removal of President Milosevic


   By LAURA SILBER


   BELGRADE


Thousands of students yesterday gathered in Belgrade for a second time this
week to demand the removal of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. The
students rallied to mark the anniversary of anti-government demonstrations
last year, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. They demanded fresh elections
and an end to socialist control of the media. Serbia yesterday gave no
offical reaction after Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, appeared
to herald recognition of four Yugoslav republics as independent states. Mr
Baker said the US would consult the European Community on the question of
recognition.
