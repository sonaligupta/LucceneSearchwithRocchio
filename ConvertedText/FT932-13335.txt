FT  23 APR 93 / International Company News: Allied Signal lifted by
productivity gains


   By MARTIN DICKSON


ALLIED Signal, the high-technology group which has enjoyed strong earnings
growth since the arrival of a new chairman in 1991, yesterday reported a 22
per cent rise in first-quarter net income, helped by strong productivity
gains.
The group made Dollars 149m, or Dollars 1.05 a share, compared with Dollars
122m, or 87 cents, on a like-for-like basis in the same period of 1992, when
it took an accounting charge leading to a Dollars 1.1bn net loss.
Sales dipped 2.6 per cent to Dollars 2.9bn.
Mr Lawrence Bossidy, chairman, said: 'Despite first-quarter weakness
throughout the aerospace industry and severe recession in Europe, operating
margin expanded to 8.2 per cent from 6.1 per cent, while return on equity
remained about 26 per cent'.
He added that the gains were driven primarily by a 5.7 per cent increase in
productivity.
The engineered materials business saw net income rise 37 per cent, to
Dollars 67m, on sales which were 10 per cent higher than the previous year.
Automotive income was up 35 per cent at Dollars 42m on marginally higher
sales, with lower European revenues more than offset by North America.
Aerospace net income rose 9 per cent to Dollars 49m despite an 11 per cent
drop in sales.
