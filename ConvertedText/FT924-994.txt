FT  21 DEC 92 / S Korea's election results put opposition in disarray


   By JOHN BURTON

THE comfortable victory of Mr Kim Young-sam's in Friday's South Korean
presidential election has given him a secure mandate to govern while leaving
the opposition in disarray.
As the candidate of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Mr Kim
received 42 per cent of the vote against 34 per cent for Mr Kim Dae-jung of
the main opposition Democratic Party and 16 per cent for Mr Chung Ju-yung,
the founder of the Hyundai business group. His margin of victory was wider
than expected.
Mr Kim, who will take office late in February, is hoping to improve the
DLP's slim majority in the legislature as a result of his victory. The DLP
has 161 seats out of 299.
The poor performance of the opposition parties in the election is expected
to encourage some MPs to defect to the DLP. The switching of party
affiliation is normal practice in South Korean politics, with more than 30
MPs having done so this year.
The resignation of Mr Kim Dae-jung as opposition leader and MP following his
defeat is likely to cause factional in-fighting within the Democratic Party,
which was formed only a year ago from a merger of two parties.
There are doubts about the survival of Mr Chung's United People's Party,
which was established earlier this year to support his failed bid for the
presidency. Most of the UPP's 37 MPs would join the DLP if the conservative
party collapsed.
Mr Chung also has to worry about possible government reprisals against his
Hyundai industrial conglomerate as his political strength wanes.
The group has already been subject to government harassment this year,
including tax penalties and credit squeezes, because of Mr Chung's political
ambitions.
One factor that may protect Hyundai from a crackdown is its status as the
nation's largest business group.
