FT  01 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Markets


At the close of the second quarter, it appears that this column's suggestion
at the start of the year that UK investors would be better off in cash was
slightly on the gloomy side. According to County NatWest's preliminary
calculations, the return on cash so far in the UK is 5.2 per cent. This
beats UK equities, with a return of 5.0 per cent, but lags long gilts with
8.9 per cent and index-linked with 6.6 per cent.
This is consistent enough with a low-growth, low-inflation environment.
Oddly enough, though, even UK equities have done well in an international
context. Leaving aside the horrors of Japan, where this year's total return
has been minus 29 per cent in local currency, the London market has managed
to outperform Wall Street, whose total return has been approximately zero.
But there is one important caveat. Almost all the return from the UK equity
market so far has been in the form of dividends. As the year proceeds, it is
becoming apparent that dividends paid to date have been posited on an
over-optimistic view of the economic cycle. This is the more unfortunate if,
as seems logical, it turns out that in a non-inflationary environment income
is all that matters.
