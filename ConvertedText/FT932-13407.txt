FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: A measure to undermine Acas


   From Mr JOHN SHELDON


Sir, Anatole France, the French writer, observed that: 'The law in its
majestic equality, forbids the rich, as well as the poor, to sleep under
bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread.' Apparently, the present
government believes this to be a sound principle and wishes to extend it.
Having already begun the process of denying people access to the courts by
the curtailing of availability of legal aid, it seems ('Acas angry over plan
to make users pay for services', April 21) that ministers now wish to
restrict access to the services provided to workers by Acas, the arbitration
and conciliation service, in the industrial area as well.
Not content with abolishing Acas's statutory duty to promote collective
bargaining, this spiteful, penny-pinching measure will serve only to
undermine the very existence of Acas - or is that what the government wants?
