FT  13 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance


Judging by the near doubling of its share price in the last two months, the
market clearly believes Royal is out of intensive care. Yesterday's news
that it almost broke even in the three months to September - and managed its
first quarterly UK profit since early 1990 - underpins this view. But it
would also be foolish to underestimate the task Royal still faces in
returning to anything like rude health.
Like General Accident earlier in the week, Royal is conspicuously riding the
turn of the cycle. It was only a matter of time, of course, before the
impact of higher premiums would be felt. What is more encouraging is the
evidence of fewer claims, notably for subsidence and personal motor.
Continuing anxieties, though, are the medium-term damage which mortgage
guarantee losses could yet inflict, and the state of the balance sheet. The
two, of course, are connected. Today's solvency margin is closer to 30 per
cent than the stated 45 per cent if the life business is excluded, which
leaves Royal vulnerable to another unexpected wave of repossessions if the
economy again fails to respond to Mr Lamont.
In the short term at least Royal deserves the benefit of the doubt. There is
a real management story, while its operational and balance sheet gearing are
obvious attractions at this stage in the game. Further upside in the share
price, though, must be limited by the 3 per cent yield.
