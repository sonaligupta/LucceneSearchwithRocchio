FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Geest zips up Fisher


Geest, the fruit and produce group which slipped on a banana skin earlier
this year, has hired an expert to run its banana business: Bob Fisher, 55,
currently chief operating officer of Pacific Fruit Co (Noboa), an
international banana group, and formerly president of Dole, another banana
company.
Fisher, an American, joins Geest as managing director of Geest Banana Sector
on September 1, two months after the new EC banana regime came into force.
It was dumping of bananas in northern Europe ahead of the new regime which
squashed banana prices and caused Geest to warn on interim profits at its
annual meeting in May. Although continental banana prices have recently
taken a turn for the better and Geest's shares have recovered of late, the
interim results next month are expected to be gruesome.
At the same time, Geest is merging its slim-line main board with the
management board. Stuart Anderson, Peter Macielinski and Douglas McGrath,
members of the management board, are joining the main board and the
management board is being disbanded. Geest has also attracted Jim Maxmin
(above), chief executive of Laura Ashley, the fashion and home furnishings
manufacturer and retailer, as a non-executive director.
