FT  11 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cohen to launch Republic venture


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


MR PETER Cohen, who in early 1990 was ousted as chairman of the Shearson
Lehman brokerage subsidiary of American Express, has been recruited by Mr
Edmond Safra to become vice-chairman of the Republic New York Corporation
banking group to launch its newly approved securities business.
Republic, the holding company for New York area commercial and savings banks
that have combined deposits of Dollars 21bn and capital of Dollars 2.3bn,
won approval last month from the Federal Reserve to conduct a full-service
securities brokerage business in the US.
Mr Cohen was also named to Republic's board yesterday and as a member of the
executive committee.
The new securities subsidiary will begin operations with a staff of 43
people and initial capital of Dollars 100m. Its staff could eventually grow
to several hundred people.
Mr Safra, the Geneva-based financier, controls about 30 per cent of the
Republic group. He and Mr Cohen first met more than 20 years ago and did
business together during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1978 Mr Cohen left Wall
Street to spend one year working for Republic.
In launching its securities business, which will focus on brokerage and
investment advisory activities for Republic's affluent and largely non-US
client base, Republic joins the ranks of the very few US banks that are
allowed by the Federal Reserve into the securities sector.
The 45-year-old Mr Cohen said he began working as a consultant to the
Safra-controlled institution two years ago.
Mr Cohen said yesterday he expected to concentrate on developing a brokerage
business with a strong technology base that would offer a brokerage
execution capability for professional investors and Republic's high net
worth individual client base.
