FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Hagen wins place on Nedlloyd
board

MR Torstein Hagen, the London-based Norwegian investor who controls a 27 per
cent stake in Nedlloyd, was yesterday nominated to the Dutch transport
group's supervisory board, ending a year-long war of nerves between the
company's management and its single biggest shareholder.
Nedlloyd said Mr Hagen had pledged that his two investment vehicles, Marine
Investments and DNO, would be long-term investors in the Rotterdam-based
company.
Mr Hagen also promised to act in the interests of all 'stakeholders', to
accept the company's current strategy and to support the work of the
management board.
Marine Investments said in a statement from Luxembourg that 'the two
companies and Mr Hagen have, however, signalled areas in which they may want
to see a change, but have accepted that this will be part of the normal
process of the workings of a supervisory board'.
Relations between Mr Hagen and Nedlloyd reached a low point at the annual
shareholders' meeting in May, when he led a shareholder revolt that
culminated in the voting-down of the company's 1990 accounts.
The move was aimed at winning three seats for Mr Hagen and his supporters on
an expanded supervisory board. Mr Hagen later scaled down his demands to one
seat.
Mr Hagen and Nedlloyd have clashed in the past over the pace of divesting
businesses that do not belong to the group's two core sectors, ocean-going
shipping and overland transport.
