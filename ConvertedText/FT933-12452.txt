FT  23 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris rises late on currency
speculation


   By Our Markets Staff


SELECTIVE strength in late closing bourses, largely in response to currency
speculation, was the main feature of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS built up strength late in the session as currency speculation
resurfaced; the rationale was that it might now be just a matter of time
before the franc was forced to devalue. Some observers commented that the
suspension of the 5-to-10 day lending window and its replacement by a 24
hour repurchase facility was 'the last straw' in the government's battle
with currency speculators.
This view was not followed by more phlegmatic investors, who felt that there
was far too much at risk for European monetary authorities to allow the
franc to leave the ERM. Those in this camp maintained that the Bundesbank
would make meaningful cuts in interest rates by September, at the latest.
The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's low of 1,937, ended 18.19
higher at 1,965.72. Turnover was some FFr2.6bn.
Among the stocks set for early privatisation, confirmed by the government in
an announcement after hours on Wednesday, Elf Aquitaine gained FFr4 to
FFr396, Rhone-Poulenc lost 10 centimes to FFr142.90 and BNP CI's shed FFr2
to FFr539. UAP, which has a 10 per cent stake in BNP, gained FFr3 to FFr596.
BSN rose FFr17 to FFr850 ahead of announcing after the close a fall in first
half turnover of some 3.8 per cent; while SocGen put on FFr7 to FFr605
following its forecast of good half year profits.
ZURICH continued the rally which began late on Wednesday after the market's
consolidation earlier in the week, and the SMI index rose 25.4 or 1.1 per
cent to 2,340.5.
Mr Mirko Sangiorgio at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich attributed yesterday's
strength to renewed program buying. He expects the market to move sideways
over the next few weeks, and does not rule out the possibility of some
further volatility. 'But over the longer term, I take a more positive view
on expectations of a continuing decline in Swiss interest rates,' he said.
UBS bearers were in demand rising SFr21 to SFr1,140 and Roche bearers
returned to favour, adding SFr180 to SFr8,180.
Renewed strong foreign demand helped SMH SFr17 or 7.4 per cent up to SFr245
and Alusuisse SFr24 or 4.6 per cent ahead to SFr540.
FRANKFURT closed mixed, the DAX index easing a mere 0.29 to 1,823.52 and
moving marginally higher in the post bourse. A little profit-taking was
reported in chemicals, balanced by buying in engineering, metals and
utilities.
One of the biggest blue chip gains of the day came in Lufthansa, which rose
DM4 to DM134.50, up 16 per cent since Mr Robert Willis and Mr Rod Hinkel at
SG Warburg Securities recommended the airline on July 6 on the basis of
improving immediate performance, accelerated job cuts, increasing cost
savings in 1993 and 1994 and an impending solution to the group's unfunded
pensions liability.
Turnover eased from DM8.2bn to DM7.9bn. Improved construction and
modernisation prospects for eastern German energy plants left Felten &
Guilleaume, an energy technology company, up DM25.50, or 6.8 per cent at
DM400.50.
AMSTERDAM returned to positive territory, helped by the stronger dollar and
renewed buying of cyclicals. The CBS Tendency index ended 1.4 higher at
117.6.
KLM added Fl 1.50 to Fl 33.80 after announcing late on Wednesday that it had
reached an agreement with the pilots union on freezing pension
contributions, thereby cutting costs by some Fl 190m. The stock also
attracted a broker's upgrade.
The dollar's strength helped Royal Dutch, up Fl 2.30 to Fl 176.80 and
Unilever, Fl 1.00 higher at Fl 188.10.
MILAN became clouded once again by currency concerns, halting attempts at a
rally, and Comit index shed 5.80 to 552.57.
The weakness of the lira prompted foreign selling, particularly of
telecommunications issues amid impatience over delays to the privatisation
programme. Stet dipped L5 to L3,735 in heavy volume.
Montedison, L22 ahead at L702, and Ferruzzi, L20.5 higher at L430, found
heavy speculative retail demand.
Toro savings shares succumbed to profit-taking, giving up L386 or 2.8 per
cent to L13,212, after this month's strong rally which followed indications
from Fiat that it was considering disposals in the insurance sector.
MADRID, like other late closing markets, moved up from earlier lows to close
with the general index 0.78 higher at 258.99 on gains in some construction,
utility and industrial stocks. Turnover rose from Pta14.4bn to around
Pta18bn.
VIENNA hit a new 1993 high as the ATX index rose 10.68 to 923.25, up 5.2 per
cent on the week so far. At Kleinwort Benson, Mr Frank Jonuschat said that
fund managers, previously underweight, had been making slight increases in
their exposure to the market over the past six weeks.
