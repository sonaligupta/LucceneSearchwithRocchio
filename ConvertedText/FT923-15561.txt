FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Credit rating


How marketable is a former Maxwell non-executive director? Very, it would
seem, judging by the experiences of Lord Rippon of Hexham, who has just been
elected president of the Institute of Credit Management - replacing Sir
Kenneth Cork, who died last autumn after 26 years as the Institute's
president.
The former Tory cabinet minister went on the board of Maxwell Communication
Corporation in 1986 and resigned at the beginning of this year.
The Institute says the president of Invesco MIM, and former chairman of
Robert Fraser & Partners, inter alia, is an eminent public person, who has
had interests in areas relevant to credit managers.
