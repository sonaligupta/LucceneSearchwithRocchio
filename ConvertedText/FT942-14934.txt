FT  18 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt


   By DAVID WALLER


Following the small interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank last Thursday - a
quarter-point off both the Lombard and the discount rates, taking them to
6.5 and 5.5 per cent respectively - the bund market will this week focus on
the March money supply figures.
As Mr Adolf Rosenstock of the Industrial Bank of Japan in Frankfurt put it,
the chance to cut the whole interest rate salami will depend on the
development of broad money growth in the months ahead.
If the M3 number for March, due to be published later in the week, turns out
at less than 15 per cent, it is likely to be encouraging for the listless
German government securities market.
'Only if the indicator of long-term performance does calm down again - that
is, if M3 does not indicate a preponderant risk of resurgent inflation after
1995 - in conjunction with a strong economic recovery, will the Bundesbank
find scope for lowering rates more,' Rosenstock argues.
The green light will only be given when the trend growth in M3 is back to
around 7 per cent, he says. This would compare with the 4 to 6 per cent
target for the year which was exceeded so dramatically in January and
February, when M3 grew at 21.2 and 17.6 per cent respectively, on an
annualised, seasonally-adjusted basis.
