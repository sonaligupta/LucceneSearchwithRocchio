FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Lloyd's to study Bosporus safety


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


LLOYD'S Register of London has been commissioned by a group of western oil
companies to study shipping safety in the Bosporus.
Lloyd's confirmed it had been commissioned by unnamed US oil concerns to
present findings on environmental and navigational safety by mid-December as
western oil companies expanding in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan seek Turkish
government support for an early decision on the export route. The latest
move is apparently aimed at assuaging Turkish concern at the dangers posed
by the projected increase in tanker traffic.
Separately, a study by Murray & Fenton of London commissioned by the
Turkish-led pipeline consortium concluded that limited increases in tanker
traffic could be accommodated with a new radar system.
The Turkish Transport Ministry has an outstanding tender for a computerised
system, for which Marconi of the UK and Thompson CSF of France have made
proposals.
