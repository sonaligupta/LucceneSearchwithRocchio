FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cranswick shares drop 32p on warning


A WARNING yesterday from the directors of Cranswick that interim profits
would be below their previous expectations sent the company's shares down by
32p to 159p.
Following an 'extremely disappointing' performance from the pig rearing
activities in the second quarter they expected pre-tax profits for the half
year to September 30 to be about Pounds 700,000 compared with Pounds 968,000
previously.
However, the interim dividend was expected to be held at 2.4p when the
results are announced early next month.
The directors blamed the second quarter setback on a 'substantial and
unforeseen fall in pig prices throughout August and September, compounded by
higher feed costs resulting from flooding in the US and a late harvest in
the UK.'
They pointed out that pig prices had continued to fall in October and would
have an impact on that month's profitability.
The group's other activities, grain and feed, 'were continuing to trade
satisfactorily' with most performing ahead of budget.
