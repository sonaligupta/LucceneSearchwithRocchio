FT  28 MAR 92 / US to buy new Russian reactor


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US government yesterday said it would buy a Russian experimental nuclear
reactor designed to power space travel, as part of a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8m)
Russian space technology purchase.
The White House said the Topaz reactor from Moscow's Kurchatov Institute
would give the US access to its technology, which many scientists believe is
not matched by any current US reactors, at a significantly lower cost.
However, for the past 15 months its purchase has been held up the Defence
Department.
The disagreement encapsulates a contentious debate within the US government
over what attitude to adopt towards the space, nuclear and military
industries of the former Soviet Union.
Some argue that the US should buy equipment and services from Russia, both
to obtain new technologies cheaply and to provide gainful employment for
crucial scientists and engineers who might otherwise be tempted to sell
their services elsewhere. Others argue, however, that such purchases
strengthen the Russian military complex through the injection of cash.
