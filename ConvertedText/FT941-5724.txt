FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Anglovaal raises half-year
payout

   JOHANNESBURG


Anglovaal, the South African mining house, is raising its interim dividend
by 6 per cent to 35 cents after benefiting from improved contributions from
its diamond, gold mining and industrial interests in the half-year to
December 31.
Earnings climbed to 270 cents from 252 cents, but 1992 figures have been
restated to reflect last year's change in the company tax rate to 40 per
cent from 48 per cent. Sales rose to R4.82bn (Dollars 1.4bn) from R4.3bn,
with operating income at R406.2m compared with R344.8m. Lower investment
receipts curbed the rise in pre-tax profit to 16 per cent to R429.7m.
Solid performances from Anglovaal Industries' cement, engineering and
textiles businesses ensured the mining house's industrial interests remained
the mainstay of group profitability.
After-tax profit climbed to R283.9m from R242.9m with a drop in the group's
effective tax rate. A sharp fall in equity accounted earnings left net
income only 7 per cent higher at R162.9m against R152m.
