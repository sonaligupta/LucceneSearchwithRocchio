FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&A: Transfer of capital


I AM British but my wife is an American citizen who is resident in the UK
paying British income tax.
I have heard that, should one of us die, any transfer of capital between us
is not tax-exempt as in the normal case between husband and wife.
I have the following main assets as a result of death: endowments;
life-linked savings policies and term life policies (Pounds 250,000); life
assurance from company pension (Pounds 160,000); house in joint names
(Pounds 160,000); and a mortgage in our joint names (Pounds 120,000).
My wife has the following assets in the case of death: term life policy
(Pounds 130,000), life assurance from company pension (Pounds 120,000);
other joint assets/savings (Pounds 40,000).
Am I correct in assuming that we could suffer inheritance tax if either of
us died, and is there a simple solution to avoid any such exposure?
The inheritance tax legislation provides that where a deceased person's
property passes to his or her spouse, and that the deceased (but not the
deceased's spouse) is domiciled in the United Kingdom, then the transfer is
exempt only up to a value of Pounds 55,000. Any value transferred in excess
will be liable to inheritance tax.
This rule might apply if you die and your property passes to your wife - but
it does depend upon her domicile and not on her residence or citizenship.
If your wife were to die before you, it appears that any UK property which
she owned and which passed to you would be covered by the inter-spousal
exemption.
