FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures had a ragged day, barely ticking over for the most of
the session in low trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,073 at the official 4.10pm close, up
three points. At this level the premium to the cash market was around 10
points, and the fair value premium 15 points.
Contract numbers were sharply lower at 10,119, down from 12,822 on
Wednesday. This reduces the average volume for the week so far to little
more than 12,000 lots.
The average size of deals is said to have shrunk dramatically as dealers
keep a tight rein on their books in what traders describe as the complete
absence of feel over direction.
There was a smattering of institutional business but for the most part the
game was left to the local, independent traders. There was little serious
pressure one way or the other on the cash market.
The premium to cash equities at the close was about as narrow as it had been
all day.
Stock option turnover was 39,643 lots, broadly in line with the 39,813
registered in the previous session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted
for 27,000 contracts.
Guinness was the busiest individual stock option with 1,550 lots dealt. BP
(1,243 lots) and HSBC (1,160) were also actively traded.
