FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Strong Digital result lifts
shares

DIGITAL Equipment's share price rose sharply yesterday on news of strong
third-quarter earnings as the US computer company continues to reduce its
workforce and realign operations.
Digital reported net income of Dollars 116.6m, or 94 cents, for the quarter,
up dramatically from Dollars 24.9m or 20 cents in the third quarter last
year. Revenues rose 8 per cent to Dollars 3.52bn from Dollars 3.26bn.
The quarter's results reflect the consolidation of earnings from
Digital-Kienzle, a German computer company in which Digital acquired a 65
per cent interest from Mannesmann for Dollars 230m last December. Before the
Kienzle consolidation, earnings per share were Dollars 1.14.
In response to the third-quarter results, Digital's share price rose sharply
in heavy trading to close Dollars 3 1/8 higher at Dollars 69 3/4 .
For the first nine months of 1991 the company reported revenues of Dollars
9.96bn, up 4 per cent from Dollars 9.58bn in the same period a year ago.
Net income for the nine months was down, however to Dollars 253.9m from
Dollars 331.1m. Earnings per share were Dollars 2.06, compared with Dollars
2.65 per share a year ago.
'The difficult economic environment of the past several quarters is still
with us,' said Mr John Smith, senior vice-president of operations.
'The uncertain business outlook, which was heightened by the Middle East
conflict, is resulting in delays in customers' investments in technology,
particularly for large systems.'
'We have made good progress in our programme of lowering expenses,
consolidating our facilities and restructuring our workforce,' added Mr
Smith.
During the quarter more than 2,200 employees left Digital, he said.
Worldwide service revenues from systems integration and other activities
grew by 20 per cent during the quarter, said Mr Kenneth Olsen, Digital's
president.
Sales of its Unix workstations have doubled since the same period last year,
but those of the high-end minicomputers were hit by economic conditions, the
company said.
