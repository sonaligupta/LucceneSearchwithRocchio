FT  23 NOV 92 / Fujimori appears to win clear majority

PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori appeared last night to have won an absolute
majority in Peru's new 'democratic constituent congress', according to exit
polls published by the Lima-based opinion research organisation, Apoyo, as
voting closed.
The official party formed from his own Cambio (Change) 90 party and New
Majority, a group of independents which includes several former cabinet
ministers, is expected to take 44 of the 80 seats. The Popular Christian
party took second place with about eight, followed by the Independent
Moralising Front and Renovation.
The 18-member congress will replace the two-chamber parliament dissolved by
Mr Fujimori on April 5. It is charged with writing a new constitution, as
well as fulfilling legislative and watchdog functions, and is expected to
satisfy international demands for a return to formal democracy.
Polling stations were under heavy military guard and security around the
capital was tight. Early morning voting was light and polling was extended
for 90 minutes to allow as many as possible of the 11m electorate to cast
their votes.
The electoral process, monitored nationwide by a team of 200 observers from
the Organisation of American States, appeared to have been orderly. There
were no reports of violence despite earlier fears that Sendero Luminoso
guerrillas had planned to disrupt voting.
Peru's two largest traditional political parties boycotted the elections.
They claim the new congress will be reduced to rubber-stamping decisions
taken by the executive branch.
