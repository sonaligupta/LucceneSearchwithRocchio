FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Hodder Headline jumps to Pounds 2.05m


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Hodder Headline yesterday announced a large profits rise in its first
interim figures to include results of Hodder & Stoughton acquired last year.
Sales quadrupled to Pounds 33.4m (Pounds 8.3m) and pre-tax profit more than
trebled to Pounds 2.05m in the first six months of 1994, against Pounds
570,000 last time.
The results were accompanied by the announcement that Mr Tim Hely
Hutchinson, chief executive, had decided to leave the net book agreement
that sets minimum prices for most books in the UK. From Christmas
booksellers will be free to discount Hodder Headline titles if they want to
do so.
Mr Hely Hutchinson said the results 'look particularly strong viewed with
the background of flat UK trading conditions and the very substantial
reorganisation we have been completing.'
The company said the post-merger reorganisation was now largely complete and
Hodder, which plans to publish more than 2,000 titles in 1995 compared with
1,700 this year, is looking for expansion and acquisitions that will enhance
earnings.
The company is interested in increasing the size of its reference, schools
and childrens' publishing operations.
If the company is unable to make a significant acquisition in the next year,
Mr Hely Hutchinson said yesterday: 'I think I would be very disappointed.'
Earnings per share rose by 41 per cent to 3.8p (2.7p) and the interim
dividend increased to 2p (1.65p).
Mr Hely Hutchinson said he looked forward to a 'good second half' and
analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 8m for the full year.
Lord Donoughmore, Hodder's chairman and Mr Hely Hutchinson's father, also
revealed that from May it had ceased to recognise trade unions.
'The board does not believe trade unions have a useful role to play in the
group,' Lord Donoughmore said.
