The first quarter of 1994 for the Anglo-American pharmaceuticals group is
the last quarter at the helm for chief executive Bob Bauman. It may also be
the best quarter of the year as the US patent on ulcer drug Tagamet expires
next month. First quarter pre-tax profits should be Pounds 347m, a rise of
13 per cent on past year's first quarter, according to Andrew Porter at
securities house UBS. The dividend, watched by sector investors after the
sharp rise in Glaxo's payout earlier this year, should be 2.76p, up 9 per
cent, for the quarter.
