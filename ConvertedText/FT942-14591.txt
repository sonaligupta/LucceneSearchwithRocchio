FT  20 APR 94 / Greek tax sparks protests: European News Digest

Greece's Socialist government, facing a widening budget deficit, yesterday
introduced a 15 per cent tax on earnings from repos - fixed-term repurchase
agreements - in a last-minute amendment to fiscal legislation. The fiscal
package is due to be voted through parliament this week. It includes a
controversial 15 per cent tax on dividends from mutual funds' investments in
government securities. The measure triggered protests from fund managers
because interest on government bonds otherwise remains tax-free. With growth
in tax revenues running at around 12 per cent for the first quarter, against
a target of 22 per cent, the government is trying to boost income from other
sources. Projections by private sector economists indicate the government
borrowing requirement will rise to 17 per cent of gross domestic product
this year, against a target of 12.8 per cent.
