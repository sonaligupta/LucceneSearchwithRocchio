FT  05 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Turkey to revive high-speed rail plan


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ISTANBUL


TURKEY is to revive plans for a high-speed rail link between Istanbul and
Ankara, inviting tenders for a project started in 1979 but shelved for lack
of finance.
The scheme, estimated to cost TL30,000bn (Pounds 2.2bn), is for a
twin-track, 430km rail link. It will include a tube tunnel crossing the
Bosporus (which divides European and Asian Turkey and is 600 metres at its
narrowest point). The project will cut travel time from eight hours to just
over two. Bids for design and construction must be in by September 15.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkey's premier, first mentioned the rail scheme
during French President Francois Mitterrand's visit earlier this year. He
urged foreign companies to join Turkish groups in rebuilding the Silk Route
to Central Asia. Mr Bruno Durieux, France's junior trade minister, expressed
interest in the rail and tunnel project when visiting Turkey two weeks ago.
Interest from the UK is expected from Costains and Trafalgar House.
