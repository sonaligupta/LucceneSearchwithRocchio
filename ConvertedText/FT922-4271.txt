FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Reuters settles Australian tax claim out of
court


   By MAGGIE URRY


REUTERS HOLDINGS, the international news agency, said yesterday it had
settled out of court a claim from the Australian Tax Office at ADollars 59m
(Pounds 24.7m), well below the ADollars 164.5m the ATO had demanded. The
payment will be treated as an extraordinary item.
The claim arose when Reuters took over Australian Associated Press, a
company which had earlier sold some Reuters shares when the company was
floated in 1984 and swapped some for new Reuters shares. It sold some of
these in 1986.
Reuters bought a 48.8 per cent stake in AAP, whose only significant asset
was its Reuters shares, in 1988 and acquired the rest of the company in
1989. In 1990 the ATO decided that the gain made on the share sale should be
liable to income tax and put in its claim.
Reuters had disclosed the claim as a contingent liability in its last three
sets of accounts.
The dispute was due to come to court next week but the ATO then offered to
settle. Reuters said its lawyers advised that the settlement was reasonable.
Reuters shares fell 21p to Pounds 11.79.
