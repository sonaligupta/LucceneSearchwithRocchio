FT  13 MAR 93 / Business body angry at 'snub'


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


THE GOVERNMENT was acc-used yesterday of snubbing Britain's largest
small-business organisation by failing to send a minister to the annual
conference of the Federation of Small Businesses.
The 58,000-member federation said this was the first time in many years that
a minister had not attended its conference in Bournemouth, which ends
tomorrow. Three hundred delegates have attended for debates on subjects such
as the recession, the role of small businesses in economic recovery, the
Maastricht treaty and the Budget.
'It is a snub,' said Mr Ian Handford, chairman of the federation's policy
unit. 'It confirms our view that the government is paying lip service when
it comes to practical policies for small firms.
'We have more members than the CBI and the Institute of Directors put
together and we feel a minister should have been here to listen to our
views.'
The federation said it had asked Mr John Major to attend, but the invitation
had been passed on to Baroness Denton, small firms minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry. They finally invited Mr Bill Cash, a Tory
Euro-rebel MP, who accepted an invitation to talk about the Maastricht
treaty.
The DTI said the invitation had reached Baroness Denton only a month ago and
she could not change her programme, which involved visits to Devon and
Cornwall.
