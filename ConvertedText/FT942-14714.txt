FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 12% in first quarter


   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent


Waste Management International, the environmental services group, saw first
quarter pre-tax profits rise by 12.4 per cent to Pounds 38.7m, despite
northern Europe's slowness in recovering from recession.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said that volumes in northern Europe in
January and February had been below expectations, partly because of bad
weather, but that the group was 'roughly on target for the full year'.
Price increases in the UK, Italy, France and Latin America accounted for
nearly a fifth of the 16 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 256m (Pounds
220.9m).
The group's formidable rate of acquisition - 48 deals in 1993 - also pushed
up turnover by 9 percentage points. However WMI, which is the UK quoted arm
of WMX Technologies of the US, said that currency movements cut turnover by
some Pounds 11m.
Italy, one of last year's main disappointments, contributed less than 30 per
cent of turnover in the first quarter.
Cost cutting, particularly in the UK, allowed operating profits to rise by
22 per cent to Pounds 41.9m (Pounds 34.3m), but an increase in net interest
payable held back pre-tax profits.
Tax planning as well as a larger contribution from low-tax regions such as
Hong Kong pulled the rate down to 26.1 per cent (28.4 per cent).
WMI expects the tax rate for the full year to be bet-ween 26 per cent and 27
per cent.
Improvement at Hong Kong and UK acquisitions accounted for the sharp leap to
Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 1.8m) in payments to minority interests. That held the
rise in earnings per share to 6.4p (6.1p).
Mr Falkman said: 'we continue to look at making strategic acquisitions,
particularly in Germany and the UK. The weak economic conditions create good
acquisition opportunities'.
