FT  10 JAN 92 / Bundesbank assailed over high interest rates

   BERLIN, FRANKFURT, BONN


THE Bundesbank's policy of high interest rates could bring economic disaster
to east Germany, leading economists warned yesterday. Mr Lutz Hoffmann,
president of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin,
said a strangling of Germany's economic growth by high interest rates could
cause an expected economic upswing in east Germany to collapse.
Mr Heiner Flassbeck, also of DIW, accused the Bundesbank of following a
monetary policy which amounted to 'recession'.
He recommended that the central bank adhere to a steady expansion of the
money supply of between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent instead of between 3.5
per cent and 5.5 per cent.
Christopher Parkes adds from Bonn: Around 500,000 people will join German
dole queues this year, according to Mr Heinrich Franke, head of the federal
labour office. By mid-year there would be 1.35m unemployed in the east,
about 400,000 more than at the same time last year. Numbers in the west, hit
by the economic slowdown, would rise by 100,000.
The tightening labour market and looming recession are having some effect on
this year's pay negotiations. Steel workers, offered a 4.54 per cent
two-stage pay rise in talks on Wednesday night, dropped strike threats and
agreed to resume talks.
