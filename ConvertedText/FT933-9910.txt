CPC International, the US food company whose brands range from Knorr soups
to Hellman's mayonnaise, is buying an 85 per cent interest in Pfanni-Werke
Otto Eckart, a German potato products producer, for an undisclosed sum,
writes Nikki Tait.
Pfanni makes a range of potato-based goods. The company has three plants in
Germany and one in Poland, and annual sales stand at about Dollars 220m.
Some of the products are also exported to the US, where they are sold under
the Pfanni name.
CPC said yesterday it saw considerable scope for extending the Pfanni brand,
and expected to develop the business 'aggressively'.
RJR Nabisco Holdings is expected to issue 30m shares of Dollars 25 Series B
cumulative preferred stock totalling Dollars 750m next week, according to
underwriter Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Reuter reports from New York.
Merrill Lynch said the expected price for the preferred stock offering was 9
1/4 per cent.
The issue is rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB-plus by Standard
and Poor's, the international ratings agencies.
Net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock offering will be used for
general corporate purposes, RJR said.
RJR Nabisco Holdings currently has about Dollars 14bn of debt outstanding
from the Dollars 29bn of debt incurred in the biggest leveraged buy-out ever
in 1989.
CAE, the Canadian flight-simulator builder, recorded first quarter profit of
CDollars 7.6m (USDollars 5.9m), or 7 cents a share, up 34 per cent from
CDollars 5.7m, or 5 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 253m,
against CDollars 240m, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The group said the
commercial aircraft simulator and defence markets remained weak.
