FT  12 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report


   By REUTER


GOLD'S bounce from Wednesday's lows continued with an afternoon fix at
Dollars 326.90 a troy ounce, up 25 cents, as the market tested prices over
Dollars 327. The market took some strength from the firmer tone in platinum
group metals and silver and found further support from commission house
buying, traders said. The tone generally reflected optimism that having
resisted a drop through Dollars 326 overnight, a move back to Dollars 328
could be maintained. Even so, rand and Australian dollar equivalent prices
remain attractive to producers and selling will slow the recovery.
Three-month COPPER pushed above resistance around Dollars 2,170 a tonne on
the London Metal Exchange, helped by steadier levels in New York, although
there appeared to be stiff resistance developing near Dollars 2,180, an old
support level. Dealers said the sluggish European market is being offset by
a positive Comex, with US physical demand said to be in good shape and the
LME arbitrage premium narrowing.
