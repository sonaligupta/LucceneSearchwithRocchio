FT  28 JAN 94 / Scott to hear QC's evidence in private


   By JIMMY BURNS


Lord Justice Scott has decided to hear evidence in private from an important
witness on the issue of disclosure of government documents.
The judge said yesterday that he would take oral evidence from Mr Andrew
Collins QC in private next Wednesday to avoid doing anything that could
prejudice a possible re-trial of four businessmen convicted in 1992 of
illegally exporting arms to Iraq.
Mr Collins is counsel for Customs and Excise in a pending appeal by the
businessmen, who were involved with the Reading-based company Ordinance
Technology. The Ordtech case involved the use of public interest immunity
certificates by ministers to withhold Whitehall documents of relevance to
the defence, as in the Matrix-Churchill trial. The businessmen are appealing
against conviction on the grounds that the government knew one defendant was
working for the intelligence services and that the arms sold to Iraq were
being routed via Jordan.
Lord Justice Scott could still bring Mr Collins' evidence to the attention
of the Court of the Appeal 'in the interests of justice'.
