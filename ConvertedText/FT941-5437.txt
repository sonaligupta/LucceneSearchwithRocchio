FT  07 MAR 94 / O'Reilly to urge curbs on MGN bid


   By RAYMOND SNODDY and TIM BURT


Mr Tony O'Reilly's Independent Newspapers of Ireland will today urge Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to impose strict conditions
on the takeover bid for The Independent newspaper by a consortium which
includes Mirror Group Newspapers.
However the Irish group, which holds 29.9 per cent of Newspaper Publishing,
the company that owns both The Independent and the Independent on Sunday,
will not push for a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission when
it gives evidence to the DTI today.
There is growing concern at the financial state of The Independent, which
could lose between Pounds 10m and Pounds 12m this year, and at the
realisation that an MMC investigation would increase the period of
uncertainty.
Mr O'Reilly's team will argue that three main conditions should be imposed:
An independent board should be set up which would include the Irish group as
the single largest shareholder.
The DTI should look again at change to shareholding structure. The main
shareholders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, could sell their
shares to MGN or vice versa if there was a failure to agree a business plan.
There should be a transparent agreement on provision of services such as
printing. Under the agreement with the consortium, MGN will provide services
to Newspaper Publishing, apart from editorial, until 1999.
Meanwhile a number of MPs are expressing concern about the future of The
Independent, particularly over issues of editorial independence. Mr Peter
Mandelson, Labour MP for Hartlepool, said that the Labour party should argue
for a reference to the MMC even though the Daily Mirror was 'a friend'.
