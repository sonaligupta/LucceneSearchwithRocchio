FT  14 APR 94 / Council of Europe chief elected


   By DAVID BUCHAN

The 32-nation Council of Europe has elected a Russian-speaking Swede to be
its new secretary general, at a time when the biggest political problem
facing Europe's premier human rights organisation is how to respond to
Russia's application to join. Mr Daniel Tarschys, a 50-year-old former
Swedish conservative MP, was elected on Tuesday, beating Mrs Catherine
Lalumiere, a French socialist who has been secretary general for the past
five years. Behind Mr Tarschys' success was said to be the belief that the
Council needed the Swede's Russian expertise in gauging how to respond to
the membership applications that have been filed by Russia, as well as
Belarus and the Ukraine.
