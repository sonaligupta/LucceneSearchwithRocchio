FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Shandwick in the black but omits pay-out


   By ANDREW BOLGER


SHANDWICK, one of the world's biggest public relations companies, is passing
its interim dividend in spite of returning to the black in the six months to
April 30.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.54m were well down on the Pounds 8.12m made in
the six months to January 1991, the nearest comparable period after a change
in year-end.
However, they are a considerable improvement on the plunge into losses of
Pounds 1.44m for the 15 months to last October.
When those losses were flagged in December, Shandwick's share price dropped
from 125p to 52 1/2 p. Yesterday they closed 1p lower at 11p, valuing the
group at less than Pounds 10m.
Turnover was Pounds 79.1m (Pounds 75.6m). Profits were struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 309,000, relating to part of the costs of
refinancing earlier this year, and interest payments of Pounds 2.81m (Pounds
2m). The full refinancing costs of Pounds 1.7m will be taken as an
exceptional charge at the end of the current year.
Mr Peter Gummer, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The economic
conditions in which our clients trade throughout the world remain extremely
poor and show little or no sign of improvement.'
The group has negotiated banking facilities totalling Pounds 65m until next
March, which it said were sufficient for forecasted needs. At April 30 net
debt stood at Pounds 58.3m, an increase of Pounds 9m in the half-year. Net
debt is expected to peak at Pounds 60m by the year-end, and to decrease
thereafter.
The group has a Pounds 987,000 loan outstanding to its Employee Share
Ownership Plan, secured by shares which are currently worth only Pounds
109,000. The board said it would review the need for any write-down on this
loan at the year-end.
Shandwick, which grew rapidly through acquisitions in the 1980s, made
acquisition-related payments of Pounds 6.2m in the half-year, with a further
Pounds 2m payable in the second half.
Staff numbers have been reduced by 15 per cent from more than 2,200 in
January last year to 1,870 at present.
The group said it had been profitable, after central costs and interest,
every month since last December.
Although, for the first time in its history, operating income declined
slightly, the resilience of the income stream was in large part because some
70 per cent of fees came from existing clients.
Earnings for the period were 0.9p (6.4p) per share.
