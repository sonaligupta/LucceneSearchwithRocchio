FT  30 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK equities


The whirring cogs of the UK economy emitted some discordant noises this
week, but they were drowned out on the equity and bond markets by the shouts
of 'buy' orders down telephones. The CBI's quarterly industrial trends
suggesting the UK recovery was faltering as a result of recession in
mainland Europe caused only a momentary flutter of concern. Anxieties about
the outlook for corporate earnings were also shrugged off. Since the
beginning of October, NatWest Securities' analysts have downgraded their
earnings forecasts for 18 companies while upgrading only five. The market
worries not a jot.
The benign interpretation is that such anxieties matter very little, given
the trend in global interest rates. Indeed, even bad economic news, such as
the CBI survey, is seen as encouraging because it only makes more certain
further interest rate cuts. Moreover, if the UK really has tamed its
inflation problem, 10-year gilts yielding 6.7 per cent continue to look
cheap against the 5.8 per cent obtainable on German bunds. Such logic may
well underpin a further run in UK equities and bonds. But in a European
context, the UK will steadily lose its charms when compared with continental
markets. Investors may switch into France and Germany, where real interest
rates remain high and the economic cycle has not yet swung upwards.
