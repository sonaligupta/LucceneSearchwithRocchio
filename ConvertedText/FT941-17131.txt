FT  06 JAN 94 / Foreigners believe London is a safe city


   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent


Foreign visitors to London regard it as a safe and clean city, although some
see it as too expensive, according to research carried out for the British
Tourist Authority.
Interviews with 1,210 foreign visitors to London last summer found that only
1 per cent were worried about their personal safety in the city.
This contrasts strongly with research carried out last year which indicated
that a large number of UK residents regarded London as a dangerous city to
visit. The research by Lunn Poly, the travel agents' chain, found that more
than 70 per cent of UK residents surveyed thought it was more dangerous to
visit London than travel abroad.
Litter, another common complaint by Londoners and UK visitors, was mentioned
as a problem by only 2 per cent in the authority's survey.
More than 40 per cent of the foreign visitors said they had experienced no
problems, but of the 57 per cent who had problems, 15 per cent thought
London was expensive.
Asked what they saw as London's attractions, 69 per cent mentioned the
city's heritage.
