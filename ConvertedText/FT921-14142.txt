FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Lookers halved to Pounds 3.21m as new
vehicle sales decline


   By JANE FULLER


MOTOR DEALERS are looking for a helping hand from the Budget rather than the
blows inflicted by the government last year in terms of company car taxation
and VAT, according to Mr Ken Martindale, chairman of Lookers.
Pre-tax profits fell 50 per cent to Pounds 3.21m (Pounds 6.45m) in the year
to September 30 as the Manchester-based dealer suffered along with others in
the sector from a drop in new car sales from nearly 2m in 1990 to 1.59m last
year.
Mr Martindale said: 'There will be a recovery because replacement decisions
have been deferred. But it depends on the Budget.
'The government might reduce car tax, and it might not have the carelessness
to increase company car tax and VAT, as it did last year after 15 months of
falling sales.' He reckoned that new car sales might recover to between
1.65m and 1.7m this year.
Operating profit fell 22 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 14.2m) on turnover
of Pounds 359.6m (Pounds 370.5m). Interest costs rose to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds
7.71m).
The group incurred a retained loss of nearly Pounds 800,000. Mr Martindale
said this was roughly equal to the provision made for deferred taxation
following a decision to reduce contract hire.
About Pounds 25m of the group's net debt of Pounds 45m - gearing of 115 per
cent - was related to contract hire. 'Debt is a dirty word at the moment,'
he said. Gearing would be reduced particularly in 1992-93 and the year
after.
The main reason for the profit fall was motor distribution, including
contract hire, which contributed Pounds 5.27m after interest but before head
office costs.
The group's leading franchises are Vauxhall and Rover. A recent development
is the opening of three Nissan dealerships.
New car sales were down in numbers and margin; used cars were up on both
counts. Servicing and parts advanced and accounted for 70 per cent of group
profits, he said.
Conditions were worst in the south-east and Mr Martindale admitted that
expansion there could have been better timed - it paid Pounds 14m, mainly in
convertible preference shares, for SMAC in the summer of 1989.
Profit from caravans - mainly holiday parks - slipped to Pounds 427,000 and
the loss on agricultural equipment grew to Pounds 415,000.
Property gains of Pounds 513,000 (Pounds 408,000) were taken above the line.
Although earnings per share slid to 2.1p (16.8p), the final dividend is held
at 4.2p for a maintained total of 6.2p.
