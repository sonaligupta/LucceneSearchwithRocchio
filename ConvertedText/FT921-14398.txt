FT  16 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Gilts head leaves Salomon
Brothers


   By SARAH WEBB


MR SIMON THORP, the head of gilt-edged securities trading at Salomon
Brothers International in London, left the company yesterday, writes Sarah
Webb.
The company said Mr Thorp has been replaced by Mr Andrew Duthie and Mr Robie
Yuniacke. They will act as joint heads of the gilts trading desk. No reason
was given for Mr Thorp's departure.
Salomon Brothers, a market-maker in gilt-edged securities, made a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 8.38m in 1990 on gilt operations with a capital base of
Pounds 59m at the end of that year.
Salomon Brothers has been hit by a wave of staff departures - both enforced
and voluntary - in recent weeks. Most of these, however, have been on the
equity side. However, on the fixed income side, Mr Simon Meadows, the firm's
head of bond syndication, resigned last week to join Credit Suisse First
Boston as co-head of debt syndication.
