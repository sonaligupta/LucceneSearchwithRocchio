FT  28 APR 94 / Cyprus hopes fade


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   Istanbul


Hopes of a breakthrough on Cyprus appeared to recede yesterday with Turkey's
parliament postponing today's debate on United Nations' confidence building
measures to end the 20-year division of the island. The rescheduling of the
debate to Tuesday is a snub to prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller, who has
urged the Turkish Cypriots to agree the package, warning that Cyprus was an
increasing handicap for Turkey. She was openly attacked by Turkish
politicians, and less explicitly, by Mr Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot
leader. A UN special envoy has been in an intense diplomatic shuttle between
Turkey and the island this week in a bid to sell plans to re-open Nicosia
airport for use by both communities, and to allow Greeks to return to the
resort of Varosha, under a UN administration.
