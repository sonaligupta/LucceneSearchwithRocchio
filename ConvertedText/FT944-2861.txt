Lumpur surges 4.1%

Equities moved ahead slightly in a technical correction to Tuesday's
decline, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average improved 56.01 to 18,931.49 in volume estimated at
220m shares, little changed from the previous day's 218.65m. The index moved
narrowly between 18,957.59 and 18,887.68 during the day.
The first-section Topix index edged up 0.37 to 1,498.04, while the
capital-weighted Nikkei 300 firmed 0.30 to 276.79. Falls outnumbered rises
by 524 to 415, with 226 issues flat and 73 stocks at their lows for the
year. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.01 at 1,248.66.
The market enjoyed early gains on a combination of arbitrage buying due to
steadiness in Chicago futures overnight and buy orders placed by one life
insurance company. A sharp rebound in the Hong Kong market softened
otherwise bearish sentiment that prevailed throughout the day.
Manufacturers of semiconductor production equipment were mostly firmer on
reports of sharply higher earnings for four leading companies in the year to
March 31. Advantest, Kokusai Electric and Tokyo Electron all edged up Y10 to
Y3,200, Y1,820, and Y3,030 respectively. Nikon receded Y8 to Y908.
Higher prices for cotton yarns gave textiles a boost. Nitto Boseki added Y8
at Y270 and Toyobo Y5 at Y382.
Major steel producers were lifted by foreign repurchasing and institutional
buying. One-half of the day's 10 most active stocks were steel groups:
Nippon Steel rose Y8 to Y357, its first gain in five trading days, Sumitomo
Metal ticked up Y1 to Y308, Kobe Steel firmed Y3 to Y303 and Kawasaki Steel
put on Y4 at Y397. But NKK, the day's volume leader, was off Y1 at Y264.
After four consecutive losing days, Japan Tobacco retrieved Y1,000 at
Y907,000, but most traders agreed that the stock had yet to show evidence of
bottoming. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y5,000 at Y838,000.
East Japan Railway dipped Y2,000 to Y469,000, while Odakyu Electric Rail
held at Y707 in the day's fourth highest volume of 3.5m shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average edged down 19.20 to 20,738.49 in volume of 74.2m
shares.

Renewed strength was seen in some Pacific Rim markets.
