FT  13 NOV 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Memo card that takes dictation


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


Why do the best ideas always emerge when you're in the bath or driving along
the motorway, with no scrap of paper at hand to jot them down?
With this in mind, Creative Technologies Marketing, of Douglas, Isle of Man,
has developed a voice memo card, the size of a credit card, which can be
used for recording phone numbers, messages or simply transient thoughts.
Four buttons on the surface enable the owner to record, stop, erase or play
back the messages.
The card, which can be kept in a pocket or on the dashboard of a car, uses
chip from Texas Instruments to record up to 24 seconds of personal memos,
which should hold up to about six messages. The voice memo card will retail
at Pounds 24.95 from December. Creative Technologies Marketing: UK, 071 266
