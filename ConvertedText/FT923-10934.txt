FT  28 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Honey side blamed for 14% fall at Merrydown


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


MERRYDOWN WINE, the USM-quoted cider, wine and health foods group, reported
a 14 per cent decline, from Pounds 2.24m to Pounds 1.93m, in annual profits
before tax.
Its premium cider brands weathered the recession with strong sales growth
through supermarkets and off-licences but its honey business was badly hit,
according to Mr Richard Purdey, chairman.
The outcome for the year to March 31 was also affected by a 45 per cent
increase to Pounds 425,000 in interest charges and higher British apple
prices.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 2.53m to Pounds 2.35m on turnover up 3
per cent at Pounds 17.3m.
First quarter sales of the group's key brands were ahead of last year
despite increased competition and difficult economic conditions, Mr Purdey
said.
Merrydown Vintage cider had maintained its position as the leading premium
brand and was the best-selling packaged cider in Scotland. Merrydown
Traditional, launched in January last year, had secured 5 per cent of the
growing can sector; and Premium Draught, the group's first keg cider, would
be given wider distribution through a partnership to be announced shortly.
Reorganisation of West Country Honey Farms under a new managing director had
been completed, and the company would now compete in the mainstream honey
market as well as building its specialist preserves business. 'I am
confident we shall see a return to former levels of profitability,' Mr
Purdey said.
Group export sales increased 13.4 per cent to Pounds 760,000.
Earnings were reduced from 20.61p to 17.15p but the total dividend is raised
an effective 12.5 per cent to 7p with a final of 6p; as in the previous
year, there is a 1-for-8 scrip issue.
