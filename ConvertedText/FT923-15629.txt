FT  01 JUL 92 / Thatcher sworn in at Lords


DEMURE and self-effacing on what she conceded was 'a very nervy occasion',
former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher kept her cool as she was sworn
in as Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven in the House of Lords yesterday.
The Lords' scarlet benches were as packed as for the Queen's formal opening
of parliament. In the front row of the opposition benches, two other former
prime ministers, Lord Wilson and Lord Callaghan, looked on.
