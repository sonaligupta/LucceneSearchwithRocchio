FT  08 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Second tier currencies make all the running


   By PHILIP GAWITH


Second tier currencies made the running yesterday on the foreign exchanges,
with most of the main currencies rangebound, writes Philip Gawith.
Following last week's intervention by the US Federal Reserve, traders said
the market was taking a 'wait and see' attitude to the dollar ahead of the
November 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.
It closed slightly weaker in London, from last Friday, at DM1.5172 from
DM1.5235, and at Y97.31 from Y97.8. In New York it ended at DM1.5170 and
Y97.345. Trade was generally very quiet, a fact partially substantiated by
Bank of Japan figures showing dollar/yen spot turnover in Tokyo yesterday as
the lowest, at Dollars 2.172bn, in 15 months.
Currencies in the news included the Swedish krona, which weakened on fears
of a vote against joining the European Union; the Portuguese escudo, which
broke through the Es102 level against the D-Mark; and the Australian and New
Zealand dollars, which both continued their recent appreciation.
The trade weighted sterling index was unchanged at 80.6. In Europe the
D-Mark closed slightly weaker against most currencies. Against the French
franc it finished at FFr3.427 from FFr3.431.
Last week's intervention by the Fed in support of the dollar has made
traders wary of selling it. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist
at UBS in London, commented: 'People are just waiting to see what happens
next with the Fed. They are not prepared to take a big punt.'
Speaking after a meeting in Basle of the G10 central bank governors
committee, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, chairman, and also president of the
Bundesbank, said intervention had been discussed. He said 'things were done
appropriately and it was seen positively' but gave no hint of what lay
ahead.
Mr Malcolm Barr, analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said a measure of how
quiet trade had been was that the Dollars /DM trading range, in Europe, of
about 70 basis points was about half the average daily range of 120 to 130
basis points.
Mr Brian Marber, technical analyst, still maintained that the dollar's long
term trend is down. He noted that at its recent low against the D-Mark it
had only fallen 15.2 per cent, against the 24.4 to 29.9 per cent swings in
all five 'major moves' since December 1987.
The charts also have a potentially gloomy message for sterling. While not
calling a reversal, Mr Marber pointed out that between 1985 and March 1994
there were seven occasions when the pound rose for periods of 20 to 26 weeks
without any significant reaction intervening. From the March 1994 low to
last month's peak, 29 weeks elapsed, the longest run since 1985, during
which sterling gained nearly 18 cents.
After the seven previous multi-week advances, sterling lost an average of 59
per cent of its gains, on two occasions surrendering 100 per cent and more.
Were it to lose 59 per cent of the rise made since March, it would fall to
Dollars 1.5335.
The pound gained limited support from the unexpectedly strong UK output
figures. September industrial output rose by 1.1 per cent, for a
year-on-year gain of 6.6 per cent.
Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-Amro, said there was still
some nervousness in sterling markets about a near-term rise in UK interest
rates. He added that the strong production figures had improved the prospect
of interest rates rising this year, though he still favoured early 1995 for
the next tightening.
The prospect of higher rates prompted a fall in short sterling, with the
December contract closing at 93.56, from 93.60. In the cash markets,
three-month LIBOR firmed to 6 3/16 per cent, from 6 1/16 per cent.
In its daily operations the Bank of England gave Pounds 490m assistance at
established rates, and Pounds 585m of late support, after forecasting a
Pounds 1.2bn shortage. Overnight money traded between 5 5/8 and 6 1/2 per
cent.
The Swedish krona continued to take its lead from EU opinion polls. A
weekend poll showing more opposition to, than support for, EU membership,
drove the krona as low as SKr4.8675 per D-Mark, before it rallied to end at
SKr4.843.
Elsewhere, the Australian dollar was firm, rising to Dollars 0.7539 from
Dollars 0.7484. Analysts said it was benefiting from the market perception
that the Reserve Bank had acted pre-emptively to combat inflation.
