FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Invergordon exceeds forecast


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


INVERGORDON Distillers, the Scotch whisky group, reported a 42 per cent
increase in 1991 pre-tax profits, comfortably exceeding the forecast made
during its successful resistance to the Pounds 350m bid by Whyte & Mackay,
the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands.
Profits rose from Pounds 22.7m to Pounds 32.2m. Earnings per share jumped to
16.8p (12.1p) and a proposed final dividend of 4p raises the total to 6.5p
(5p).
The takeover battle, which left Whyte & Mackay with a 41.3 per cent stake,
cost Invergordon Pounds 4.2m, taken as an extraordinary item.
Operating profits increased by 18 per cent, from Pounds 31m to Pounds 36.7m,
on turnover ahead to Pounds 92.4m (Pounds 90.7m). Margins improved more than
5 percentage points to 39.7 per cent.
Mr Chris Greig, managing director, said there had been significant changes
in the mix of business.
Exports rose 6 per cent by volume and 4 per cent in value. Bulk shipments of
whisky declined 14 per cent but sales of higher margin bottled-in-Scotland
brands showed a commensurate rise.
In the UK, where whisky volumes declined overall by 7 per cent, sales of the
group's bottled own-label products increased by 14 per cent in volume and 24
per cent in value.
COMMENT
The results justified the judgment of majority shareholders who stuck with
the management. Maximum benefit has been extracted from a small rise in
turnover amid difficult trading conditions through tight cost controls,
increasing use of stocks of mature whiskies and continuing conversion of
bulk to bottled sales. Recession even proved helpful, polarising the market
between premium brands and Invergordon's own-label strength. Trading has got
off to a satisfactory start this year and new opportunities will be opened
by the white spirit distillery joint venture with Tate & Lyle. Forecast
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 36.5m, put the group on a prospective p/e of
14.3. Altogether a great temptation for Whyte & Mackay to return with a more
generous offer.
