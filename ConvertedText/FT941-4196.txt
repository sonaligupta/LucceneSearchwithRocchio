War-torn Cambodia was pledged more than Dollars 700m in additional aid
yesterday after an appeal by King Norodom Sihanouk for a 'Marshall Plan'
style programme to help the country back to prosperity. The offers included
Dollars 15m to help clear some of the 10m mines scattered across the country
which kill or maim about 300 people a month. The money was pledged at a
two-day conference on the reconstruction of Cambodia. The delegates, from 32
countries, the EU and 12 international organisations, noted progress in
market reforms, trade liberalisation, improved tax revenues, reduced
inflation and stable exchange rates.
