FT  27 SEP 94 / 200 Kurdish rebels killed

More than 200 people have died in eastern Turkey since government security
forces began a 'final push' late last week against mountain strongholds of
separatist Kurdish guerrillas, according to diplomats in Ankara. Government
officials say that 16 Kurdish fighters died in the eastern province of
Tunceli and that the operations ended at the weekend. But a European
diplomat put the death toll among the guerrillas alone at 200 and said
security forces would continue their sweep to Turkey's borders with Iran and
Iraq to stamp out the estimated 3,000 rebels based in the region. The
government has said it will allow six pro-Kurdish former MPs now facing
treason charges to stand for election to parliament again.
