FT  21 APR 94 / Cuban exiles go home for talks

Cuba's economically embattled government will try to mend fences with its
nationals living abroad when it meets leaders of exile groups in Havana for
a three-day conference starting tomorrow.
The agenda includes immigration, human rights and travel, but will not
include political issues, according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
The ministry, which arranged the conference, said it is intended to
'normalise links with overseas Cubans'. It is expecting about 200
participants, mainly from exile communities in the US, Europe and Latin
America.
The government says it has not invited representatives of exile groups which
have been opposed to President Fidel Castro's administration, saying that
these 'hysterics' had 'excluded themselves' by supporting the US economic
blockade of the Caribbean island, and by advocating foreign intervention in
Cuba's domestic affairs.
Those invited are representatives of exile groups which have not been openly
hostile to the Castro government, those which have advocated an end to the
economic embargo and a normalisation of relations between Washington and
Havana, and supporters of the Cuban government.
Diplomats in Havana said yesterday that the government's intention was to
bring together all shades of opinion which were not hostile to the
administration, and to try to develop a more solid and influential lobby for
an end to the economic embargo. The meeting is likely to end with a call for
a thaw in relations between Washington and Havana.
The decisions of the representatives of some Cuban exile leaders to accept
Havana's invitation have divided the exile communities, particularly in
Florida.
