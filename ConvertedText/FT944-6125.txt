FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific bid gains ground


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


   NEW YORK


Union Pacific, one of the seven biggest US railways, yesterday appeared to
be heading for victory with its Dollars 3.2bn hostile takeover bid for Santa
Fe Pacific, another of the big seven railway companies, after the federal
regulatory authorities removed Santa Fe's main objection to the offer.
The Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates mergers in the US
railway industry, said it accepted Union Pacific's plan to buy Santa Fe's
shares immediately and put them in an independent trust pending the ICC's
consideration of the takeover.
Earlier Santa Fe had rejected Union Pacific's bid, saying it was not clear
whether the ICC would accept the trust arrangement.
The ICC's decision puts Union Pacific at a significant advantage over
Burlington Northern, the friendly bidder for Santa Fe, because Burlington's
agreed Dollars 3bn bid would not take effect unless and until it had
received ICC clearance.
