Nikkei loses ground

Stock sales by corporate investors and arbitrageurs depressed share prices,
and the Nikkei 225 average lost ground in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
The index finished 192.34 off at 19,619.22 after fluctuating between
19,755.15 and 19,593.92. Equities declined initially on arbitrage linked
selling, triggered by a fall in futures prices. Financial and corporate
investors followed suit.
Traders said worries over US financial markets and the currency market ahead
of the US elections depressed investor confidence. Volume was 183.9m shares,
against 202m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 14.39 to 1,555.41 and
the Nikkei 300 lost 2.84 at 284.41. Declines outnumbered rises by 797 to
183, with 194 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on
1.45 at 1,273.39.
With announcements of interim corporate earnings reaching a peak over the
next few weeks, analysts expect to see an increase in activity prompted by
profit revisions for the whole business year. However, while investors have
reacted to negative earnings news, better than expected first-half results
have failed to move stock prices.
Nikko Securities reported that for some companies, upward revisions in
earnings had been discounted in stock prices, and even for companies
reporting unexpectedly firm earnings, the impact on the share price was
likely to be shortlived. Investors should select companies according to
their capital investment and research and development plans, the broker
said.
Overseas investors and domestic institutions sold steels, which had been
bought recently on hopes of strengthening global steel demand. Nippon Steel
eased Y1 to Y397 and NKK shed Y8 to Y289.
Heavy electrical shares lost ground on profit-taking: Mitsubishi Electric,
the day's most active issue, dipped Y6 to Y701 and Hitachi fell Y25 to Y974.
Office equipment maker Nakabayashi rose Y8 to Y978 on the pachinko, or
Japanese pinball, theme. Sailor Pen, a fountain pen maker listed on the
second section, jumped Y57 to Y936.
Nissan Motor dropped Y30 to Y794 after announcing last Friday that its
interim recurring losses totalled Y57.9bn. Other car companies were also
weak, with Suzuki Motor down Y30 to Y1,180.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y18,000 to Y897,000 on selling by
overseas and institutional investors. Japan Tobacco declined Y40,000 to
Y1.05m and Japan Telecom Y140,000 to Y3.42m.
In Osaka, the OSE average softened 152.31 to 21,810.00 in volume of 24.6m
shares.
