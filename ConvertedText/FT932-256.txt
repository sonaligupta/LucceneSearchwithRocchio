AMALGAMATED Steel Mills, Malaysia's largest steelmaker, has found new
partners for a multi-billion Malaysian dollar steel-mill project, AP-DJ
reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Schlemann-Siemag, of Germany, will supply equipment and licensed technology,
and Nucor Steel, of the US, will also participate in the project, the first
phase of which would cost MDollars 2.4bn (USDollars 928m).
The plans replace a venture with the Taiwan's government-owned China Steel
which was terminated recently.
