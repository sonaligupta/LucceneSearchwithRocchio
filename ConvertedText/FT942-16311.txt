FT  11 APR 94 / Emerging Investor: Indian issue faces uncertain reception -
The Emerging Investor


   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and SARA WEBB


India's ability to tap the capital markets for the funds it needs to lift
itself from the ranks of the world's poorer nations faces an important test
this week.
Videsh Sanchar Nigam, the state-controlled international telecommunications
utility, wants to raise Dollars 1bn in Euro-equity in the biggest-ever
Indian issue and one of the largest global issues this year.
Salomon Brothers and Kleinwort Benson, the investment banks which are
co-global co-ordinators for the issue, are now holding roadshows for the
issue, taking in cities in east Asia, Europe and the US.
Six weeks ago the VSNL offering would almost certainly have been a roaring
success - probably priced at a premium to the prevailing Indian domestic
price and almost certainly oversubscribed. Such was the popularity then of
emerging markets. Now, fund managers have grown more cautious, partly
because of the worldwide correction in stock markets which followed
increases in US interest rates and partly because of a sharp decline in
Indian equities.
Euroissues have in the past year been the most important conduit of foreign
investment into India - accounting for some Dollars 2bn of a total inflow of
Dollars 5bn in the year to March. A further Dollars 1.5bn came from
portfolio investment in the Indian stock market. The performance of the VSNL
issue will significantly influence how much India is able to raise this
year.
'VSNL will be a very significant test for the market and it will be the
bellwether for GDRs for several reasons, because it is a lot bigger than the
other Indian GDRs, because it is a telecoms stock, and because it is a
government disinvestment,' says Mr Jeff Chowdhry, director at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd Investment Management, which recently raised Dollars 510m for its
India Fund.
VSNL as a company is still seen as having great merits, holding a monopoly
of basic international telecommunications in a large developing country
which is trying to integrate its economy with the rest of the world through
foreign trade and investment. In the year ending March 1993, it made
after-tax profits of Rs1.12bn on revenues of Rs7.47bn.
However, the 10 per cent decline in prices on the Bombay stock exchange
since the end of February has made pricing the VSNL issue difficult. Prices
have fallen for a combination of reasons of which the most important is that
a correction was due after a sustained rally which had seen shares double
from lows reached last spring.
Also, investors were disappointed that the government's 1994-95 budget,
announced in late February, did not fulfil the highest hopes of those who
wanted to see strong measures to promote growth. They were concerned too
about the potential impact on inflation of the government's failure to curb
public borrowing as effectively as it had promised.
Moreover, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog,
enforced a long-threatened ban on Badla - the informal forward market in
shares which accounts for about 75 per cent of all stock exchange trading.
Badla brings liquidity to the market, but is subject to frequent abuse and
price manipulation.
As Indian equities fell, so did Indian Euroissues, often faster and further
than the underlying shares. This was mainly because these international
offerings had usually been sold at a premium to the Indian market price. So
strong was the demand for Indian paper, and so difficult is it to negotiate
the tortuous intricacy of Indian domestic settlement systems, that fund
managers were ready to pay extra for the convenience of Europaper,
particularly in those cases where they lacked the necessary FII status
allowing direct investment in the stock market.
With a few exceptions those premia have now evaporated, and most Euroequity
issues trade at discounts of up to 15 per cent of the equivalent Indian
stock exchange price.
The turmoil put a month-long stop on Indian Euroissues, which ended only
last week as three companies started road-shows: VSNL, Calcutta Electric
Supply Corporation, which launched a GDR and warrant issue (hoping to raise
Dollars 89.25m based on Friday's pricing of Dollars 53.34 per unit of five
GDRs and two warrants and an additional Dollars 35m if the warrants are
exercised), and Tube Investments, an engineering group, seeking Dollars 50m
in equity.
CESC, which supplies electricity in Calcutta, has had a difficult time
coming to market. It parted company with its original lead manager,
Kleinwort Benson, after disagreements surfaced over the price and timing of
the issue. Kleinwort wanted to bring CESC to market after VSNL, but CESC
executives wanted to go first in case investors were swamped by the giant
VSNL offering.
Paribas Capital Markets of France secured the mandate, and is now wooing
investors at exactly the same time as VSNL. Both Kleinwort and CESC declined
to comment publicly on the dispute.
Despite the setbacks in emerging markets, investment bankers believe there
is still strong demand for well-priced companies with strong prospects.
Mr Nanavati of Standard Chartered says at least two recent Indian Euroissues
 -Indo-Gulf Fertilisers, a chemicals company belonging to the industrial
grouping headed by Mr Aditya Birla, and Videocon International, the leading
consumer electronics maker - have retained premia of more than 30 per cent
above the Indian stock market price. But both issues were
attractively-priced, and both companies are believed to have particularly
good growth prospects.
Mr Chowdhry of BZW says that dedicated India funds like his prefer to invest
directly in India, while international equity offerings tended to appeal
more to the non-specialist funds. However, even the specialist funds were
looking more closely at the GDRs once they fell to a discount.
Officials at the Indian finance ministry are keeping their fingers crossed
over the VSNL issue, not least because the government is the main
shareholder. If the issue flops, India's reputation could suffer. But, if
the shares are offered too cheaply to foreigners, the government could face
domestic political attacks.
