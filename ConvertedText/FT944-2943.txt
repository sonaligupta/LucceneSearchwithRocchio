FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: ED&F Man matches forecast with Pounds 31m


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


ED&F Man, the agricultural products and financial services trading group
which came to the market in October, announced pre-tax profits ahead by 19
per cent from Pounds 26.3m to Pounds 31.2m in the half year to
end-September.
The rise, which was in line with indications given at the time of the
flotation, was attributed to strong performances by the agricultural
products and brokerage divisions. However, the fund management business was
adversely affected by volatility in financial markets.
The group declined to give a turnover figure. Mr Harvey McGrath, managing
director, said: 'Turnover is not a meaningful figure in our business because
of the variation in commodity prices.' He added that in commodity tonnage
terms, the half-year period was up by 18 per cent. He warned, however, that
this figure too could be unduly influenced by market conditions.
Earnings per share rose by 29 per cent to 8.9p (6.9p). The company is paying
a second interim dividend - set at 3.2p - at this stage, effectively as an
advance payment against the final dividend. In future, it intended to pay
the interim in February, followed by the final in September.
The shares slipped 1p to 170p, still below the flotation price of 180p.
Volumes in the agricultural products division rose by 18 per cent in the
first half, with profits almost doubled at Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 11.1m).
Particularly buoyant were profits from sugar, up from Pounds 4.4m to Pounds
9.9m, and cocoa, ahead at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 1.9m).
Profits in the brokerage business rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 5.4m (Pounds
4.4m). But profits from fund management declined by 46 per cent to Pounds
6.2m (Pounds 11.5m). Mr McGrath cautioned that unfavourable market
conditions continued to undermine the division's performance.
However, he remained confident about the overall outlook for the group for
the rest of the year.
