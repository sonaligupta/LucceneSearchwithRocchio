FT  04 AUG 92 / Imro post for Gartmore chief


MR PAUL MYNERS, chairman and chief executive of Gartmore Investment
Management, has been appointed to the board of Imro, the self-regulatory
body for the fund management industry.
The Imro board has several vacancies, including that of its former chairman,
Mr George Nissen, who resigned in June over criticism of the body's
supervision of companies controlled by Robert Maxwell.
Mr Myners said he will 'definitely not' be chairman. His nomination reflects
a desire on Imro's part to encourage more industry practitioners to be
involved in the self-regulatory process, he said.
