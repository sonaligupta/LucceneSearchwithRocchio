   By LAURIE MORSE and BERNARD SIMON


   CHICAGO, TORONTO


Bank of Montreal has begun a long-planned expansion into the Chicago banking
market with the purchase of Suburban Bancorp.
The deal will merge Suburban, which has USDollars 1.3bn in assets, with Bank
of Montreal's Chicago subsidiary, Harris Bancorp, with assets of Dollars
13.5bn. Under the agreement, Bank of Montreal will pay around Dollars 246m
by exchanging 3.93 of its own shares for each of Suburban's. Based on
Friday's closing markets, it will pay Dollars 73.08 a share for Suburban, or
about 17 times 1994 earnings.
Suburban Bancorp owns 13 community banks in Chicago's suburbs and the
majority of its stock is owned by members of the Gerald Fitzgerald family,
which has agreed to the sale.
The acquisition will boost the Chicago profile of Harris Bancorp, which has
banks in 42 locations and is the parent of Harris Bank, one of the five
largest banks in Chicago.
The deal is the first big acquisition for Harris since the Bank of Montreal
unveiled plans to treble its Chicago subsidiary's earnings and market share
within a decade. It is competing for acquisitions with large
expansion-minded regional US banks.
Bank of Montreal will file a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange
Commission relating to the shares it will issue to pay for the acquisition.
