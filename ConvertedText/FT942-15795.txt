FT  13 APR 94 / Government Bonds: US prices post gains after March inflation
data

   NEW YORK, LONDON


Longer-dated US Treasury prices posted modest gains yesterday after the
first set of March inflation data came in broadly in line with expectations
and the Federal Reserve conducted a 'coupon pass'.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 88
13/32 , yielding 7.198 per cent. The two-year note was only slightly firmer,
up  1/16 at 99 17/32 , to yield 5.361 per cent.
The eagerly-awaited March producer prices index produced no surprises. The
0.2 per cent increase was what most analysts had been forecasting. Core
producer prices  - which exclude the volatile food and energy components  -
were also up by 0.2 per cent.
Bond prices rose immediately after the figures were released on relief that
they contained no bad news, but the market was unable to sustain its initial
highs. Later in the morning, expectation of a 'coupon pass' by the Federal
Reserve  - when it buys securities in the market to permanently add reserves
to the banking system  - kept prices in positive territory.
Those expectations were met when the Fed aggressively acquired securities at
the intermediate and long end of the maturity range, which subsequently
boosted prices in those sectors of the market.
European government bond markets gave up early gains even though the US PPI
data was in line with expectations. The mood was cautious ahead of the
Bundesbank's council meeting tomorrow and the release of UK inflation data
on Friday, and most dealers were seen to be reluctant to take out large
positions ahead of these events.
UK gilts traded in a one-point range and analysts expect the market to
remain stuck in this range until Friday's numbers. The June contract on the
long gilt future went as high as 108 25/32 but eased to 107 15/16 in the
late afternoon, down  5/32 points on the day. The ceiling for the contract
is widely seen to be 109.
Dealers were also looking ahead to Friday's auction announcement by the Bank
of England. Mr Ifty Islam, fixed-income analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the
market expected the Bank to raise Pounds 2bn to Pounds 2 1/2 bn by
re-opening the 7 3/4 per cent issue due 2006 or the 6 1/4 per cent issue due
2010.
Some analysts said the recent under-performance of Irish gilts in relation
to UK gilts had prompted foreigners to move back into the Irish market. The
yield on 10-year Irish gilts is now 10 basis points below UK gilts, against
30 basis points two weeks ago.
A weaker D-Mark and nerves ahead of the Bundesbank meeting eroded the early
gains made in the German government bond market. The June contract on the
bund future on Liffe eased 0.08 points in the late afternoon to 97.23 after
a high of 97.70.
Dealers were still hopeful that the Bundesbank meeting would yield something
positive for the market, either in the form of a cut in the Lombard rate or
confirmation of its recent policy of nudging repo rates lower.
Persistent worries about the political situation in France kept the pressure
on French government bonds and dealers reported that the yield spread over
bunds widened to 34 basis points but tightened in to 30 basis points in the
late afternoon.
The French notional bond future on the Matif eased 0.18 points to 123.64 in
late trading.
Continued optimism that Italy would soon have a government underpinned
Italian government bonds and brought the yields on 10-year paper to within 8
basis points of their Spanish counterparts.
The market was also supported by comments by the Bank of Italy governor, Mr
Antonio Fazio, that the lower yields at Monday's Treasury bill auctions
signalled a resumption in the downward trend in Italian interest rates.
The June contract of the Italian government bond future on Liffe stood 0.02
points higher at 114.48 in the late afternoon, off the day's high of 115.10.
Spanish government bonds outperformed other European markets but also lost
steam towards the close. The market is looking to today's Bank of Spain repo
tender, which could result in lower rates. Spanish inflation and
unemployment figures are also due this week.
The Spanish bond future went as high as 101.05 before easing to 100.58 in
the late afternoon, for a gain of 0.18 points on the day.
