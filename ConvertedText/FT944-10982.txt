FT  08 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: UK utility loan terms under
fire


   By MARTIN BRICE


Terms on a forthcoming syndicated loan for East Midlands Electricity, the UK
power utility, is attracting fierce criticism from syndicate managers.
They say pricing of 15 basis points over Libor on the Pounds 350m loan,
which is being arranged by Chemical Bank, is too low and for this reason it
is not yet finalised after three weeks.
'This may be a deal too far,' said one member of a syndicated loans team at
an investment bank in London.
Supply of new loans has outstripped demand this year, driving down pricing
as banks, hungry for assets, have turned aggressively to the syndicated
loans market while borrowers remain wary of large debts.
The interest rate on a syndicated loan is usually set at a margin over
Libor, the benchmark interest rate for the market. Over the past year, the
spread on a syndicated loan to a typical European corporate borrower, with a
Single A credit rating, has dropped from about 45 basis points to around 20
to 22 basis points and may fall still further.
However, although Chemical Bank would not comment on a deal still in
syndication, it is believed in the market that a Pounds 500m loan for
National Power being arranged by Chemical at a margin of 17 basis points has
been oversubscribed.
One syndicate manager said: 'Although East Midlands is a good UK name, 15
basis points over does not reward you sufficiently. Chemical is pushing the
market further than it wants to go. But although we have reached the bottom,
I don't think prices will start to go up.'
