FT  21 NOV 92 / Andrew Sansom - accountant: Obituary


MR ANDREW SANSOM, 55, the secretary of the Chartered Association of
Certified Accountants, who has died unexpectedly, matched his commitment to
the accountancy profession only with the enormous breadth of his other
interests.
It was entirely in character that he was on a visit to the ballet when he
suffered a fatal heart attack on Thursday night.
Andrew Sansom brought a strong international perspective to his work with
the association, which reflected his considerable overseas experience. He
set strong administrative foundations for the organisation and developed its
overseas and educational activities with a combination of determination and
a courteous, gentlemanly style reminiscent of a venerable bishop.
He was an active member of the Church of England and his other interests
included opera, ballet, gardening and amateur dramatics. Conversation in his
company ranged far beyond accountancy.
He is survived by his wife and one son.
