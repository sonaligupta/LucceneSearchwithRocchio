FT  04 SEP 93 / Spain cuts interest rates


   By TOM BURNS

THE BANK of Spain yesterday cut its key intervention rate by half a point to
10 per cent, signalling its confidence that the government will persuade
unions to limit wage rises and that the recession could have bottomed out.
The decision also reflected a strong performance by the peseta that has
given the monetary authorities considerable room to manoeuvre.
Boosted by foreign purchases of Spanish debt and equities, the currency has
risen by almost 4 per cent against the D-Mark in the past few weeks and is
within its old exchange rate band before the European Monetary System
crisis.
The cut prompted most private banks to bring down lending to prime borrowers
by between 25 and 50 basis points to between 10 and 11 per cent. Lending
rates are now at their cheapest since the early 1980s.
The key factor in the cut appeared to be the expectation of a three-year
'social pact' wage agreement. Negotiations with the unions opened this week
and are expected to be completed in time for the government to present a
restrictive budget to parliament at the end of the month.
A second cause is likely to have been the Bank of Spain's guarded belief
that recovery could be close. The Bank's first-half report noted that
certain indicators suggested the recession had touched bottom.
Some analysts were, however, surprised by the boldness of the rate cut.
Arguing that wage restraint was not yet in place, that government borrowing
requirements were high and that inflation remained stubbornly above 4.5 per
cent, Mr Frederick Artessani, director of equities at Madrid securities
house Benito y Monjardin, said the central bank 'might have had its arm
twisted by the government.'
