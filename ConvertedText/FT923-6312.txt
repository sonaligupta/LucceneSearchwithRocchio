FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa declines 24%


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


TRYGG-Hansa SPP, the Swedish insurance group, yesterday reported a 24 per
cent drop in operating profit for the first half of the year to SKr894m
(Dollars 170m), down from SKr1.17bn for the same period of 1991.
But at the same time its subsidiary, the Gota financial group, announced a
huge SKr1.11bn loss for the same period, compared with a SKr807m deficit for
the first six months of last year.
After a SKr969m injection from a financial insurance package created by
Trygg-Hansa this summer to save Gota from collapse, the loss was much less
than the SKr2.08bn it would otherwise have been. Gota Bank suffered a
SKr884m financial loss in the first half compared with SKr689m for the same
period of 1991.
In its property and casualty insurance business Trygg-Hansa SPP increased
its income from premiums to SKr3.85bn from SKr3.58bn. Insurance claims
increased by 16 per cent to SKr3.14bn from SKr2.71bn due mainly to higher
losses in reinsurance but also to a large business volume.
Operating expenses amounted to SKr1.008bn, up from SKr979m. The operating
profit amounted to SKr647m, down from SKr1.499bn for the first six months of
last year. The fall was blamed on falling share prices.
The main difficulty for the insurance company will continue to lie with Gota
which it took into ownership this summer and which forms part of its banking
and finance operations.
From the end of last June Gota has been a subsidiary of Trygg-Hansa SPP and
its financial results will be consolidated.
Credit losses have been much larger than those sustained by other Swedish
banks but with Trygg-Hansa SPP's support it looks in better shape to weather
the storm than other commercial banks.
The value of Trygg-Hansa SPP's real estate portfolio declined by 5 per cent
in the first six months to SKr159m.
Earlier this month Trygg-Hansa SPP announced a new share issue of not more
than SKr2.525bn at SKr36 per share with the subscription period running from
September 14 to October 13.
