FT  28 JAN 94 / Pounds 75m cash call for a northern Wembley


   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent


Manchester is to ask for Pounds 75m from the government's millennium fund
and the National Lottery to help build a stadium.
The application for a 'Wembley of the north' will be supported by various
sports bodies including the Football Association, the British Athletics
Federation, the Rugby Football League and the Rugby Football Union.
The stadium and associated infrastructure would cost Pounds 187m. It would
seat 65,000 people, be on the site planned for the Olympics and be based on
the same design.
The public sector has already contributed Pounds 72m to land acquisition and
a new road linking the stadium site to the motorway network. The aim would
be to complete construction by 1998 if funding could be agreed.
Parts of the Millennium Fund and National Lottery are intended to encourage
sports projects and help celebrate the millennium.
Mr Terry Venables will today become manager of the England football team.
The Football Association, governing body of the national game, will hold a
press conference at Wembley Stadium this afternoon to announce the
appointment of the manager.
Sources at the FA said: 'There will not be any surprises, everyone seems to
know already.'
