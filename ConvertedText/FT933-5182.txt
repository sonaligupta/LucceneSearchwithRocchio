FT  04 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation


Mr Rupert Murdoch's decision to shed his interest in the South China Morning
Post looks pragmatic rather than part of a grand design. With the Post's
shares trading at a record high and the handover of Hong Kong to China
looming, the opportunity to take a handsome profit was too good to miss. The
prospect of running a daily newspaper after 1997 is evidently not to the
free-wheeling media mogul's liking. That will do nothing for frayed nerves
elsewhere in the colony.
True, cutting links with the Post might also get round political objections
to his involvement in TVB, the Hong Kong television company in which News
Corporation tried to buy a stake in June. But with control of satellite
broadcaster Star TV secured in the meantime, terrestrial television seems of
lesser importance. Although feeding TVB's library of Chinese language
programmes through Star TV makes perfect sense, that might easily be
achieved without an equity stake.
With so many deals struck in such a short space of time, Mr Murdoch is
making up for time lost in the straight-jacket imposed by the banks. If he
can resist the unnecessary deal along the way, so much the better.
