FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Support for the small
firm - In a Nutshell


The role of trade associations and similar small-firm support bodies is
discussed in a 37-page booklet* which has just become available.
Written by Ray Parr, previously manager of the Department of Trade and
Industry's Small Firms Information Centre in the Midlands and now a
volunteer counsellor in a local enterprise agency, it sets out to help
readers choose the most appropriate representative organisation. It details
the cost of membership as well as listing the services provided.
Parr believes the value of support is often overlooked.
'All too often attention is concentrated on that essential and often
necessary trip to the accountant, bank manager and solicitor, but that
should not obscure the potential of a fourth leg to the support framework.'
*'Any other Body' is published as a private venture, price Pounds 2.95. It
can be ordered from Caterpiller Publishing, Caterpiller House, 19 Donnington
Drive, Christchurch, Dorset BH23 4SZ
