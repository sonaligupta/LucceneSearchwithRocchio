FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: ATA Selection fails to pay final dividend


ATA Selection, the recruitment agency and financial services group, did not
make the recovery expected during 1990.
As a result pre-tax profit has fallen from Pounds 846,000 to Pounds 41,000.
The final dividend is omitted leaving the year's payment at 1p (2.5p).
The directors recall that at the time of the rights issue they expected some
recovery in profit and forecast maintaining the final dividend at 1.5p.
Earnings were only 0.16p (4.36p).
Conditions remained difficult in the first quarter of this year,
particularly in recruitment which continued to trade at a loss. The
financial services side was making profits.
