FT  30 JAN 92 / Revenue consults on Finance Bill


THE INLAND Revenue yesterday invited comments on two draft clauses for the
next Finance Bill.
The clauses deal with the tax treatment of insolvent groups of companies and
are designed to close loopholes on rights to profits for shareholders when a
company is being wound up, and on charges to companies which leave a group
during insolvency proceedings.
The new legislation follows the defeat of the Revenue last year in a Court
of Appeal case against J. Sainsbury, the retailer. It would be effective
from November 15 last year.
