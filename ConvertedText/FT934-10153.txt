FT  06 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&A: Share swap avoids CGT


If a company of which I am a shareholder receives a bid in cash and shares
from another company, I understand that, if I accept the cash alternative, I
have made a disposal for CGT purposes. If, however, I accept a change or
exchange of shares, have I then avoided a disposal for CGT purposes?
Yes, by virtue of section 135 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.
Ask your tax office for the free explanatory pamphlets CGT13 (The indexation
allowance for quoted shares) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction).
