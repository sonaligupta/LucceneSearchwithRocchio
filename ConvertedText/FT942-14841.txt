FT  19 APR 94 / China's PM in Central Asia


   By TONY WALKER


   BEIJING


Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, has begun a four-nation tour of Central
Asia aimed at promoting Beijing's political and commercial interests in an
unstable region on its troubled western frontier.
Mr Li, who last year deferred a visit to the former Soviet republics because
of heart problems, is certain to seek assurances that Central Asian leaders
will not help Moslem separatists in China itself. China has a Moslem
population of about 10m, with most in the under-populated western province
of Xinjiang.
He arrived in Uzbekistan yesterday and will visit Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan
and Kazakhstan before returning home via Mongolia. For the first time, a
Chinese leader travelling abroad has included businessmen and traders in his
party.
Mr Zheng Hongye, president of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade, said businessmen would sign a 'range of agreements' in
construction, textiles, electronics, telecommunications, petrochemicals and
mineral resources.
Beijing is anxious to extend its commercial reach into Central Asia as a
means of strengthening its political influence in a region that
traditionally it has regarded as important to its security and well-being.
