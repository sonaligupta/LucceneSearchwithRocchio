FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Neste to sell rest of battery
stake


   By ROBERT TAYLOR


   STOCKHOLM


NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals conglomerate, plans to sell
for an undisclosed amount its remaining 50 per cent stake in its battery
division to S E Del Acumulador Tudor (Grupo Tudor) of Spain, one of Europe's
leading battery companies.
It was in March 1990 that Tudor bought the first half of the battery
division from Neste. In a statement, Tudor said its intention was to create
a pan-Nordic subsidiary company with an annual SKr1bn (Dollars 170m)
turnover, specialising in the production of batteries for vehicles and
industry as part of the group's European restructuring programme.
'The Neste battery division has made large losses and the group needs a
strong owner,' said Mr Ulf Hogland, vice-president of the Tudor group.
Efforts are being made to reduce the division's costs which Tudor says are
too high in a very competitive market.
Since 1987, the Spanish company has cut its labour force in the Nordic
region to 750 from 1,400 and rationalisation will continue.
