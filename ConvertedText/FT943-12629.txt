FT  23 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Making your money work - For that,
you need facts  / Where to find them


   By ANTHONY BAILEY


Information is essential to managing your cash, just as it is for investing
in shares. Although putting cash on deposit should be the most
straightforward part of managing a portfolio, it is often difficult to know
where to locate the best rates. Here is a run-down of useful sources.
MoneyFacts
A monthly bulletin gives savings rates (including tax-exempt special savings
accounts, offshore accounts and accounts for businesses, charities and
clubs) from around 70 building societies and a range of banks, although the
smallest are excluded. In addition, there are details of current and student
accounts and National Savings.
The fixed-rate section includes local authority bonds, retail co-ops and
guaranteed income bonds. Borrowing also is covered, taking in credit, gold
and store cards, personal loans and mortgages from around 100 lenders.
The service is aimed primarily at the professional adviser, although one-off
copies of the magazine can be obtained for Pounds 4.25*. But information can
soon become stale in a monthly publication of this sort. For this reason, it
is being updated constantly on the main MoneyFacts database.
Three premium-rate lines give a lengthy summary of the latest rates:
0336-400 238 for savings, 0336-400 239 for mortgages, and 0336-400 237 for
commercial mortgages. You will need a fax machine to receive the
information. The cost is likely to be around Pounds 4 to Pounds 5, depending
on when you call.
Some information is available free on Channel 4's teletext service (pages
545-546).
MoneyFacts also provides the Weekend FT with its Highest Rates for Your
Money table - on page VII today.
Blay's Guides
These are another comprehensive source of information and also aimed at
professionals. Unlike MoneyFacts, you are given both gross and gross
compound annual rates. In addition, you can find out the net rates for both
25 and 40 per cent taxpayers.
You cannot buy an individual copy of the monthly paper-based Blay's
MoneyMaster but it is sometimes found in public reference libraries.
Alternatively, find out if your financial adviser subscribes to the more
sophisticated computer-based version of the service.
A fair amount of free information can be found on BBC2's Ceefax, pages
261-267.
Chase de Vere
This is a firm of independent financial advisers well-known for its
comprehensive guide to the personal equity plan market. In addition, it runs
a Moneyline service, which can take 200 to 300 calls on a quiet day. This
costs nothing and can be dialled via Freephone.
Savings details from all building societies and the large banks are updated
once a week. Inquirers will be sent a neat summary of the top-paying account
for different levels of investment, different notice periods, and for fixed
terms. There is also a summary of guaranteed income bonds.
The firm's subsidiary, London & Country Mortgages, has a Freephone line
(0800-373 300) with mortgage information.
Which? Moneyfax
This is the newest of the services but, in many ways, is the least
impressive. Launched in June, it compresses too much on to one page: a range
of best-buy savings rates (including Tessas) along with details of credit
cards, mortgages, personal loans and overdrafts. Similar summaries can be
found in many newspapers and magazines.
By its nature, Moneyfax can be only a starting point for financial decisions
and it will cost you about Pounds 1 to get it - cheap, but not a best buy.
You will need a fax machine and the telephone line is premium rate.
FT Cityline
This provides a comprehensive mortgage service, updated daily, at a premium
rate. Again, you will need a fax machine. The 18 specialist lines include
one on fixed-rate re-mortgages and another on first-time buyer deals.
The cost could be Pounds 2 to Pounds 5 depending on the length of the fax.
You can get details of the different numbers to ring from the Cityline help
desk. A similar service for savings rates is being developed.
Individual institutions
Some organisations operate information lines, most with Freephone (0800)
numbers. But you will, of course, be given details only for in-house
products. Even so, savers often have their own reasons for choosing or
sticking with a particular organisation.
