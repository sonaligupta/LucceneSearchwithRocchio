FT  10 JAN 92 / Fierce start to battle for Oracle


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE ITV companies are planning to bid against each other for the UK's
commercial teletext franchise.
Oracle runs the present ITV teletext output of news and information. It is a
wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies and is working on its own bid
for the franchise.
But Oracle, which has a turnover of about Pounds 10m and pre-tax profit
approaching Pounds 3m, is to be opposed by a consortium being put together
by Independent Television News, which is also a wholly owned subsidiary of
the ITV companies.
Anglia and Yorkshire are believed to be seriously considering backing the
ITN bid. Scottish Television has been approached but is considering its
position.
To add to the complexity two of the new franchise winners are planning bids.
Carlton Communications may bid with Intelfax, which provides the information
for Channel 4's teletext service.
MAI Broadcasting, the company behind Meridian, winner of the franchise for
the south of England, is also considering involvement in a bid, as is TV-am,
loser of the commercial breakfast franchise.
