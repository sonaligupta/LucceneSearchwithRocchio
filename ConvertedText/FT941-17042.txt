FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Crabtree Group turns in Pounds 1.07m after
takeover


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Crabtree Group, the Tyne-side manufacturer and supplier of metal decorating
presses, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.07m on turnover of
Pounds 7.73m for the nine months to September 30.
Crabtree came to the market in June via a Pounds 19.4m shares and cash
reverse takeover of Somerset, a shell quoted investment trust. The figures
for the nine months consisted solely of the activities of Crabtree of
Gateshead since its acquisition on June 21.
Earnings per share came out at 10.7p and a maiden dividend of 2p is
proposed.
Before the reverse takeover, Mr Karl Watkin, Crabtree's chairman, and Mr
Matt Cooper, managing director, warranted that in the year to end-September
1993 Crabtree would make a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3m and pledged to repay
Pounds 5 of the takeover consideration for every Pounds 1 of any shortfall.
For the full 12 months to the period-end Crabtree achieved warranted profits
of Pounds 3.01m on turnover of Pounds 23.4m.
Yesterday Mr Watkin said the Pounds 3m pre-tax profit pledge had been
achieved. 'We're delighted to deliver to the City what we promised in June,'
he said.
The Pounds 3.01m reported consisted, however, of Pounds 2.86m in pre-tax
profit, plus some adjustments specified in the reverse takeover.
The shares rose 13p to 284p yesterday. When the company came to the market
in June the shares were priced at 150p.
Crabtree of Gateshead was acquired by Mr Watkin and Mr Cooper in a Pounds
3.6m management buy-out from Vickers in 1986. It claims to be the world's
leading manufacturer of metal decorating presses and exports 93 per cent of
its turnover.
The company said its results for the 12 months to September 30 were a record
performance, with turnover 24 per cent up on the preceding year's Pounds
18.8m, and profit up by 46 per cent, from Pounds 2.06m.
Mr Watkin said future order books were 'exceptionally strong'.
Crabtree, he said, was well ahead of the competition, including the Germans
and Japanese, in the quality of its engineering as well as its marketing,
and was investing to maintain that lead.
At the time of flotation, Mr Watkin said Crabtree was looking to make a
substantial acquisition. Yesterday he said this had yet to happen because
the market was at present 'very frothy'.
Credit Lyonnais Laing, Crabtree's broker, yesterday forecast pre-tax profits
for the company in the year to September 30 1994, of Pounds 3.95m on
turnover of Pounds 25m. They also forecast earnings per share of 18.7p and a
dividend of 6p.
