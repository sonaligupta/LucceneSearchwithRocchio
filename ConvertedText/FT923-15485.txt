FT  02 JUL 92 / Retailers urge lease shake-up


   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent


A CAMPAIGN to reform 'outdated, unjust property laws' was launched yesterday
by the Property Market Reform Group, a newly formed retailers' pressure
group.
The group, which is backed by retailers including Clarks, Thorntons and
Etam, is pressing for changes in commercial property leases. It says the
traditional lease, which lasts 25 years and has upward-only reviews, has
caused inflation, bankruptcies and a deepening recession in the high street.
The launch of the campaign coincides with a report on the flaws in the
commercial property market by the Adam Smith Research Trust.
The report, by Professor John Burton of Birmingham Business School, says the
rigidity of retailers' property costs has 'produced a situation of
nightmarish crisis in many components of UK retailing'.
The chief trouble identified by Prof Burton is that rents are not being
pushed down as a result of falling retail profits. That is preventing a fall
in retailers' costs, which in turn stops them from cutting prices and
tempting customers.
'The rent review process constitutes an institutionalised, legally induced
form of cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces,' the report
says.
It calls for changes to the process by which rents are agreed and recommends
the abolition of confidential clauses in rent reviews to give greater market
transparency.
It calls for the cancellation of upward-only clauses in commercial leases
and says responsibility for rent payments should not remain with the
original tenant if the lease is assigned to another tenant.
