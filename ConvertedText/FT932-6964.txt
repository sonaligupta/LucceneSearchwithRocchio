FT  26 MAY 93 / UK Company News: MTM meeting backs sale and refinancing


The reorganisation plans of MTM, the fine chemical company, advanced a
further stage yesterday when an extraordinary meeting agreed the details
including the sale of most of the company's assets to BTP, its fellow
chemical company.
MTM is now seeking to grow the remaining UK agrochemicals business through
improvements in production and marketing. It is also looking to invest in
technology-based industries.
BTP is paying Pounds 100m, financed by a rights issue. Following the egm
decision it sent out allotment letters for the shares, dealings in which are
expected to start today.
Of the proceeds, MTM will use Pounds 90m to repay bank debt and retain the
balance. The outstanding bank debt will be converted into equity giving them
29.9 per cent of the reorganised company.
