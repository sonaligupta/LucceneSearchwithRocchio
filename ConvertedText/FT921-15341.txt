FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): R&D spending growing slowly


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


SPENDING on R&D in the US in 1992 will grow in real terms by less than 1 per
cent over 1991, according to the annual forecast from Battelle, the
Columbus, Ohio-based research organisation.
Battelle predicts that annual spending will reach Dollars 155.9bn (Pounds
85.6bn) this year, an increase of just 2.8 per cent on the Dollars 151.6bn
that the National Science Foundation estimates was spent on R&D in 1991.
When inflation at 2 per cent is taken into account, this reduces the
increase to less than 1 per cent - compared with the 3.3 per cent average
annual increase in spending between 1981-84.
Industrial funding will account for 51.6 per cent of the total, says
Battelle, with federal funding accounting for 43.3 per cent.
Battelle: US, 614 424 3889; UK, 071 493 0184.
