FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Severance costs leave Mining & Allied lower


Mining & Allied Supplies, the power transmission group, suffered a setback
in its first half but is looking for the year's profit to be in line with
the Pounds 281,000 achieved in 1990-91.
In the six months ended March 31 1992 pre-tax profit slumped from Pounds
161,000 to Pounds 12,000, after absorbing a loss of Pounds 129,000 in
Westwood Dawes. That included substantial severance costs as the workforce
had been cut by 57 per cent since last September.
During the last two months Westwood's order intake showed signs of recovery,
but break-even was expected for the year, said Mr Daniel Slabbert, the
chairman. Its future viability was being re-assesed as it constituted less
than 7.5 per cent of group sales.
Group turnover slipped to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 10.4m). Earnings per share
came to 0.04p (0.38p).
In Canada the group is to strengthen its capital base by merging its
subsidiary with Heenan Senlac Resources, and the resultant undertaking will
be listed in Toronto. With the initial share consideration and a placing to
follow, the UK company will control 74.9 per cent of the capital.
The Canadian business can then expand without having to rely on the parent
company for additional requirements.
