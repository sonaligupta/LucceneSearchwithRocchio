   NEW YORK


Saturn, an experimental car company set up by General Motors to compete more
effectively with Japanese carmakers, said yesterday it expected funding from
GM for a new model in the 1996-97 period, writes Martin Dickson in New York.
Saturn makes a single model, distributed through a dedicated retailer
network.
The subsidiary, which began manufacturing in 1990, earned a small profit in
1993 after taxes but before interest payments on Dollars 1.9bn of debt, Mr
Thomas Manoff, vice-president for finance, said yesterday at the Detroit
Auto Show. It is Saturn's first annual profit.
