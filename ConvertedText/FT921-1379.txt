FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Ex-BAT chief to take chair at Cannon Street


   By ROLAND RUDD


CANNON Street Investments, the industrial holding company undergoing a
financial reorganisation, is to appoint a new chairman as it prepares for
further disposals to bring down borrowings.
The company is expected to announce on Thursday, when it publishes its
results, that Mr Tom Long, a former director of BAT Industries, is to become
chairman. He will replace Mr John Maclean, who took over the chair in
December.
Mr Long's appointment follows pressure from institutional investors who had
wanted to see an independent non-executive chairman. He helped BAT to repel
Sir James Goldsmith's unbundling attempts in 1989 and is a former chairman
of Foseco, now part of Burmah Castrol.
