FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cookson 40% rise aided by exchange rate
movements


   By PAUL TAYLOR


COOKSON GROUP, the specialist industrial materials company, yesterday
reported a 40 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, helped by exchange
rate movements and gains on disposals.
However, the results disappointed the market and Cookson's shares lost 11p
to close at 220p. One analyst blamed the share price decline on 'unrealistic
expectations egged on by management.'
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 47.2m in the six
months to June 30 on turnover which grew by nearly 17 per cent to Pounds
710.1m (Pounds 609.5m).
Earnings increased to 5.8p (4p) out of which the company is paying an
unchanged interim dividend of 3p.
Mr Richard Oster, chief executive, said the continuing improvement had been
achieved despite difficult market conditions in the UK and continental
Europe which showed little sign of improvement.
Exchange rate movements added about Pounds 5m to pre-tax profits and Pounds
74m to sales compared with the 1992 period. Mr Robert Malpas, chairman, said
that at constant exchange rates sales rose by about 4 per cent and pre-tax
profits by 22 per cent. At constant exchange rates, and excluding a Pounds
5.5m gain on disposals, pre-tax profits were up 8 per cent.
Group operating profits increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 50.3m (Pounds
42.7m). On a like-for-like basis, adjusted for exchange rates and a number
of other factors, including a higher Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.2m)
rationalisation charge, the underlying increase in operating profits was
about Pounds 4m or about 9 per cent.
The continuing good performance of most of the group's businesses was offset
by particular difficulties in the aluminium, lead stabiliser and pigments
businesses and in some of the development companies.
Four businesses lost Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 1.7m) and depressed the overall
operating profit return on sales to just over 7 per cent against a target of
10 per cent.
Net interest payments were little changed at Pounds 8.6m and should fall in
the second half as a result of a marked decline in borrowings which fell to
Pounds 140m at the end of June against Pounds 341m at December 31. Net
borrowings represent gearing of 21 per cent, down from 74 per cent at year
end.
COMMENT
Despite the market over-reaction to yesterday's figures - which still showed
a healthy profit gain once special factors were stripped out - Cookson is
making progress towards its strategic goals. However, there is concern that
rationalisation costs are still running at about Pounds 5m-Pounds 6m a year,
and are likely to continue, and that the handful of lossmaking businesses
are dragging margins down. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 100.2m are likely
this year, equivalent to earnings per share of 12.3p meaning the shares are
trading on a prospective p/e of 18.
