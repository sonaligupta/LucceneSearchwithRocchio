FT  12 MAR 93 / Moslems take UK troops hostage


   By REUTER


   SARAJEVO


A United Nations relief mission in former Yugoslavia ran into trouble
yesterday when hundreds of angry Moslems held British troops and their
armoured vehicles hostage in a besieged Bosnian town, Reuter reports from
Sarajevo.
The British-escorted convoy had gone to Konjevic Polje in eastern Bosnia, to
try and evacuate 75 people injured in fighting between Serb and Moslem
forces in the area.
Mr Jan Erik Linstad of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said after fleeing the settlement that according to the British convoy
commander, Major Alan Abraham, and four soldiers in two armoured cars had
been surrounded 'by a living wall of hundreds of Moslems climbing all over
the vehicles.'
The British military said the villagers had set fire to bales of hay in
order to block the escape of the vehicles. But while the British soldiers
had been unable to move, they had not felt intimidated.
There was no indication of how long the British were likely to stay cooped
up in Konjevic Polje, where shelling was reported.
A British soldier was being flown back to Britain for urgent medical
treatment in a very serious condition after being wounded by a mine in
Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday, the ministry said.
