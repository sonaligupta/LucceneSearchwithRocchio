FT  15 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure


The stock exchange's draft guidelines on corporate disclosure have drawn a
first public response from Hoare Govett, which admits to worry about the
low-key nature of the call on companies to give more information. This homes
in on the central nature of the problem. There is a need to ensure
information is disseminated fairly, but there is also a need to formulate
the guidelines in such a way that companies do not simply clam up. In
practice that means that an obligation to inform may have to accompany a ban
on selective leaking of information.
This points inexorably towards the introduction of a quarterly reporting
requirement together with some prescription for the minimum amount of detail
such statements might be expected to include. Companies may not like the
extra work involved: in the end, though, it could cause them less time and
trouble than continuous worry about what does or does not constitute market
sensitive information. Indeed any attempt to make the guidelines define the
term market sensitive is bound to come adrift.
Quarterly statements would not, of course, absolve companies from issuing
timely announcements when the unexpected happens. Nor should such
information be dribbled into the market. After all, cheapening technology
will give even small investors access to a Topic screen or its equivalent
sooner or later.
