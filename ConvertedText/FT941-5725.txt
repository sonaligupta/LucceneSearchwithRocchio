FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Special gains boost Orkla

Orkla, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from branded consumer
goods to chemical processing, announced yesterday that pre-tax profits in
1993 advanced more than four-fold, helped by solid gains from shares and a
stronger performance by industrial activities.
The board proposed to increase the dividend to NKr4.10 a share from NKr3.75.
Group pre-tax profit rose sharply to NKr1.32bn (Dollars 178m) from NKr315m,
as sales increased to NKr17.85bn from NKr16.81bn. Operating profit advanced
by 7 per cent to NKr1.27bn.
Net financial items charged against accounts fell to NKr523m from NKr606m as
share of profit from associated companies nearly doubled NKr219m from
NKr112m.
Industrial activities lifted operating profit to NKr1.24bn from NKr1.17bn.
Branded consumer goods' activities increased market shares for most
important products but operating margins fell slightly.
Chemicals saw increased demand for important products and improved operating
margins as a result of a shift in product mix, efficiency, reduced raw
materials costs and favourable exchange rates.
Investment activities increased operating profit to NKr29m from NKr20, and
recorded a booked pre-tax profit of NKr273m, significantly better than in
1992, when stocks on the Oslo bourse fell heavily.
Realised gains on shares in 1993 reached NKr350m against losses of NKr381m
in 1992, while unrealised gains shot up by nearly NKr2.5bn from NKr5m.
