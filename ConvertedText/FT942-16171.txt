FT  12 APR 94 / People: Non-executive directors


Elliott Bernerd, the 48-year-old property developer, has recruited Sir Alan
Hardcastle, 60, a former head of the government's accountancy service, as a
non-executive director of his latest quoted property venture - Chelsfield.
Sir Alan, who stepped down from the Treasury last September, is a former
senior partner of KPMG Peat Marwick. He is currently chairman of the
regulatory board of Lloyd's of London and is a member of the Bank of
England's board of banking supervision.
Sir Alan, who held the title of chief accountancy adviser at the Treasury,
will be chairman of Chelsfield's audit committee. The committee, made up
solely of Chelsfield's non-executive directors, will receive and review
reports from the management and the auditors relating to the accounts and
the group's internal control systems.
Bernerd, who owns 30 per cent of Chelsfield which he brought to the stock
market at the end of last year, says that since several of Chelsfield's
non-executive directors are based overseas, he had been keen to recruit
someone based in the United Kingdom.
