FT  23 JUL 93 / People: Batchelor moves into higher gear at Vauxhall


After seven years spent as executive director, sales and marketing, of
General Motors' Vauxhall cars subsidiary, the affable Peter Batchelor is
having his responsibilities broadened to embrace all aspects of sales and
after-sales care.
The title of vice chairman, commercial operations, goes with the 55-year-old
Batchelor's new overall responsibility for service, parts and accessories as
well as sales and marketing.
Taking over his old title is Ian Coomber, 48, also no stranger to a Vauxhall
dealer network well pleased with their franchise these days, despite the
relatively poor market.
Both Batchelor and Coomber - the latter until now retail and fleet sales
director - have played significant roles in Vauxhall's rise from a market
share languishing around 8 per cent at the start of the 1980s to more than
double that level now.
Coomber will join Peter Lord, director of after-sales, in reporting directly
to Batchelor.
