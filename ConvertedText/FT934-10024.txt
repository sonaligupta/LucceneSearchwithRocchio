FT  08 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: Tesco hires Costain for design and
build


COSTAIN ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION is to design and build two new
superstores for Tesco Stores.
The first store, in Exeter, is a 60,000 sq ft superstore on the Exevale
development site with parking for 625 cars and a petrol filling station.
The construction will be of traditional steel frame, with external brickwork
and pitched roofs, clad in clay tiles. A mural for the store is also planned
as part of a local art competition.
The contract involves site infrastructure works, with 3km of access roads,
sewers and trunk main services for the Exevale development.
Already located on the Exevale site are several grade II listed buildings
which are to receive remedial weatherproofing work from Costain. The
buildings are being improved for possible conversion into residential flats.
Work has already started on site and is expected to complete in August 1994.
The Carlisle store is a 45,000 sq ft superstore and petrol filling station,
with associated works and landscaping.
This requires diverting a stream, at present running across site, and
raising the store level above the existing flood plain.
Work has started on site and is expected to complete in June 1994.
