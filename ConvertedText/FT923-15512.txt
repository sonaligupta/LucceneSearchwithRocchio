FT  02 JUL 92 / Bush rules out lone US intervention in Bosnia


   By JUDY DEMPSEY


PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday ruled out unilateral US intervention in
war-torn Bosnia-Hercegovina, saying the problem was primarily European.
It would be unwise for the US 'to go ramming in as the sole perpetrator of
force', he said on a morning television chat show. 'What we've tried to do
is work with the United Nations,' he added.
Mr Bush spoke as western governments and relief agencies readied themselves
to mount a huge airlift of food to 300,000 inhabitants of the Bosnian
capital, Sarajevo, following an 86-day siege by Serb irregulars.
But 1,200 Canadian troops, due in Sarajevo to take control of the local
airport today, were being held up by minefields north-west of the city late
yesterday.
Secretary of state James Baker clarified the US position, saying the US was
ready to move swiftly to obtain a new UN Security Council resolution
authorising the use of force if necessary.
He added that the US would support a UN resolution authorising the use of
force to protect the relief mission if Serbian forces interfered.
Western diplomats are concerned that Sarajevo's small airport might prove
incapable of handling the volumes of food to be airlifted. They are
considering opening up a 125 mile land corridor from the port of Split. UN
