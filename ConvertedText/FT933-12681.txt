   By IAN RODGER


The Swiss Federal Banking Commission has exonerated Union Bank of
Switzerland, the country's largest bank, on charges that its chairman, Mr
Nikolaus Senn, assisted political pay-offs to the Italian Socialist party,
writes Ian Rodger. UBS said it had received a letter from the commission
confirming that nothing improper or illegal had been done.
