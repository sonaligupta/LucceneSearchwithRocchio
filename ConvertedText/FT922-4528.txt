FT  05 JUN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Green tyres ride over bicycle
pump


   By PAUL TAYLOR


Goodbye bicycle pump - it sounds like a cyclist's dream. A British company
has developed an innovative bike tyre which is impossible to puncture and is
environmentally friendly.
The Green Tyre, which is available in any colour and costs from Pounds 12.99
to Pounds 19.99, is a non-rubber tyre which will never go flat, is up to 30
per cent lighter than existing tyres and lasts substantially longer.
Made from micro-cellular polyurethane, all chemicals used in the Green Tyre
are non-carcinogenic and non-toxic. When they wear out they can even be
re-cycled. Green Tyre: UK, 0642 223322.
