FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zinc mines 'under acute stress'


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


ZINC MINES are suffering acute financial stress because of low prices for
the metal and because revenues from by-products such as lead and cadmium are
also seriously depressed, according to Mr David Humphreys, economist at RTZ
Corporation, the world's biggest mining company.
Prices for three metals languish at or near their lowest levels in real
terms. Some smelters, far from giving a financial credit for the cadmium
content of concentrate (an intermediate material), are imposing financial
penalties if it is present, he said.
So far this year cuts have been made at zinc mines owned by MIM, Pasminco
and Aztec Mining in Australia and by Noranda, Cominco, Curragh Resources and
RTZ in North America. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group predicts
mine output will fall this year by 6 per cent or more from the 1992 level.
But, because stocks of zinc concentrate are so large, this will not in
itself be enough to choke off production of refined metal from the smelters,
which have good financial reasons for continuing output at a high level.
Mr Humphreys said: 'Without further smelter cuts, zinc metal production is
on course for a further increase, largely from Latin America and non-Japan
Asia.'
If prices were to rise and stocks - at present representing more than 11
weeks' supply compared with the maximum of six weeks that the industry
needed - to fall, smelter production cuts were urgently required. 'Exchange
rates and the condition of the domestic market suggest that cuts will need
to be in Europe,' he said. In Europe 18 smelters, one third of the world
total, chased the same raw materials and the same customers.
