FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: GE Capital takes 20% stake in
ship management company


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


General Electric Capital Corporation has acquired a 20 per cent stake in V
Ships, a Monaco-based ship management company, in a move which is expected
to lead to increased investment by GE Capital in the shipping sector.
V Ships is one of the largest ship management companies, maintaining and
crewing vessels for their owners and, to a lesser extent, providing and
operating vessels for investors seeking to put funds into the shipping
sector. It has 150 ships under management.
The company is currently jointly owned by Vlasov Group, a shipowning
company, and by its own directors. Both will reduce their holdings to 40 per
cent.
The price of the transaction was not revealed.
GE Capital has historically provided leasing finance and subordinated loan
finance to the shipping industry, while it is also has a large container
leasing arm.
The demand for new vessels built to higher environmental standards,
including the provision of double-hulled tankers, and the ageing of the
present fleet is expected to lead to substantial new shipping investment
over the next few years.
An investment in V Ships will enable GE Capital to address these issues
better, the two companies said in a joint statement.
GE also expects to be able to pursue more extensive shipping projects,
normally involving investing in vessels under management.
News of the GE/V Ships deal comes within a few months of a spate of equity
issues by shipping companies in London, New York and Scandinavia.
