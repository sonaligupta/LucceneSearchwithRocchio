FT  19 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: British Columbia in Dollars
2bn EMTN launch


   By CONNER MIDDELMANN


The Canadian province of British Columbia plans to launch a Dollars 2bn Euro
medium-term note programme (EMTN) arranged by Lehman Brothers, a finance
ministry official said.
The programme, which is due to be launched in early to mid-May, is part of
an ongoing process of diversifying the province's borrowing sources and
broadening its investor base, said Mr Jim Hopkins, assistant director of
debt management at the finance ministry of British Columbia.
The dealer group will include Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, UBS, Goldman Sachs,
Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and SBC, he said.
British Columbia is a well-known name in the Eurobond market, which it first
used in 1983. Last year, it issued a CDollars 1.25bn global bond as well as
two Canadian dollar-denominated Eurobonds with maturities of 12 and 30
years. Its borrowing requirement for the financial year 1994-95 totals
CDollars 4.1bn, down from last year's CDollars 4.8bn.
British Columbia has the highest credit rating among Canada's provinces.
Standard & Poor's rates its long-term debt double-A-plus while Moody's
accords it a double-A-1 rating.
The Finnish Ministry of Finance has appointed arranger Morgan Stanley,
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, and UBS as dealers for its
Dollars 10bn Euroshelf for the issuance of debt instruments. The equivalent
of Dollars 4.3bn has been issued to date under the programme, which was
established in March 1993.
