FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Emap


In view of the judicial review being sought by Guardian Media Group
concerning Emap's offer for Trans World Communications, Emap said it was to
delay the posting of its offer document.
Emap will take a full part in the review, which is expected to be heard on
July 27.
The company will, subject to any ruling by the Takeover Panel, post its
offer document to Trans World shareholders within seven business days after
the judgment is given or by August 8, whichever is the sooner.
