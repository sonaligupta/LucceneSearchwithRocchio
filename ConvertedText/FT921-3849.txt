FT  12 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Leeds BS in Canadian dollar
paper programme


   By RICHARD WATERS


LEEDS Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, has become the
first to launch a Canadian dollar commercial paper programme, marking a
further step by the societies to move away from their traditional UK
investor base.
The Leeds also announced it was to launch a Ecu2bn medium-term note
programme. Together, the two will greatly expand the society's foreign
currency fund-raising, which is currently equivalent to Pounds 3bn.
The Leeds, like other large UK societies, has taken steps recently to
develop relationships with overseas investors to reduce its reliance on its
traditional sterling investors.
The move into foreign currencies has also been stimulated by a change in
regulations announced in December. These allow societies to hold liquid
assets in currencies other than sterling for the first time.
Mr Ian Stewart, capital markets manager at the Leeds, said proceeds from the
Canadian dollar programme would either be swapped into sterling or used to
invest in high-grade Canadian or US dollar paper.
'This will help to diversify both on the asset and liability sides,' said Mr
Stewart. 'Our aim is not to become overly reliant on any one sector.'
The Leeds has a funding requirement of Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m a year, he
said, around half of it due to the need to refinance existing deals.
UK building societies have only been permitted to raise money on the
wholesale markets since 1986, and have developed a real presence overseas in
the US dollar, which was first tapped in the late 1980s by the two leaders,
Halifax and Abbey National (which has since given up mutual status to become
a bank).
The Leeds' long-term debt is rated AA3 by Moody's, while its short-term
paper is rated A1/P1. Its Canadian dollar paper has a rating of R1 (Middle)
from Dominion Bond Rating Service.
