PHILIPS, of the Netherlands, and Grundig, its 32 per cent-owned German
consumer electronics associate company, said yesterday they intend to set up
joint ventures in the fields of video equipment and cordless telephones.
The video venture will encompass the development and production of video
components such as video heads, scanners and video tape-decks.
Grundig, which has been controlled by Philips since 1984, will contribute
its Nuremberg-based video operation to the venture, while the Dutch company
will include its entire Vienna-based video business group.
A Philips spokesman said that details, including the precise split in share
ownership, still had to be settled. No turnover figures were disclosed, but
Grundig's video operations employ 1,900 people and Philips' 3,000.
The components and equipment made by the venture will be sold under the
separate brand names Philips and Grundig. They will also be sold to other
original equipment manufacturers for relabelling.
The aim of the video partnership is to make better use of production and
research facilities.
