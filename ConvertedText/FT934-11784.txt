FT  29 OCT 93 / GM cuts its net loss to Dollars 113m in third quarter

GENERAL Motors, which is battling to return its US vehicle operations to
profit, yesterday reported a Dollars 113m (Pounds 76.5m) third-quarter net
loss after adding Dollars 950m pre-tax to reserves for its extensive North
American plant closing programme.
The third quarter saw the group significantly cut losses in the North
American vehicle market, though these remain heavy. Internationally, a
strong performance in Latin America offset lower profits in recession-hit
Europe.
Wall Street analysts said the figures were surprisingly strong and showed
steady progress in turning around North America. GM shares closed up Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 49.
The net loss, which is equivalent to 49 cents a share, compared with a loss
of Dollars 1.1bn, or Dollars 1.86 a share, in the same period of 1992. Sales
and revenues rose 2.4 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 30.2bn.
The latest results were affected by three special items. One was the plant
closings charge, announced on Monday, which worked through at Dollars 589m
after tax. Another was a Dollars 144m charge for costs relating to the new
labour contract the company agreed with the United Auto Workers union over
the weekend. These Dollars 733m of charges were partly offset by the Dollars
444m positive effect of a change in the US corporate income tax rate.
GM's troubled North American automotive operations produced a net loss of
Dollars 1.12bn, including special items, down from a loss of Dollars 1.88bn
last year. The company believed its North American operations could
break-even in 1993.
