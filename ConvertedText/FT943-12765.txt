FT  22 JUL 94 / Two sentenced in Japan bribe case

   TOKYO


A Japanese court gave two former officials of a construction company
suspended prison terms yesterday for bribing a regional governor to win a
contract, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
The Tokyo district court verdict was the first conviction of executives in a
string of construction scandals. More than a dozen officials from various
companies and several local government leaders have been arrested on
suspicion of corruption since last year.
The Tobishima executives were found guilty of handing Y10m (Dollars 101,300)
to Fujio Takeuchi, then governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, at a Tokyo
restaurant on January 25, 1991.
The money was in return for Takeuchi granting Tobishima part of a Y38bn dam
project at Oyama near Tokyo, the court said.
Sukemasa Uera, 86, former honourary chairman of Tobishima, was given a
suspended prison term of two years. His son Soichiro Uera, 59, former
vice-president, was sentenced to one year and six months, also suspended.
Presiding Judge Kenjiro Tao said their criminal liability was serious, given
the effects of their action on society. But he said the sentences were
suspended because the two men had repented.
Mr Takeuchi, 76, is being tried separately.
