FT  13 NOV 93 / Pensions group lobbies chancellor


THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds has lobbied 200 MPs in an effort
to head off threatened Budget changes to the taxation of pension funds.
Employee contributions to pensions are tax-deductible at present, and
employees are entitled to a tax-free lump sum on retirement.
There has been speculation that the chancellor might attack some of these
privileges. The association argues that taxing pension funds 'would increase
the cost to employers providing final salary schemes'.
