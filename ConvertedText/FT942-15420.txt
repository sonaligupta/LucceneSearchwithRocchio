FT  15 APR 94 / Court clarifies law on job transfers


   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent


The contracting-out of services performed by only one employee is covered by
European Union employment protection rules, the European Court of Justice
has ruled.
The Luxembourg Court's ruling yesterday that the European Acquired Rights
Directive can apply to the contracting-out of cleaning services done by one
employee will affect government policy on contracting out public-sector
services.
The directive, which was enshrined in UK law by the Transfer of Undertakings
(Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known as Tupe, protects
employees' jobs and conditions when the business they work for changes
hands.
Confusion over whether such protection applies to contracting out has cast
doubt on the government's compulsory competitive tendering and
market-testing programmes.
Employment lawyers said the court's confirmation that the directive had a
broad application would disappoint contractors and the UK government.
Ms Melanie Tether, a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose, said the court
appeared to have pushed the frontiers of the directive further forward by
ruling that all that was needed for it to apply was for the contractor to be
carrying out the same type of work as performed before the transfer.
It rejected the UK and German governments' argument that for the directive
to apply, there had to be a transfer of assets to the contractor.
European Union social policy should concentrate on disseminating best
practice 'rather than choking off job creation and hindering EU
competitiveness', according to the government's formal response to the
European Commission's green paper on social policy.
It says the green paper should not form the basis of a new round of social
legislation.
