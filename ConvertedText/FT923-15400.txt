FT  02 JUL 92 / Hopes for recovery hit in Australia


   By EMILIA TAGAZA

AUSTRALIA'S slow recovery from recession is showing signs of stalling,
putting increased pressure on the government to cut interest rates again,
writes Emilia Tagaza in Canberra.
Three sets of indicators published yesterday indicate that growth will fall
short of the government's annual target of around 4 per cent between 1992
and 1995.
Building approvals fell in May by 4.5 per cent, seasonally adjusted on the
previous month's figures. The fall followed moderate rises in March and
April.
New car registrations also fell nearly 4 per cent in May. This was the
second successive monthly decline, despite the reduced sales tax on cars
introduced by the government last February.
The May current account deficit rose 20 per cent on the previous month's
shortfall to ADollars 1.1bn (Pounds 440m), seasonally adjusted. This was the
highest monthly deficit since November last year. The increase was due
mainly to a 5 per cent fall in exports.
