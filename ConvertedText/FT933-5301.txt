FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: Banks battle to advise on Tofas


   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN


   ANKARA


SCHRODERS, the UK merchant bank, and Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US bank,
are bidding to advise the Turkish government on the sale of its 22 per cent
stake in Tofas, the local Fiat subsidiary, in what would be the largest
international listing of a leading Turkish company, writes John Murray Brown
in Ankara.
The banks were yesterday in negotiations in Ankara with the Public
Participation Administration (PPA), the government agency handling state
sales to the public. A decision on the sale is expected shortly.
The PPA is considering plans for either a share listing on the New York
Stock Exchange or a direct placement to US institutions.
The issue would be worth Dollars 600m at current prices, and would give a
buyer a stake in Turkey's largest car business. The government hopes to
conclude the deal this year.
