FT  05 MAR 94 / Court demands Pounds 34,000 for deliberate radioactive leak


Nuclear Electric was yesterday fined a total of Pounds 34,000 for
deliberately leaking radioactive gas into the atmosphere.
The case, the first prosecution of its type in Britain, followed an incident
at the Wylfa magnox power station in An-glesey, north Wales, last July.
Magistrates at Amlwch, Anglesey, also ordered Nuclear Electric, which
admitted two charges under the Radioactive Substances Act 1960, to pay costs
of Pounds 20,170.
Mr Martin Warren, for HM Inspectorate of Pollution, said sulphur and carbon
gas leaked after a 130lb grab on a refuelling machine fell nearly 40ft,
landing close to a fuel rod of radioactive uranium.
An air sample from the building showed the radiation level nine times above
an internal action level. Some air was released into the atmosphere over two
hours. A few hours later, internal radioactivity being more than five times
above the action level, a further amount of air was released, Mr Warren
said. Power station staff released the gas without considering the
information available, and did not know the wind direction or the potential
for serious environmental harm, he added.
Mr Wyn Lloyd Jones, for Nuclear Electric, said the company reported the gas
release immediately. Mr Mike Williams, Wylfa station manager, said yesterday
that it was a minor breach and there was no hazard to the population or the
workforce.
