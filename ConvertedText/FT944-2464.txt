FT  16 DEC 94 / Insurers, advisers warned on pensions advice


   By ALISON SMITH


Life companies and independent advisers will face disciplinary action if
they fail to carry out the regulators' plans for identifying and
compensating victims of poor advice on buying personal pensions, if
proposals put forward yesterday go ahead, Alison Smith writes.
The Personal Investment Authority, the watchdog to protect the private
investor, intends to change its rules so that anyone it regulates who does
not follow the procedures on time will be in breach of its requirements.
A consultation paper from the regulator also suggests relaxing the rules
imposing strict limits on the benefits life offices can give independent
advisers. In October a blueprint for reviewing the hundreds of thousands of
personal pensions sold since 1988 was set out by the Securities and
Investments Board, the City's chief regulator.
Its plan was drawn up after a detailed study found that poor advice had been
given during the selling of personal pensions on a far greater scale than
had previously been thought.
The PIA has set up a pensions unit which will handle cases where the adviser
has gone out of business. Half the estimated Pounds 3m cost will be met
through fees paid by all PIA member companies, with the rest falling on
companies which sold personal pensions through independent advisers.
