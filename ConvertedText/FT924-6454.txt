LAURENTIAN GROUP, a Montreal-based financial services conglomerate, recorded
third-quarter profits of CDollars 9.5m (USDollars 7.4m), or 16 cents a
share, up 13 per cent from CDollars 8.4m, or 14 cents, a year earlier.
Results from its general insurance subsidiary improved.
Nine months' profit was CDollars 23.8m, or 39 cents a share, down nearly 9
per cent from CDollars 26.1m, or 45 cents, a year earlier. The 1991 period
included a special gain of CDollars 2.5m from the sale of a British
affiliate. Nine months' revenues were CDollars 2.1bn, up 7 per cent.
Corporate assets at September 30 were CDollars 14.4bn, up 5 per cent from
December 31 1991 and including assets under administration, the total was
CDollars 20.9bn, up 6 per cent. The gain in corporate assets was due mainly
to expansion by Laurentian Bank.
Teck, an internationally-owned diversified mining group, is expected to take
over the Baler and Greenhills coal mines in southern British Columbia from
the bankrupt Westar Mining. Teck bid CDollars 85m, with the backing of the
Bank of Montreal, Westar's largest secured creditor.
