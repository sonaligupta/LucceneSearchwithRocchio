FT  17 JAN 92 / Inflation at five-year low


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


MODERATE price increases in December left US inflation at 3.1 per cent in
1991, its lowest rate for five years.
The Labour Department said yesterday its index of consumer prices rose by
0.1 per cent in December, or 0.3 per cent after seasonal adjustment.
The low inflation rate in 1991 was much helped by a 7.4 per cent drop in
energy prices (compared with an 18.1 per cent rise in 1990), but inflation
in almost all sectors stayed moderate. Food prices rose only 2.5 per cent,
their slowest advance since 1976.
The main exception was medical care, where prices rose by 7.9 per cent in
1991. There is a long-established pattern of this outstripping general
consumer price inflation.
Other components of the index to rise sharply included alcoholic drinks,
which climbed 9.9 per cent largely as a result of higher federal excise
taxes; tobacco products, up 11.1 per cent; and school tuition and fees, up
9.8 per cent.
The seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent December price increase was slightly
higher than private-sector economists had been forecasting, but it remained
relatively modest.
