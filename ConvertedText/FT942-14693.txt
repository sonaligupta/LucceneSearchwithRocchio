FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Chase exceeds expectations


   By RICHARD WATERS


   NEW YORK


After-tax earnings at Chase Manhattan comfortably exceeded market
expectations during the first quarter as the bank recorded profits on a
series of asset disposals.
Net income for the first quarter was more than double the Dollars 153m, or
74 cents a share, recorded in the first period of 1993.
The disposals, which included real estate assets, loans to developing
countries and so-called 'Brady bonds', helped push net earnings for the
period to Dollars 364m, or Dollars 1.80 a share, compared with market
expectations of around Dollars 1.15 a share.
Trading revenues, at Dollars 179m, against Dollars 175m a year earlier, were
boosted by the sale of loans made to countries which had not reached a debt
restructuring agreement, mainly Brazil.
'Several hundred million' dollars of these loans had been switched into the
bank's trading account at the end of last year, said Mr Michel Kruse, chief
financial officer. Most of the disposals were made during the first weeks of
the year, before prices on such loans traded in the secondary market fell,
he added.
The bank also recorded a Dollars 53m profit from selling real estate assets
held in its accelerated disposition portfolio. These sales also reduced the
carrying value of remaining assets in the portfolio to Dollars 121m.
A further Dollars 79m gain came from selling investment securities, up from
Dollars 6m a year before, as Chase disposed of Brady bonds, securities
issued by developing countries which have reached debt restructuring
agreements with their foreign bank creditors.
