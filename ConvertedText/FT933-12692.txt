FT  23 JUL 93 / Business confidence growing


   By ARIANE GENILLARD

BUSINESS confidence is improving among German managers, who see the
recession as bottoming out, according to a report by Ifo, the Munich
economic institute.
The study, which each month questions 500 managers in Germany's largest
companies, says the business community is now less pessimistic over
prospects for the German economy. An increasing number of businessmen think
that economic activity has reached its lowest level and will not decline
further in the next six months, the report says.
Industrial orders in June remained at the same level as the previous month,
arresting this year's downward trend. However, Ifo notes that production
cuts will continue as German industry faces low domestic demand and
continuing restructuring.
The report says unsold stocks remain high and businessmen expect prices to
fall in coming months.
The outlook differs in various sectors of the economy. In the chemical
sector, export-driven growth is expected because of the strong dollar.
Machinery producers remain pessimistic about the domestic market but also
say that export possibilities will increase in coming months. Similar views
are expressed in the motor industry.
Exceptions are found in the construction industry and in retailing in
western Germany, but their counterparts in the east say business is picking
up and are optimistic over the future market potential.
