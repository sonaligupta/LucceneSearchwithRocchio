FT  13 APR 94 / Maxmin to leave Laura Ashley


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


Laura Ashley is to part ways with its outspoken chief executive, Mr Jim
Maxmin, the American recruited in 1991 to revive the flagging fortunes of
the quintessentially British fashion retailer.
The company announced yesterday that Mr Maxmin would resign in May. It said
his departure followed a disagreement over investment levels. The shares
shed 4p to close at 81p.
Many in the City credited Mr Maxmin with putting the brand-led company back
on track, after plunging into the red in 1990, through rebuilding morale and
deals such as a distribution arrangement with Federal Express. However, his
style did not sit well with others.
One analyst said Mr Maxmin was 'full of business school jargon, a typical
marketing man'.
Some suggested that his strengths lay in strategic planning. 'He was a
concept man,' said another analyst. 'But I was never really sure about the
attention to detail.' This view was reinforced last September when the group
warned profits would be Pounds 7m lower than expectations due to losses in
the US.
The company refused to comment further on Mr Maxmin's departure, but it is
believed the dispute had been simmering for some time. Some analysts thought
Mr Maxmin had wanted to invest heavily in brand marketing. 'They need to
build their profits before they can embark on such a programme,' said one
analyst. Laura Ashley said pre-tax profits, to be announced on Thursday,
would be in line with expectations of about Pounds 3m, against Pounds 1.8m.
Mr Maxmin was on a two-year rolling contract with annual remuneration of
Pounds 310,000.
