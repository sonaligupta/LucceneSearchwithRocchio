FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting planned by
Tabacalera after 61% fall


   By TOM BURNS


   MADRID


TABACALERA, Spain's government-controlled tobacco group, reported a 61 per
cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Pta6.4bn (Dollars 46.8m) for
the first nine months. It is to introduce a cost-cutting programme to
improve its balance sheet.
The profits plunge was blamed on an increase in contraband tobacco,
competition from imported lower-priced brands, and the increased cost of raw
materials following the peseta's depreciation.
Tabacalera, which intends to shed 500 jobs under early retirement schemes,
said it hoped to save more than Pta1bn before the end of this year through
spending cuts.
The latest figures disguised signs of improvement in the group's sales,
thanks to a recent government crackdown on tobacco smuggling.
Sales fell by 10 per cent against the first nine months of last year. In
September this year, when anti-contraband legislation came into force, sales
fell by just over 1 per cent against September 1992.
Tabacalera did not consolidate the food group Royal Brands, 50 per cent of
which was sold to RJR Nabisco of the US in July.
The Spanish group, which hopes Nabisco will buy Royal Brands outright next
year, said it considered its remaining 50 per cent stake in the food
division to be a 'short-term' investment.
