FT  03 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Rolls-Royce


Since Rolls-Royce made great play of its strong balance sheet when it cut
its dividend in March, it is perhaps a little surprising to find the same
directors announcing a rights issue six months later. In part, it can be
explained by the fact that Rolls' balance sheet, while perfectly formed, is
small. The more sinister explanation, however, is that cash is flowing out
of the company at a worryingly high rate, as the business is rationalised,
customers defer orders and stage payments, and working capital and stocks
rise.
While the company insists that the situation is under control, raising
Pounds 307m certainly buys a fair amount of insurance. The pain of the
downturn is thus being felt by shareholders. That might feel a little more
palatable if investors had enjoyed the full fruits of the upturn. Yet Rolls
used that opportunity to build market share on very thin margins - a
strategy which has yet to yield higher margin follow-on or spares business.
The capital expenditure programme to update and expand the range of engines
continues to prove expensive. Rolls may have little choice if it is to
remain competitive. However reassuring its order book, the business is
balanced on a thin base when compared to giants such as General Electric.
Yet that places investors in a difficult position. Rolls' shares have
struggled to rise above the issue price for most of the time since
flotation. Yesterday's action is unlikely to change that.
