FT  12 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Germany offers detachment from
US woes


   By Our Markets Staff


Bourses suffered again from nervousness over falling US stock and bond
prices, but there was belated evidence that Germany could offer a degree of
detachment, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT extended Thursday's post bourse losses, ending with the Dax index
37.61 down on the session and 21.02 lower than its overnight close at
2,103.49. Turnover fell from DM9bn to DM8.2bn.
However, there were two points of encouragement. The offical close was 2.1
per cent higher on the week; and the Ibis indicated Dax held up well in the
afternoon, closing at 2,101.89 although Wall Street had another weak
morning.
Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that as the IG Metall
wage settlement boosted German equities on Monday, yesterday's agreement
with the public workers' union, OeTV, gave equities some support after
hours.
Viag, as expected, was not popular. The terms of Thursday's deal to buy
Bayernwerk from the Bavarian government left the shares DM31.50, or 6.4 per
cent lower at DM458.50.
MILAN was led higher by telecoms as the Comit index added 1.52 to 665.26 for
a 1.9 per cent rise over the week. The mood, however, remained restrained
ahead of elections at the end of the month and the end of the account next
week.
Sip added L171 or 2.9 per cent to L4,534, for a two-day rise of 8.4 per
cent, after news that the government will reduce its license fee to
compensate for its loss of the mobile telephone monopoly. Stet added L89 to
L4,906 and Italcable L174 to L10,716, on news that the telecoms companies
are to meet next Saturday to decide on conversion rates for their shares
ahead of the privatisation of the sector.
Parmalat shed L96 or 3.9 per cent to L2,352 as plans to raise up to L500bn
in bonds over the next five years raised worries that the company might be
trying to grow too fast.
PARIS balanced rights and convertible issue news against a slight cut in
overnight rates and came out with the CAC-40 index down 9.67 at 2,174.91 for
a fractional decline on the week. Turnover was FFr4bn.
Dealers pounced on Paribas after its rights issue news, and the shares lost
FFr14.10 at FFr491.90. Eurotunnel fared even worse, down FFr3, or nearly 6
per cent at FFr48 on reports that its passenger service might not open until
after the summer holiday season.
Elsewhere, Michelin fell FFr8.40 to FFr251 on US selling and TF1, the TV
channel, by FFr16.50 to FFr498.50 after a big block trade.
ZURICH lost 1 per cent, the SMI index falling 29.6 to 2,831.6 for a 1.2 per
cent drop on the week.
Banks saw further foreign selling. SBC shed SFr11 to SFr424 and UBS bearers
were SFr14 down at SFr1,230.4.
Cyclicals, however, continued to find favour with Brown Boveri another SFr8
higher at SFr1,179, in further response to Thursday's results. Sulzer added
SFr19 to a year's high of SFr1,039.
Nestle shed SFr16 to SFr1,247: Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock, saying
that the discount of the shares to equivalent international issues had been
eliminated as the stock had significantly outperformed the S & P food index.
AMSTERDAM combined the weakening dollar and falling bonds in a downbeat mood
that sent the AEX sliding 4.67 to 417.63, an improvement of 0.8 per cent
over the week.
But there was also a feeling that the market is poised for an upswing on
strong corporate results. Heineken, which pleased the market after the close
of trading on Thursday, bounced Fl 3.20 to Fl 232.50.
STOCKHOLM was knocked by higher debt market yields at home and lower
equities abroad. The Affarsvarlden General Index slid 22.7 to 1501.6, a fall
of 0.7 per cent on the week.
Ericsson B moved the index with a fall in of SKr16 to SKr343. The decline
continued in early Wall St trading.
Volvo B fell SKr14 to SKr669 over doubts on its cross ownership deal with
Renault.
OSLO fell 1.5 per cent as Norsk Hydro unexpectedly unveiled a rights issue
to raise up to NKr5bn. The all-share index fell 9.88 to 654.97 in active
turnover of NKr653m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr11 to NKr243 although the minority
Labour government said that it planned to maintain its 51 per cent stake and
participate in the issue.
ISTANBUL was boosted by a flurry of buying in a market that had fallen 12
per cent in the previous four days. The bargain hunting pushed up the
composite index up 779.92 to 14,511.25, a fall of 6.9 per cent on the week.
But bearish feeling remained with some dealers feeling that the surge was
premature. Most of the buying interest centred on sectors unlikely to be
affected by currency fluctuations.
