FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Ercros future depends on talks
with creditor banks


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


THE struggle to save Ercros, Spain's largest chemicals group, moved a step
closer to resolution last night when its board decided not to file for
protection from creditors and to risk its future on a series of negotiations
with creditor banks today.
Mr Jose Piquet, Ercros' managing director, said last night that he had ruled
out a suspension of payments. 'If we do not get new funds this company will
last only a few days more,' he added.
Ercros, 40 per cent owned by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), employs
10,500 people in chemicals, mining, fertiliser and explosives businesses. It
owes banks and suppliers more than Dollars 1bn, half of which matures this
year.
The KIO has made clear it is prepared to see Ercros go bankrupt rather than
make new funds available without parallel assistance from other shareholders
and the Spanish government.
Officials close to the company said that a meeting with the Industry
Ministry in Madrid had gone 'very well' and that the government had
indicated that it was prepared to try to help the company, although it could
not make new funds available.
While no promises have been made, the company seems to interpret this to
mean Madrid will try to intercede on Ercros' behalf to slow the flood of
imported fertilisers into the country and to pressure the state-controlled
Banco Exterior, the group's largest creditor with Dollars 200m of loans
outstanding, to be helpful in renegotiating the debt today.
