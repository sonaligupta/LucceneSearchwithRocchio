FT  05 AUG 93 / International Company News: Highveld Steel ahead at halfway


   By PHILIP GAWITH


HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, a subsidiary of Anglo American Industrial
Corporation, increased first-half attributable earnings by 21 per cent from
R31m to R37.6m (Dollars 11.2m) after benefiting from a R10m deferred tax
adjustment.
Operating profit, however, fell to R34.07m from R35.9m a year earlier
despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover to R737.4m, reflecting the
difficult market conditions.
The interim dividend was maintained at 20 cents a share on a 21 per cent
improvement in earnings per share to 42.5 cents, from 35.1 cents a year ago.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said an end to inventory corrections by steel
stockists and new projects had helped local steel sales increase by nearly
10 per cent over the same period in 1992.
Mr Boyd predicted that firmer dollar prices for export steel and ferro-alloy
products, and a weaker rand, should allow a 'moderate' increase in
second-half earnings over the first six months.
The vanadium market, however, continues to be difficult. Prices have fallen
to a level last seen during the recessionary period of 1982-83.
