FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Danish plan by Budgens with Pounds 1.5m
bakery buy


   By PETER PEARSE


THE MEN who turned round a German supermarket business before being given
the helm at a faltering British food retailing chain, are now keen to
develop a continental-type bakery in a bolt-on acquisition and expect
shortly to hire a Danish master baker.
Budgens has bought family-managed Gilsons The Bakers for about Pounds 1m and
is assuming banking liabilities of about Pounds 500,000.
This is not the first bakery operation with which Budgens' Mr John von
Spreckelsen, Mr Christian Williams, and Mr Graham Rigby - respectively chief
executive, director and finance director - have been involved. Before the
Budgens call, they revived the fortunes of Kafu Wasmund, the Bremen-based
chain of supermarkets, which included a bakery business. Mr Williams will
become Gilsons' chairman.
Founded soon after the turn of the century, Gilsons is based near Heathrow.
Its customers already include 15 of Budgens' 96 stores, as well as other
supermarkets, catering companies and Gilsons' two retail outlets.
Currently about 40 per cent of its Pounds 3.4m turnover is to the catering
trade, and when the acquisition is complete, it will supply some 30 Budgens
stores. In 1991, operating profits were about Pounds 350,000.
Gilsons' traditional British baking will be maintained, but one of Denmark's
20,000 qualified master bakers will be employed to spice up and add to the
operation, especially the pastries side.
