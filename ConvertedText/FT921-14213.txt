FT  17 JAN 92 / Nissan freezes Lima output

   TOKYO


NISSAN has suspended work at its car assembly plant in Peru, it said
yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Japan's second-largest vehicle maker had produced finished cars in Lima,
when Peru's 50 per cent tariff on finished cars made marketing of imported
cars there prohibitively expensive. But since Peru cut that tariff to 15 per
cent last year, it has become cheaper to import finished cars than to
assemble them locally from imported parts, the company noted.
Nissan said suspension of work at the plant, in effect since last October,
did not necessarily mean the permanent shut-down of production in Peru, But
a start-up of production at the plant was unlikely in the near future.
In 1982, at the peak of production, the company said its plant in Peru
assembled roughly 9,500 vehicles, largely small passenger cars and trucks.
In May last year, Toyota Japan's largest car maker, also suspended its
vehicle-assembling operation in Lima.
