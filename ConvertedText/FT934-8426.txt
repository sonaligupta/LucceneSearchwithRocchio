FT  16 NOV 93 / Broad welcome for move on Trident


   By DAVID OWEN


GOVERNMENT plans to restrict the size of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent
were broadly welcomed by MPs yesterday although some senior Tories were more
cautious, David Owen writes.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee, said Trident
was a 'sane' place to look for defence savings.
But he said the move left questions about the number of missiles and
warheads the armed forces would have in reserve and on how easily the policy
could be reversed.
Labour welcomed the move, which it said it had been advocating for the last
four years.
Mr Menzies Campbell, for the Liberal Democrats, said it showed 'some belated
commonsense'.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will today announce the new policy,
under which the UK is to commit itself to deploying a total explosive power
no greater than the present generation of Polaris ballistic missile
submarines.
