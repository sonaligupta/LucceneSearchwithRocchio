FT  12 NOV 92 / Argentine debt plan ready soon

ARGENTINA'S debt reduction plan will be ready for signing in the first week
of December, according to Mr Domingo Cavallo, Economy Minister. The
programme was restructured after banks opted for only one of the two debt
reduction instruments, delaying the signing by three months.
Argentina originally offered to convert Dollars 23bn in commercial bank debt
into two types of bond, underpinned by US Treasury zero coupon bonds. One of
the bonds reduces debt principal by 35 per cent, but pays floating interest
rates. The other bond pays lower, fixed interest rates while preserving the
full value of the original debt.
The steep fall in US interest rates has made the fixed interest par bonds
more attractive than floating rate discount bonds. Banks opted
overwhelmingly for fixed interest bonds, forcing international lending
agencies to demand a rebalancing.
The banks have now agreed to convert 65 per cent of their loans into par
bonds and raise to 35 per cent the share of discount bonds.
