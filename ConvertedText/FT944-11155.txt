FT  08 NOV 94 / Cubans swim home


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


Three months ago, they braved the Straits of Florida on makeshift rafts in a
bid to escape from Cuba to the US, reports George Graham in Washington. But
in a striking reversal this weekend, dozens of Cuban refugees, broke down
fences and leaped from a cliff into mine-strewn waters to swim back to Cuba
from the US military base at Guantanamo Bay. Fed up after languishing in the
camp since August, a group of 85 tried to flee, but only 39 made it to Cuba.
The rest were caught by US troops and returned. In all, about 32,000 Cubans
are interned at Guantanamo, which the US still leases from Cuba, and in
Panama.
