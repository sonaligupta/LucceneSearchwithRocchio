   BONN


A German minister has called off a visit to Turkey in protest against the
treatment of the Kurdish minority, according to the Sunday newspaper Bild am
Sonntag, Reuter reports from Bonn. It said Mr Norbert Blum, labour minister,
had written to his Turkish counterpart, Mr Mehmet Mogultay, cancelling a
visit scheduled for May. Bild quoted Mr Blum as saying in his letter no
state ruled by law should punish civilians for the activities of terrorists,
a reference to clashes between security forces and Kurdish separatists. No
comment was immediately available from Mr Blum's ministry.
