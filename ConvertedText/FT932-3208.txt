FT  15 JUN 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks lend Pounds 80m to
property group


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


LONDON & Cambridge Properties, the privately-owned investment property group
based in Dudley, West Midlands, has arranged an Pounds 80m loan from a
syndicate of eight banks led by Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden.
Bank financing of property investment on this scale has been rare since the
UK market turned down after the increase in values during the 1980s. The
equity market has tended to be the main source of funding, through a series
of rights issues for companies either strengthening weakened balance sheets
or seeking funds for expansion.
It is estimated that there are now only 40 banks willing to lend to property
companies, compared with 150 during the 1980s.
Mr John Davis, managing director of LCP, suggested that while banks were
wary of property development, some were willing to lend on well-let
investment properties.
The LCP loan is for five years.
