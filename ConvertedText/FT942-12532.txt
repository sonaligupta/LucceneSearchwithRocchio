FT  29 APR 94 / Cleaning deal is boost for job rules


   By JOHN AUTHERS


ISS Cleaning Services, the world's largest cleaning company, yesterday
signed a landmark agreement recognising Unison, the UK's largest
public-sector union.
The move signals a shift in contractors' attitude to Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, known as Tupe. These
rules, where they are held to apply, oblige companies which tender
successfully for public-sector contracts to take on existing workforces with
unchanged pay and conditions.
Contractors have opposed the regulations, but acceptance that Tupe applies
is written into the deal with Unison.
Mr Martin O'Halloran, managing director of ISS, said the move would help
change the image of cleaning as a 'low-wage, low-quality industry'.
Mr Roger Poole, Unison assistant general secretary, said the deal was a
'major breakthrough' which would help create a 'well-paid, well-trained and
well-motivated workforce'.
Rival contractors are unlikely immediately to follow ISS by recognising
Unison. But the Clause 26 Group, which represents most of the largest
contractors, including ISS, also decided yesterday to change its stance on
Tupe. It told a meeting of Conservative MPs yesterday it was prepared to
accept that Tupe covered competitive tendering for local government and
health service contracts.
However, Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, director of Clause 26, said that in these
circumstances the government could only gain savings from competitive
tendering by adopting the more radical model used in France. This would
involve all contracts being awarded to external companies, although they
would use the same workforce. If existing managers wanted to maintain their
role they would be forced to set up their own companies to bid for the
contract.
