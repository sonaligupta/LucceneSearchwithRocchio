FT  30 MAR 92 / Media spotlight turned on to Clinton's rival


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


MR Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, has made hay with the
travails of his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr Bill
Clinton, quoting or misquoting every press investigation into Mr Clinton's
record as governor of Arkansas and dubbing him the 'scandal a week'
candidate.
But Mr Brown's sudden rise to prominence after he narrowly defeated Mr
Clinton in last week's Democratic primary in Connecticut has also turned the
investigative spotlight on his own record.
The Washington Post reported that Mr Brown had accepted a Dollars
20,000-a-year board seat on a bio-medical company whose parent had to pay a
Dollars 400,000 fine to settle charges that it had falsely promoted a drug
as a treatment for the HIV virus and Mr Brown said he had telephoned a
prominent congressman to intercede on the company's behalf.
The story not only turns back against Mr Brown the charges of
influence-peddling that he has levelled at anyone within firing range, but
also carries a double edge because of the prominence with which the
Californian politician displays his sympathy with Aids victims, in the shape
of a red ribbon in his buttonhole.
While the Washington Post report contains no evidence of any kind of
wrong-doing or even ethically questionable conduct by Mr Brown, it is
exactly the same kind of story that has dripped inexorably on Mr Clinton,
eroding his apparent invincibility.
Mr Brown, however, continues to wage unabashed warfare against Mr Clinton in
the run-up to tomorrow's Vermont primary and to the high-stakes primaries in
New York, Wisconsin and Kansas on April 7.
But Mr Clinton still has 1,013 of the 4,288 delegates who will meet at the
party's nominating convention in July committed to him, compared to only 152
for Mr Brown.
