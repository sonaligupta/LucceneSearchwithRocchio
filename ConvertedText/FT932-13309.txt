FT  23 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese renege on wool
contracts as prices dive

THE CRISIS in Australia's wool market deepened this week, with prices
hitting a new low and the biggest overseas buyers starting to renege on
earlier contracts.
The wool market indicator, the weighted average of auction prices of 15 wool
categories, yesterday fell to ADollars 3.96 a kilogram, the first time the
indicator has dropped below the the ADollars 4 mark.
Brokers said that Chinese and Korean buyers, who were buying strongly
earlier this week, yesterday kept away from the market.
Meanwhile, a delegation from the Australian Council of Wool Exporters has
flown to China, the biggest importer of Australian wool, to try to persuade
individual buyers to stop reneging on wool purchases contracted when prices
were higher.
Government officials say that the extent of losses from dishonoured
contracts is not known but the Chinese buyers' action is giving 'cause for
concern' in the government. The Wool Export Council has asked the federal
government to put pressure on the Chinese government.
The council's Mr Don Booth said that the Chinese buyers' action was totally
unacceptable and warned that it would diminish their country's standing in
the international wool market.
Mr Simon Crean, the primary industries minister, is expected to propose to
the cabinet next week an emergency aid package to wool growers, including
interest rate subsidies and generous debt re-scheduling arrangements.
