FT  05 AUG 93 / Libya invitation to UN may lead to Lockerbie trial


   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS at the UN


   NEW YORK


LIBYA has invited the United Nations to open talks that could lead to the
eventual trial of the two alleged Lockerbie bombers, a UN spokesman
announced last night, writes Michael Littlejohns at the UN in New York.
However, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, needed further
clarifications, including where the trial might be held and on the question
of compensation, before sending a mission to Tripoli.
Mr Omar Mustafa al-Muntasser, the Libyan foreign minister, with whom he
discussed the question in New York late on Tuesday, has returned to Tripoli
to consult his government on the points raised.
The Security Council imposed sanctions against Libya last year after Tripoli
refused to hand over two men accused of masterminding the December 1988
bombing of a PanAm jet over Lockerbie in Scotland with the loss of 270
lives.
