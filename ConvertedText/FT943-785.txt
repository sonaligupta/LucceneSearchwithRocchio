FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Plan to import Qatar gas approved


   By REUTER


   ISLAMABAD


The Economic Co-ordination Committee of the Pakistani cabinet has approved a
plan to import natural gas from Qatar, Reuter reports from Islamabad.
A government statement issued yesterday said the scheme provides for a
Dollars 3.2bn gas pipeline from Qatar to Pakistan.
Pakistani president Farooq Leghari said earlier this month after a visit to
Iran that Tehran had agreed to join the project. The first phase would
comprise a 1,600km pipeline and transmission facilities from a southern gas
field in Qatar to Pakistan.
The pipeline is planned to carry 1.6bn cubic feet of gas per day and later
to be extended to India. The gas pipeline project is being sponsored by
Sharjah-based Crescent Petroleum International, Canada's TransCanada
PipeLines, the leading gas transmission company, and Brown and Root, the US
engineering group.
The pipeline will carry gas offshore from Qatar across the lower Gulf to the
United Arab Emirates' west coast and overland across northern UAE to the
Gulf of Oman.
From there the pipeline will run along the coast of Iran to Pakistan,
terminating near Karachi.
The project will be financed by regional governments and the World Bank.
Earlier this month Iran and Pakistan agreed to build an oil refinery in
Pakistan and to export Iranian natural gas and refined oil products to
Pakistan.
