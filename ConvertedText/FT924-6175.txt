FT  23 NOV 92 / Letter: Exactitude in home improvement pay-back


   From Mr IVOR DUARTE


Sir, I must take David Lascelles to task for a serious arithmo-economic
inexactitude (Energy Efficiency survey: 'Overheated and under-insulated',
November 17). In assessing the pay-back time on his potential home
improvements, he has completely ignored 'opportunity cost' - that is, the
loss of interest on the capital expended. This is a basic economic factor,
and while one might tolerate such a naive approach from a DIY magazine, not
the FT please]
In the examples given, if his total investment is Pounds 3,010 then the lost
interest, even at only 7 per cent, amount to Pounds 210 a year. This means
that the true saving is Pounds 306 at the moment, not Pounds 516, and the
pay-back time is not less than six years, it is more than 10. If capital is
borrowed, the return will probably be negative.
Reasonable insulation improvements are indeed desirable and usually
economical, the notable exception being double-glazing, for which the
pay-back time - after opportunity cost - is never.
