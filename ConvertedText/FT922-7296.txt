FT  19 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cabinet committee list due for
release


   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN


MINISTERS will today start to unravel the secrecy surrounding Whitehall by
listing members of the Cabinet committees at an unprecedented press
conference with Sir Robin Butler, Cabinet secretary.
Sir Robin will set out at an 'on the record' press conference the
composition of 26 committees and publish 'Questions of Procedure for
Ministers' - the official document setting out responsibilities and
requirements of ministers.
He will be joined by Mr William Waldegrave, the Cabinet minister responsible
for the government's Citizen's Charter.
However, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office were last night unclear about
whether the setting up of future ad hoc committees, set up to resolve
particular issues, would be announced immediately - or wait for an annual
review.
If the existence of ad hoc committees is admitted only periodically, much of
the impact of the greater openness would be lost. Controversial issues could
be deferred to a undisclosed committee.
In the Commons, Mr Waldegrave admitted yesterday that there was room for
'very great improvement' in government's attitude to secrecy. In the past,
secrecy had been used for 'reasons which this House does not want to see in
the future,' he said.
The present government's presumption would be that information should be
released unless there were 'pressing' public interest reasons for it not to
be, Mr Waldegrave said.
