FT  05 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Trade in Russian debt up
sharply in wake of agreement

AN UNEXPECTED resched-uling agreement reached by Russia and western creditor
banks has triggered a sharp increase in price and trading volume on the
secondary market for Russian debt, debt traders said yesterday.
The price has risen from 28 cents to the dollar before the London Club
agreement was announced in a circular by the banks' advisory committee last
Friday to 33 cents on Monday and 41 to 42 cents yesterday.
Mr Peter Bartlett, a trader in east European debt at Morgan Grenfell in
London, said his bank, which makes a market in the debt, had on Tuesday
alone conducted 30 transactions averaging Dollars 2m to Dollars 3m each.
He said the main buying had come from North and Latin American investors who
had made big profits on Latin American debts and who were looking for
another 'very exciting rollercoaster LDC ride'.
Bankers said the market had not expected an agreement so soon given the
impression that of chaos prevails within Russia and that Russia might try to
drag out the rescheduling talks.
Under the provisional deal reached by Mr Andrei Vavilov, the deputy finance
minister, in Frankfurt last week, Russia has agreed to pay Dollars 500m in
three tranches in the last quarter of 1993. Repayment of another Dollars 3bn
of interest owed this year will be postponed for five years. Russia's latest
estimate of its commercial bank debt is Dollars 24bn.
Repayment details have yet to be agreed with creditors, however, and there
is no guarantee the government will deliver when the time comes.
Possible explanations for Russia's rush to conclude an agreement range from
national pride to a desire by the reformist finance ministry to assert
Russia's credibility when domestic political chaos has been aggravated by
the central bank's botched monetary reform.
