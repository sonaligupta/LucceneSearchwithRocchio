FT  27 MAR 92 / Observer: Fresh prospect


Having already found and sold a gold mine, Chile's Julia Aspillaga is
opening up a new line of career. With today's launch of a Santiago office by
Yorkton Securities - the first Canadian brokerage house to set up in Chile -
she is to act as its investment adviser there.
The well connected mining entrepreneur first broke into the industry by
joining Anglo American's subsidiary in Chile on the administration side in
the 1980s. She then branched off on her own and has been involved in
numerous mining projects, including the San Cristobal gold mine, eventually
sold to Battle Mountain Gold's subsidiary, Niugini Mining.
While going on running her Windsor Resources exploration company, which is
looking for more gold and copper projects, at Yorkton's office she will work
with another woman with mining even deeper in her veins: operations manager
Catherine McLeod.
Daughter of Canadian mines man Don McLeod, she has worked mainly as a banker
and broker to the mining community. She says that, by having people on the
spot, Yorkton should be well set to win business from the expected second
wave of mines investment in Chile - now the mining houses' favourite
stamping ground.
