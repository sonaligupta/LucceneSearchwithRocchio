FT  23 OCT 92 / People: IT at Asda


Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain which is busily trying to revive its
flagging fortunes, has recruited an IT specialist from Midland Bank to work
on its systems development.
In recent years, Asda has lagged behind rivals such as Tesco, Sainsbury and
Safeway in making the most effective use of the information garnered from
electronic point of sale equipment at check-outs.
But Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive, now places great emphasis on
improving the company's performance in this area and has recruited Philip
Langsdale to implement the necessary changes.
Langsdale, 36, is currently Midland's director of IT planning and has been
immersed in bits and bytes most of his working life at IBM, Nolan Norton and
Coopers & Lybrand.

Patrick Brennan, who looks after the Financial Times's circulation in the
Americas, has won a top newspaper industry award. The American Association
of Independent Newspaper Distributors has named him as the 1992 circulation

Brennan is the first recipient of the award which will be presented at a
luncheon in Santa Monica today. The AAIND, which has 700 members in 33
states, says that the award will be given annually to the circulation
executive who represents the best example of publishing management and
independent distributors working together to increase circulation.

copies a day.
