FT  12 MAR 92 / Ferry operators rebuffed on merger


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


CROSS-CHANNEL car ferry operators were yesterday rebuffed by the government
in their request to be allowed to merge their Dover-Calais services to fight
competition from the Channel tunnel, Richard Tomkins writes.
The Department of Trade and Industry, accepting a recommendation from the
Office of Fair Trading, said it would not release the ferry operators from
earlier undertakings preventing them from merging their cross-Channel
operations.
The approach to the Department of Trade and Industry was made in January by
P&O, the market leader on the route. P&O and Sealink Stena Line, its biggest
rival, have long argued that their only chance of competing with the tunnel
is to join forces and offer a single high-frequency service between Dover
and Calais.
P&O wants to remove Sealink from the Dover-Calais route so that it can run
the service on its own.
DTI officials pointed out that P&O's submission had been followed by an
announcement from Eurotunnel that the tunnel's full operation would be
delayed until mid 1994, a year later than planned.
The Department of Transport has approved a British Rail order for 1,000
wagons costing Pounds 65m for Channel-tunnel freight services.
