FT  11 JAN 92 / Letter: Average returns and cash flows of pension funds


   From Mr ANDREW BRIDGFORD


As a pension fund investment consultant, I would like to take issue with
three points in your article, 'Strong showing for UK pension funds' (January
2), one of which is fairly minor but the other two of which might mislead
the reader.
First, and perhaps I am being a trifle pedantic here, we do not yet know the
average return for 1991 as no returns have yet been calculated for the final
quarter: we can only make an estimate based on actual results to September
30 1991 and index projections for the last three months of the year.
Second, re the statement 'returns on equities alone were a record 20 per
cent', the returns on equities were by no means the best since 1976: UK
equity returns were better in as many as seven of the past 15 years, in
1977, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986 and 1989.
Finally, although managers may claim to prefer strong cash flows - who
wouldn't with fees based on market values - smaller cash flows which
restrict fund managers' investment flexibility may be a blessing in
disguise.
For the past four years, those funds with negative cash flows have
outperformed those with positive flows, by about half a per cent a year.
