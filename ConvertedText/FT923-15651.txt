FT  01 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Abbey National raises MTN
programme


   By SIMON LONDON


ABBEY NATIONAL Treasury Services, the funding arm of the UK bank, has
doubled the size of its global medium-term note (MTN) programme to Dollars
10bn, making it one of the largest borrowing programmes outstanding.
Additional borrowing will be used to fund Abbey National's growing portfolio
of securities and non-mortgage assets, including leasing and backing for
structured finance transactions.
An MTN programme provides a legal framework under which a borrower can
quickly issue bonds where pockets of investor demand are identified. The
Abbey National programme allows it to issue bonds between one year and
30-year maturities, in a range of currencies, and in both the Euromarket and
US domestic market.
The programme was increased from Dollars 1.5bn to Dollars 5bn last year. Mr
Jonathan Nicholls, director of capital markets, said the latest increase
should cover Abbey National's funding requirements to the end of 1993.
Two new dealers, Yamaichi International and Credit Suisse First Boston, have
been added to the 10 already committed to the programme.
Abbey National's core mortgage lending business is growing only slowly,
reflecting the depressed state of the UK property market. Mortgage lending
is funded mainly from retail deposits.
However, Abbey National has surplus balance sheet capacity. Capital market
borrowings are used to fund holdings of non-mortgage assets, including a
portfolio of mortgage-backed bonds and leasing assets. The bank currently
holds Pounds 10bn to Pounds 12bn of such 'investment' assets.
Last year, Abbey National Treasury Services showed a Pounds 62m profit by
exploiting the difference between its cost of funds - usually at levels
below the London inter-bank offered rate - and return on assets.
