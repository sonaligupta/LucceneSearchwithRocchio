FT  29 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ex-First Boston chief joins
Tiger


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


MR Archibald Cox, who resigned four months ago as chief executive of First
Boston, the Wall Street investment bank, is to join Tiger Management, the
New York investment group.
Mr Cox will become chairman of the Hong-Kong based Tiger International Fund,
which will invest Dollars 1bn directly into the developing economies of Asia
Pacific, Latin America and eastern Europe.
'The securities markets in many of these nations are not large enough to
accommodate the growing institutional investor interest in the area, and in
some cases are not completely open to foreign investors. We believe that
attractive opportunities exist for direct investment in many of these
countries,' Mr Cox said.
Mr John Griffin, president of Tiger Management, described Mr Cox as one of
Wall Street's most respected investment bankers, and said that his 15 years
of experience doing business in Asia 'should mesh perfectly with Tiger's
expanding role and expertise in the region'.
Mr Cox made his reputation as an investment banker in Asia Pacific and
London, where he helped Morgan Stanley establish a presence in Euromarkets.
He joined CS First Boston in the late 1980s and rose to the top of the New
York operation.
Mr Cox was unseated this year after clashing with senior managers at CSFB
over compensation levels for First Boston's top investment bankers.
Tiger Management, founded in 1980 by Mr Julian Robertson, fund manager,
manages about Dollars 6.5bn in funds, which it invests around the world.
