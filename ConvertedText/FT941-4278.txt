FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Pranda buys UK distribution
company

   BANGKOK


Pranda, south-east Asia's largest jewellery exporter of low- to
medium-priced gemstones, is paying Bt26m (Dollars 689,000) for its
distribution company in Britain, Pranda UK, writes William Barnes in
Bangkok.
Pranda has moved strongly into the North American and European markets since
its formation in 1984. Increasing its distribution network hurt
unconsolidated profits last year, down from Bt226m to Bt152.5m on sales of
Bt1,193m.
