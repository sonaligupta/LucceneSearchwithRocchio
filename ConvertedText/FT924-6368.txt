FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Improvement in North America
props Electrolux

ELECTROLUX, the Swedish white goods manufacturer, said profits after
financial items fell to SKr736m (Dollars 112.7m) in the first nine months
from SKr890m in the same period a year ago.
The result would have been 4 per cent higher if the 1991 figure had not been
inflated by SKr184m in capital gains.
Rationalisation and an upswing in North America has helped the group offset
the impact of weak demand in key European markets.
Sales for the nine months fell to SKr58.9bn from SKr59.8bn. Operating income
after depreciation dropped to SKr1.89bn from SKr2.12bn, which the group
blamed on the weaker performance of its commercial appliance and industrial
product operations.
In the third quarter, the group recorded a SKr22m loss, SKr5m less than in
the same 1991 three months.
The period saw intensified competition and reduced sales in Europe,
particularly in the Nordic countries. In Germany demand for white goods
remained strong, but it declined in other product areas.
On prospects, the group commented: 'High interest rates, restrained
investment and consumption, and general uncertainty about the future will
involve a continued weakening of the market situation in Europe.
'However,a continued but slow improvement in business conditions is expected
in North America.'
The group noted that changes in European currency rates would improve its
long-term competitive position.
