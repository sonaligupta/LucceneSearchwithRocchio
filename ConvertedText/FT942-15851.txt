FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Scottish TV rises 21% to Pounds 13m


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Scottish Television hopes to avoid the takeover wars in ITV. It has no
intention of trying to acquire Grampian Television, its Scottish neighbour,
and will in turn resist being taken over itself.
The declaration of independence came yesterday from Mr Bill Brown, its
chairman, and Mr Gus Macdonald, managing director, as they announced a 21
per cent increase to Pounds 13m in pre-tax profits in the year to
end-December 1993.
There has long been speculation that Scottish might move against
Aberdeen-based Grampian, but Mr Macdonald said yesterday it made no sense
'to risk a civil war in Scotland' simply to add Grampian's 1 per cent of ITV
advertising revenue to Scottish Television's 5 per cent.
The two executives suggested, however, that they might be interested in
talking to a potential minority investor who could open doors
internationally for Scottish or give the company a stake in cable or
satellite television.
'We would look very closely at a proposition of that kind, but we are not
out looking for that kind of liaison,' said Mr Brown, who added that the
company's main ambition was to increase its programme making.
The increase in profits, which Mr Brown called 'a sparkling performance',
came from turnover on continuing operations marginally down on 1992 - Pounds
125m compared with Pounds 126m.
Earnings per share rose by 29 per cent to 21.29p (16.54p) and the proposed
final dividend is 10.2539p, making 12.4102p (9.9281p) for the year.
Profits were boosted by continued cost cutting and savings from previous
redundancies - staff numbers have fallen from 800 to 350 in the past five
years - and increased sales of programmes to the ITV network. Scottish has
just won another 13 episodes of the relaunch of the drama series, Dr Finlay.
In its first year as a separate subsidiary the company's network programme
arm, Scottish Television Enterprises, increased sales by 60 per cent from
Pounds 22.1m to Pounds 35.2m.
The shares fell 22p to 482p, mainly because a number of analysts were
forecasting higher profit figures. Some may not have taken into account the
Pounds 6m spent on 300 hours of local programmes.
The company's outplacement agency, Pauline Hyde & Associates, managed only
Pounds 104,000 profit on turnover of Pounds 12.1m and in the medium term the
company will be sold or floated.
Scottish believes that GMTV, the breakfast station in which it has a 20 per
cent stake, is now heading for breakeven this year.
