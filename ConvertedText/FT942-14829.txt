FT  19 APR 94 / Liverpool post strike ends


A six-day strike by postal workers in Liverpool ended yesterday after a
postman was allowed to return to work and assurances were given that he
would receive a fair hearing.
The unofficial strike began on Wednesday when the postman was suspended from
work at the city's main sorting office. The suspension followed a row with a
supervisor over an unofficial tea break.
