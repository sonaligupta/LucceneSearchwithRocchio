FT  19 MAY 92 / Observer: No answer


The director of The Spectator magazine was running a few minutes late when
he arrived for Thursday's board meeting at the St James's headquarters of
chairman Algy Cluff. But he was sure he would soon catch up.
The problem was the door was shut. And there was no sign of a bell that
worked. Neither knocking on the door nor even shouting through the letterbox
raised a response. As a last resort he turned to his car phone. That ought
to get someone to the door.
There was no answer.
In the end Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, owner of The
Spectator, gave it all up as a bad job and went off to dinner. The
experience will do little to temper Black's long-held view that journalists,
however talented, tend towards the tiresome and eccentric.
Wasn't my fault, bleated Spectator editor Dominic Lawson yesterday. He was
out of town at a much more important event. Addressing the Oxford Union.
