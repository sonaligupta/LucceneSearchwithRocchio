FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GWR seeks easing of growth limit as profits
rise


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


GWR, the Bristol-based commercial radio group, yesterday renewed its appeal
to the government to relax the restrictions on station ownership.
Mr Ralph Barnard, chief executive, attacked what he called 'the ludicrous
anomaly' preventing GWR from expanding because it had the maximum 20
licences even though together they reach only 8m people. Other radio
companies, with fewer but larger licences, could reach 16m to 17m people.
'We are being forced abroad by this. We would much rather spend our energies
and our money in the UK,' said Mr Barnard, who expressed surprise at how
long it was taking the government to deal with what appeared to be a simple
issue.
He was speaking after the group announced trebled pre-tax profits of Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 900,000) for the year to September 30 on turnover more than
doubled at Pounds 21.7m.
Earnings per share came out at 38.4p (18.4p) and a proposed final dividend
of 7.5p makes a total of 13p (9p).
During the year acquisitions increased GWR's potential audience from 3m to
8m with the addition of stations such as Radio Trent in Nottingham and Derby
and the Mid Anglia group with stations in Peterborough, Cambridge and Kings
Lynn.
The acquisitions accounted for Pounds 1.1m of total operating profit of
Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1m). The results did not include any contribution from
GWR's 17 per cent stake in Classic FM which is not yet paying a dividend.
Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, said that the present year had begun well 'with
revenues ahead of budget and strongly ahead of last year'.
James Capel, GWR's broker, yesterday raised its forecast for the current
year from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 4.5m.
