FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Portuguese bank turns in 13%
fall at halfway

Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second largest bank, has reported a
13.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Es9.26bn (Dollars 58m) for the
first half of 1994.
BPA said the slide was due mainly to a 31.7 per cent increase in provisions
against credit and other risks to Es11.74bn as a result of recession in
1993.
Earnings were also affected by investments in overseas subsidiaries and in
Uniao de Bancos Portugueses, a small retail bank in which BPA acquired a
controlling stake in 1993, BPA said.
Cash flow in the first half rose 10.6 per cent, compared with the same
period last year, to Es24.37bn. Total deposits increased 7 per cent to
Es1,364.76bn. The group's loan portfolio grew 1.6 per cent to Es811.46bn.
Net assets rose 16.4 per cent to Es2,538bn.
BPA has set aside Es326m for tax payments on first-half earnings. No tax
provisions were made during the first half of 1993.
The state is due to sell its remaining 24.39 per cent holding in BPA but no
date has been set. A group of Portuguese businessmen has acquired a
controlling stake of about 27 per cent since privatisation of the bank began
in stages in 1990.
BPA increased its capital from Es100bn to Es110bn in a rights issue that
closed on July 1.
