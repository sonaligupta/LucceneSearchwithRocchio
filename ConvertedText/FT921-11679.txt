FT  30 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Affiliation policy stands, says MoD


   By LISA WOOD


THE MINISTRY of Defence yesterday denied it had climbed down over plans to
derecognise unions affiliated to the Labour party which represent security
guards.
The TGWU and GMB general unions said Mr Kenneth Carlisle, under-secretary of
state at the MoD, told them yesterday that he was prepared to consider the
principle of whether security guards, who are being moved from blue-collar
to white-collar status, could belong to unions affiliated to Labour.
The MoD told the unions last week that it was the government's view that
political affiliation by a union was counter to the need for the political
neutrality of non-industrial grades in the Civil Service.
It also said that the TGWU and GMB could no longer be involved in the talks
on pay and conditions for the 2,400 security guards who are to be
reorganised and who will join non-industrial grades of the civil service in
April. The MoD and the unions agreed that the ministry had climbed down over
the immediate issue of negotiating new terms and conditions.
Mr Danny Bryan, a TGWU national officer, said: 'The minister said he was
prepared to consider the principle of whether non-industrial grades in the
civil servants could belong to a trade union affiliated to a political
party.'
The MoD said it was happy to consider a paper from the unions, but added:
'Our policy still stands on political affiliation.' It said Mr Carlisle
would consider representations, but was just one junior minister in one
department and could not overrule government policy.
