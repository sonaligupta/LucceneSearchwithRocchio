FT  12 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Laughing all the way . . .


Henry is 40 and works for a merchant bank in the City of London; it pays him
Pounds 70,000 a year. On April 6, he will hand back his present company car,
a one-year-old Rover Sterling with a list price of Pounds 27,795 and take
delivery of a new BMW 525i SE costing Pounds 25,850.
Four years ago he married Fiona, an art teacher now aged 33 and earning
Pounds 15,000; she also has freelance income of about Pounds 1,000 a year.
They have no children.
Henry has stock exchange investments worth Pounds 90,000, in which he deals
fairly actively. Fiona's parents gave her Pounds 100,000 when she married
(although nothing since), which was invested in a house which she owns
jointly with Henry.
He is feeling pleased with his financial acumen as he has:
Transferred investments to Fiona, which she sold in 1993/94 and realised
gains of Pounds 3,000 tax-free. (He has used his own CGT allowance already.)
Persuaded Fiona's parents that they should use their IHT exemptions and each
give her Pounds 6,000 before April 6.
Persuaded the managing director to order him to drive to Scotland to see a
client late this month: this will bring his business mileage to more than
2,500.
Henry calculates he has saved the couple Pounds 1,200 in CGT by giving the
investments to Fiona. By driving more than 2,500 business
miles in 1993-94, he has reduced the tax on his car by Pounds 1,242 (40 per
cent of Pounds 9,315 minus Pounds 6,210).
He expects he will drive more than 2,500 miles on business in his BMW next
year, too. The new benefit value for 1994-95 will be Pounds 6,032, rather
than the Pounds 6,210 scale charge for the Rover in 1993-94.
With almost Pounds 2,442 in hand for the present year and more in the bush
for next, Henry is in the mood to celebrate. He plans to take Fiona for a
weekend in Gleneagles while they decide how to spend it.
