FT  12 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant hits out at Aberdeen's hostile bid


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


BRABANT Resources, the oil and gas explorer, yesterday attacked the hostile
takeover bid from fellow USM oil group Aberdeen Petroleum as a desperate
attempt to revive declining production.
'Aberdeen brings nothing to the table except a ravenous hunger for Brabant's
production and cash flow,' the group said in its defence document published
yesterday.
Aberdeen's production had fallen by 11 per cent in 1992, the document
stated, while Brabant's had been 52 per cent higher.
High overheads had also squeezed profits at Aberdeen, which has most of its
assets in North America and a head office in the UK. Brabant said Aberdeen's
overheads averaged at 27 per cent of sales for the last three years, while
its own costs were running at less than 10 per cent.
Brabant also accused Aberdeen of wasting Pounds 400,000 in shareholders
funds to launch the hostile bid.
Aberdeen, for its part, rejected Brabant's comparison of overheads. The
predator claimed that Brabant had capitalised a substantial proportion of
overhead in recent years.
'If Brabant had adopted Aberdeen's own prudent accounting policies,' Mr
David Hooker, managing director said, 'it would have reported a loss of over
Pounds 800,000 for the year, as opposed to a Pounds 366,000 pre-tax profit.'
