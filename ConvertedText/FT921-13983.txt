FT  18 JAN 92 / Pretoria to seek cash boost for 1991 budget

THE South African Government, under political pressure to raise social
spending despite deep recession, is to ask parliament next month to approve
a substantial additional budget for the current fiscal year.
Mr Barend du Plessis, the Finance Minister, said the government's deficit
before borrowing would be higher than expected. This deficit was originally
budgeted at 3.4 per cent of gross domestic product - the IMF recommends no
more than 3 per cent of GDP - but economists now believe it could total as
much as 5 per cent of GDP.
He said state expenditure was running ahead of budget, rising by 18.5 per
cent for the first nine months of fiscal 1991/92 compared with the year
earlier period. It would be necessary to ask parliament for a substantial
additional budget to meet extra spending needs, especially on health,
finance for black townships, and interest on public debt. He gave no figure
for the amount sought, but said it would be substantially larger than the
R1.2bn contingency reserve envisaged in the budget.
Meanwhile revenues remain depressed by the severe recession, with exchequer
receipts rising only 7.6 per cent in the first nine months, against 11 per
cent budgeted for the year.
