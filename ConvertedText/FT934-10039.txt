FT  08 NOV 93 / London bus plan review expected


   By DAVID OWEN


MINISTERS are expected to drop plans to de-regulate bus services in London
from a wide-ranging de-regulation bill which is set for the next
parliamentary session starting in two weeks.
The bill is intended to be one of the two legislative corner-stones of the
new session. A final decision on whether to omit the London bus proposals
may be made as soon as today.
This follows a finely balanced argument in the cabinet between de-regulation
enthusiasts and others - understood to include Mr John Major, the prime
minister - who fear that proceeding with the plan might harm Conservative
prospects in next year's London borough elections.
Backbench discontent over the proposals erupted publicly during the summer,
with Sir Rhodes Boyson, the MP for Brent North and a former Tory minister,
warning that de-regulation was 'a form of suicide pill' for the party's
chances in the elections next May.
A poor Conservative performance then and in the European elections a month
later would trigger renewed doubts about Mr Major's leadership.
The plans to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital,
which were de-regulated in the mid-1980s, have been criticised by local
authorities and London Transport on the grounds that they would lead to road
congestion and fare rises.
Tory business managers have tried to focus the new session's legislative
timetable on issues such as law and order which are calculated to unite the
party.
This follows the debilitating wrangling that accompanied the tortuous
passage of the Maastricht bill through parliament.
