DOMTAR, the big Canadian forest products and building materials group,
reported improved second-quarter operating results. But after restructuring
charges, net losses emerged at CDollars 39m (USDollars 32.5m), against
losses of CDollars 37m a year earlier. Sales rose 3 per cent to CDollars
484m.
Business paper sales rose 5 per cent and market pulp, newsprint and
groundwood specialities 4 per cent, and building materials 6 per cent, but
packaging products declined.
