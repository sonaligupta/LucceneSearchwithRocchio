FT  20 APR 94 / Watanabe drops bid to be PM


   By WILLIAM DAWKINS


Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party averted a break-up yesterday
when Mr Michio Watanabe, a veteran faction leader, formally dropped his bid
to be prime minister.
Mr Watanabe cited policy differences with the ruling coalition as the reason
for his decision to drop plans to defect and run for the leadership.
The LDP will now follow normal party practice and propose its president, Mr
Yohei Kono, as prime ministerial candidate. He is nearly certain to lose
against Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, in a parliamentary vote in
the next few days.
Senior coalition officials yesterday continued to inch towards agreement on
a joint policy platform, required before the formation of a new government.
By yesterday evening, they had settled almost all the points on a 10-point
policy plan, with the exception of a proposal backed by the Japan Renewal
party, which dominates coalition policy, to increase indirect taxes.
The Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest partner, wants to avoid
a firm commitment on raising sales tax, for fear of alienating its
diminishing electoral support.
Little argument is expected, by contrast, over the line-up of the new
cabinet. Mr Hata said yesterday he wants few changes in the present cabinet,
to allow incumbent ministers to defend this year's budget as it passes
through parliament. Only two jobs are likely to be vacant, those of foreign
minister and of chief cabinet secretary - the government's spokesman.
Parliamentary officials said they were working on the assumption that there
would be a coalition accord on tax in time for a parliamentary vote on the
leadership this week.
