FT  16 JAN 92 / Observer: Cheque up


Someone, at least, feels sorry for UK chancellor Norman Lamont. The Treasury
has reported a dramatic upturn in what it rather quaintly terms 'voluntary
donations' to the exchequer's coffers.
Good citizens, perhaps worried about the impact of the recession on the
nation's finances, sent unsolicited contributions totalling Pounds 147,012
and 95 pence to the Treasury in the 12 months to October. That compared with
a meagre Pounds 2,587 and 50 pence in the previous year.
Some unkind onlookers at Westminster were last night pointing out that the
surge in generosity coincided almost to the month with Margaret Thatcher's
departure. But they had perhaps forgotten that in her first year of office
such donations reached a record of over Pounds 310,000.
So perhaps now it is Lamont's baleful countenance which is pulling in the
cheques. He would not mind a few more to pay for those pre-election tax
cuts.
