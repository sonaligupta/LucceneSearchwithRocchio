FT  21 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Rate war fears hit banks


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO


High street bank shares fell sharply in late trade as disappointment over
the latest bank lending figures was compounded by reports of a customer
lending rate cut by Midland Bank which prompted fears of a price war in the
sector.
Bank and building society lending grew by Pounds 2.9bn in May, against
forecasts of a Pounds 1.3bn increase, but the bias was towards credit card
and mortgage loans, and corporate lending was weak. Then Midland, the high
street arm of HSBC, cut its personal lending rate by 2 percentage points.
Prices in the sector were immediately chopped back as speculation ran
through the City that Credit Lyonnais Laing was poised to respond with a
significant downgrading of banks.
But Laing was phlegmatic, saying it had recommended an underweight stance
since the start of the year and was unlikely to change its views ahead of
Lloyds Bank's interim results on July 29. HSBC, buoyed by a firm Hong Kong
market, lost only 3 at 735p, but Barclays slid 8 to 546p, Lloyds 14 to 556p
and National Westminster 16 to 458p.
