FT  27 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wiggins losses at Pounds 9.21m


SHARP INCREASES in losses were reported by Wiggins Group, the commercial and
residential property developer which survived the collapse of its Docklands
development at the cost of virtually all its working capital, for the year
to March 31 1992.
At the pre-tax level losses escalated from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds 9.21m. The
figure was struck after exceptional losses of Pounds 6.07m (Pounds 914,000)
including Pounds 6m from the south western housebuilding subsidiary.
Negotiations may shortly be concluded for the disposal of the south western
company which will have the effect of cutting the net asset deficiency by
Pounds 3m to Pounds 7m.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 7.98m (Pounds 11.5m). Losses per share amounted
to 77.9p, compared with 15.7p.
The group continued to trade even at its current level, only with the
support of its banks and creditors.
