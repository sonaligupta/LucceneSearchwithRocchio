FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: NTT joins General Magic

NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, said yesterday it was investing
in General Magic, the US company which is developing technology for
multi-media products.
NTT's decision to join a string of international investors in General Magic
increases the possibility that the US company's technology will become the
de facto industry standard for portable multi-media communications. This
area is expected to become one of the most promising growth industries.
Multi-media is the combination of text, sound and pictures with computing
and telecommunications functions.
Apple Computer, the US computer company, AT&T and Motorola, US
telecommunications companies, Matsushita of Japan and Philips of the
Netherlands, invest in General Magic. The companies have formed the General
Magic Alliance and are developing products and services based on General
Magic's communications software.
NTT's involvement in the General Magic Alliance promises to kick-start the
market for hand-held multi-media devices as the larger number of products on
the market is likely to stimulate demand for them.
NTT, which is joining a foreign software alliance for the first time, would
develop multi-media services based on technology licensed from General
Magic, it said.
The Japanese telecommunications group hopes its tie-up with General Magic
will enable it to use its technologies in standardising global
communications services.
