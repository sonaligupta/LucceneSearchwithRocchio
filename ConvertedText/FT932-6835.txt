FT  26 MAY 93 / Norway boycotted over whaling

TWO supermarket groups, including Germany's Tengelmann - said to be Europe's
biggest food chain - have announced a boycott of Norwegian food and fish
products in protest against the Oslo government's decision to resume
commercial whaling.
Norway decided last week that it would allow the killing of 296 minke whales
in defiance of an eight-year ban on whaling by the International Whaling
Commission. Of the total, 160 whales were allotted as commercial catch; the
balance for scientific research.
Tengelmann, which has 4,500 food stores, imports Norwegian food and fish
products worth an estimated NKr100m (Dollars 14.3m) annually.
Total German imports of Norwegian products, excluding petroleum, reached
NKr15.9bn in 1992. Of the total, NKr1.4bn represents food products of which
NKr1.26bn is fish, mainly salmon. An executive with the Dusseldorf arm of
the Norwegian Trade Council said Tengelmann stressed it would stick to its
boycott decision until Norway conformed to the IWC ban.
Tengelmann banned imports of food products from Iceland in 1988 when it
resumed commercial whaling and has long been known for its green policies.
The trade council said that Nordsaade, a member of the Unilever group, had
also decided to stop buying Norwegian products from all companies and
suppliers which had either direct or indirect connections to Norwegian
whalers.
The Norwegian government reiterated the argument yesterday that its decision
to resume whaling is based on scientific research and responsible management
of marine resources.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Norwegian fisheries directorate, which is
responsible for assigning individual whale quotas, said yesterday that 32
boats had qualified for commercial whaling permits, although he added that
not all of the whalers had decided to resume the commercial hunt this year.
They have until June 4 to respond.
