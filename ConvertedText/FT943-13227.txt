FT  20 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris steer the
continent forward


Strength returned throughout the Continent yesterday.
PARIS finished at its highest level since the end of May, with the CAC-40
index up 27.20 or 1.3 per cent at 2,052.33, just off the day's best of
2,059.
Dealers attributed strength to the firmer bond markets and some
short-covering. Turnover was a firm FFr4.8bn.
Nomura Research has added its voice to expectations of an autumn rally in
the market - although given yesterday's performance the timing might well
come forward.
Casino once again featured with a 6 per cent gain, the share price rising
FFr8.90 to FFr161.90, although brokers could find no feature to explain the
movement.
FRANKFURT was underpinned by better than expected M3 data, which also came
out a few days ahead of schedule. This is likely to add pressure on the
Bundesbank, which meets tomorrow for the last time before the summer recess,
to trim interest rates.
The Dax index closed the session 30.60 or 1.5 per cent firmer at 2,128.79,
and in the post-bourse gained a little more to 2,129.86.
Mr Patrick Shields of NatWest Securities in London said that with the good
M3 data, the prospect of lower inflation and expectations of a further
reduction in interest rates, the stage was now set for a positive market
performance during the autumn. This should be supported by the publication
of half-year results starting next month, he said, which were likely to
confirm that an earnings recovery in the corporate sector was on course.
The chemicals sector stood out yesterday, with Hoechst rising DM16.70 to
DM328.70, BASF DM9.30 to DM303.80 and Schering DM15 to DM956.
MILAN rebounded after Monday's slide as signs emerged that the coalition
government was digging itself out of its difficulties. The Comit index
advanced 15.14 or 2.2 per cent to 704.83, with the day's industrial
production and industrial sales figures offering further support.
News that Mr Silvio Berlusconi had agreed with his coalition partners to
scrap the widely unpopular judicial decree, which would have limited
magistrates' powers of arrest, and submit a modified draft law to
parliament, came after the market had closed.
Banks took the market higher, with BCI providing the lead after shareholders
gave the board the go-ahead to launch a L2,380bn capital increase on August
10. The shares climbed L258 or 5.9 per cent to L4,643 after the bank also
forecast improved results for the year.
Credito Italiano added L151 or 7.3 per cent at L2,222 on hopes that it would
follow the BCI lead with its own rights issue.
Among blue chip industrials, Fiat appreciated L110 to L6,670, Pirelli rose
L115 to L2,775 and Montedison added L43 at L1,474.
AMSTERDAM enjoyed a positive spirit as confidence returned to the market.
The AEX index finished 5.51 firmer at 399.12, a day's improvement of 1.4 per
cent.
The internationals led the way, Royal Dutch moving ahead Fl 3.80 to Fl
193.60 and Philips up Fl 2.60 to Fl 52.90. However, KLM remained steady at
Fl 52.30 as two brokers came out with contrasting opinions on the stock.
Paribas Capital Markets, in its latest European aviation review, said that
it had upgraded its profits expectations, with the main reasons being that
the yield situation was no longer deteriorating.
Merrill Lynch, however, lowered its opinion, downgrading its intermediate
rating from above average to neutral. This was based, said Merrill Lynch, on
the stock's strong recent performance: since June 24 it has gained 15.5 per
cent. On a long term view - two years - it raised its rating from above
average to buy.
ZURICH turned higher in thin trade in response to lower interest rates and
the firmer dollar, and the SMI index regained the 2,500 level, rising 26.9
or 1.1 per cent to 2,521.6.
Roche certificates, which have led the market's declines over the last week,
picked up SFr35 to SFr5,295.
Sandoz registered shares moved forward SFr3 to SFr650: James Capel, which
rates the stock a sell, has downgraded its earnings forecasts, primarily to
reflect currency movements but also reduced expectations for the
pharmaceuticals division.
The interest rate outlook helped insurers to put in a firm showing. Swiss Re
gained SFr4 at SFr559 and Winterthur picked up another SFr17 to SFr675 in
further response to Monday's positive earnings forecast.
Nestle was SFr7 higher at SFr1,103 ahead of its first-half sales figures,
which came after the market had closed. In the event, the company reported
flat six monthly sales compared with analysts' forecasts of a 1 to 2 per
cent reduction.
