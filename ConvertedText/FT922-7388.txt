FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi in move to gain attraction in the
US


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


SAATCHI AND SAATCHI, the advertising group, has announced details of plans
to consolidate existing ordinary shares in order to make the company a more
attractive stock in the US.
Under the proposal, which will be put to shareholders at an extraordinary
general meeting, following the annual meeting on June 10, every 10 ordinary
shares of 10p will be consolidated into one new ordinary share of 25p.
At the same time every 10 American depositary receipts, each representing
three 10p ordinary shares, will be exchanged for one new ADR representing
three ordinary shares worth 25p each.
The company gives as its reasons for the move the need to increase its
attractiveness to US investors and to improve company administration.
Saatchi group currently has more than 1.5bn shares in issue.
Saatchi has also issued its 1991 annual report, which reveals that five
directors - Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, Mr Maurice Saatchi, Mr Charles Saatchi,
Mr Charles Scott and Mr Jeremy Sinclair - have agreed to waive Pounds 1m of
salary entitlements for the current year ending in December.
The Saatchi brothers are each waiving Pounds 312,500, the same as in 1991.
The report also shows six institutional holders of three per cent or more of
the ordinary share capital of the company, led by the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, with 7.97 per cent.
