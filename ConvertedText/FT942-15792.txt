FT  13 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Spain and Portugal on fast
track


   By DAVID GARDNER


European Union fisheries ministers last night overrode Irish objections to
bringing Spain and Portugal fully into the Common Fisheries Policy by
January 1996, six years ahead of the date agreed in 1986 when the Iberian
countries became member states.
Bringing forward the date was the political price Spain extracted last month
for accepting EU entry terms for Norway. The 12 agreed then that Norway's
powerful fishing industry would be integrated into the CFP in 1996 -
assuming it joins the Union next year - and that the fisheries restrictions
on two existing member states could therefore no longer be justified.
Full entry into the CFP will give the large Iberian fleets access to waters
west of the UK and Ireland. Currently, Spain is allowed 150 vessels at any
one time, from a list of 300, in UK waters, but both Spain and Portugal are
kept out of the so-called Irish Box under a regime which runs until the end
of next year.
Last night's framework agreement requires that there be no increase in
fishing effort, which would further deplete shrinking fisheries stocks, as a
result of the increased access. 'The Spanish will not get more fish out of
this text,' one British official insisted.
Eleven member states were willing to leave details of the adjusted CFP to be
ironed out later, probably through a regime making all member states subject
to a licensing system setting vessels' days at sea in western waters.
But Ireland held up agreement by insisting on immediate commitments that a
strict licensing and control regime would replace the current Irish Box
arrangements.
The 11-1 deal agreed that all fisheries management will take full account of
the stocks and 'biological vulnerability' of each fishing area, holding out
to the Irish the possibility of a conservation zone like the UK's Shetland
Box.
