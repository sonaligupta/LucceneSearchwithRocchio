FT  21 APR 94 / Bart's casualty closure 'unfair'


Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, acted 'unfairly, unlawfully and
unreasonably' in ordering the closure of the accident and emergency unit at
St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, the High Court heard yesterday.
Lord Lester QC said the consultation procedure was flawed because Mrs
Bottomley had in effect made up her mind by the time statutory consultations
started. He was appearing for the London boroughs of Islington and Hackney
and on behalf of an individual.
Lord Lester asked the court to grant a declaration that the decision last
year to authorise the closure by the end of this year was unlawful, and to
make an order quashing it.
But Mr David Pannick QC, for the health secretary, said the allegation of
bad faith was false.
