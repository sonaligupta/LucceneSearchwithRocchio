FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: CentreGold up 24% at Pounds 2.6m


   By PAUL TAYLOR


New product launches, higher US sales and the growing popularity of personal
computer software in CD-Rom format helped CentreGold, the computer games
publisher and distributor, offset margin pressures and turn in a 24 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits.
The group, which was floated in October, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.6m in the six months to January 31, up from Pounds 2.09m, on turnover
ahead by 43 per cent to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 36.6m.)
Earnings per share increased to 4.7p (4.46p) and the initial interim
dividend is set at 0.8p. The shares, which were placed at 125p, slipped by
2p to close at 134p.
Mr Geoff Brown, chief executive, said the results were 'fairly pleasing'.
The company had countered margin pressures by achieving substantial
increases in turnover and market share.
Turnover from the software publishing business increased by 81 per cent to
Pounds 26.2m. Cartridge software sales more than doubled to Pounds 19.2m
(Pounds 8.5m), reflecting the launch of the group's first Nintendo product
and the growth of the US publishing business.
US publishing sales jumped to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 2.7m) and overseas sales
now account for 34 per cent of turnover. In addition Mr Brown said sales of
higher margin PC-CD games had increased dramatically. These gains helped
offset lower margins on cartridge software sales in Europe, reflecting the
increased costs of producing higher specification cartridges which could not
be fully passed on to consumers. As a result operating profits from
publishing slipped to Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 1.45m).
In contrast, operating profits from software distribution grew to Pounds
1.18m (Pounds 646,000) on turnover increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 26.4m.
This reflected strong growth in sales to specialist retail chains and higher
export sales.
