FT  30 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Farepak confident of strong growth


Farepak, the USM-quoted mail order and food processing group, is confident
that the current year will show strong growth, and is raising its interim
dividend by 26 per cent.
The seasonal loss for the opening six months, to October 31 1991, was up
from Pounds 599,000 to Pounds 613,000. Turnover expanded to Pounds 10.4m
(Pounds 3.99m) as a result of the acquisition of Tranfood Meat which had
been integrated with the food processing business.
The interim dividend is 1.45p (1.15p). The previous year's total was 3.87p
from pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.7m.
