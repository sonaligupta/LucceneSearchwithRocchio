NOVA, the Alberta natural gas transporter and petro-chemical producer, is
emerging quickly from its 1989-91 over-expansion problems, writes Robert
Gibbens.
Second-quarter net profits were CDollars 41m (USDollars 34.10m) or 10 cents
a share, a turnround from losses of CDollars 6m or 4 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues fell to CDollars 750m from CDollars 778m.
First-half net profits rose to CDollars 73m or 18 cents a share, from
CDollars 32m or 8 cents, on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn, down from Dollars
1.6bn.
*****
Export Development Bank (BRE) of Poland has reported that the public sale of
47.5 per cent of its shares, which valued the group at Dollars 23m, and
ended last week, was oversubscribed, Christopher Bobinski writes from
Warsaw.
BRE said 2 per cent of its equity has been allocated to Girocredit Bank of
Austria. Other leading shareholders included two Polish private companies,
Realbud, a construction group, and Galtex, a food and textiles exporter and
retailer, with 5 per cent each.
*****
Elders Pastoral, New Zealand's second-biggest livestock group, has been sold
to its managers, by Fosters' Brewing, its former Australian owner, writes
Terry Hall from Wellington.
The price was not disclosed but assets of NZDollars 20m (USDollars 10.9m)
were transferred.
Mr Trevor Kamins, managing director, said the company had returned to
profitability after reducing losses over the past year.
*****
Petro-Canada, the country's second-biggest integrated oil company which was
partially privatised in 1991, earned net profits of CDollars 38m or 18 cents
a share in the first half, against losses of CDollars 149m or 49 cents a
year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.3bn, against CDollars 2.5bn, writes
Robert Gibbens.
The result benefited from accounting changes, but the company attributed the
turnround to reduced overheads.
