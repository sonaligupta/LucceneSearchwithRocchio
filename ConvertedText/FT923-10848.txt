FT  28 JUL 92 / Council house rents rise 11%


   By ANDREW ADONIS


COUNCIL HOUSE rents in England and Wales have risen by an average of 11 per
cent this year, taking the average increase since 1990 to 44 per cent,
according to a survey by local authority associations.
The survey of 282 councils shows average weekly rent levels up from Pounds
20.70 in 1989-90 to Pounds 29.81 this year, an increase of nearly a quarter
after inflation. Council rents are still lower than those in the private
rented sector in most areas.
The most significant force behind the steep increases is the government's
rule that local authorities must balance their housing revenue accounts
without subsidies from other sources. This is why some of the largest
increases are in Labour authorities: Camden in London has increased rents by
an average of 30 per cent this year and Hackney in London and Reading by 21
per cent.
Among Conservative councils, the largest increases this year are in Wycombe
(35 per cent), Bexley in London (34 per cent) and Hillingdon in London (28
per cent). Across England, the north-west has the lowest percentage rent
increase (7.4 per cent) and Greater London the highest (14.9 per cent). In
London the average weekly rent is more than Pounds 40.
Reduction in government subsidy is also a factor in the increases. This year
three-quarters of authorities will pay more in housing benefit than they
receive in housing revenue account subsidy, while expenditure on rent
rebates has risen from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds 3.4bn in the past year.
The survey, by the Association of District Councils and the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities, expects receipts from council house sales will
fall more than a third over the next year, from around Pounds 544m to Pounds
338m. It also expects local authority spending on repairs, improvement
grants and housing associations to decline sharply in cash terms.
