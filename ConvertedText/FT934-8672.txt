FT  13 NOV 93 / Tunisia ends Israeli ban


   By JULIAN OZANNE


   JERUSALEM


Israel yesterday received some of its first concrete political and economic
dividends from its peace accord with Palestinians as Zimbabwe said it was
establishing full diplomatic relations with the Jewish state and Tunisia
ended the ban on Israeli tourists, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
Both moves, part of a gradual easing of Israel's isolation by Arab and third
world countries, will help win popular support in Israel for the peace
process.
Under the Israeli-Tunisian tourism agreement Neot Hakikar, an Israeli
tourism company, will take its first two groups of Israeli tourists to
Tunisia next month after special approval was given by the Tunisian
president.
Israel's army said five members of Mr Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation had been involved in the recent killing of
a Jewish settler.
