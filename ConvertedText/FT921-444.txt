FT  28 MAR 92 / Accountants to give evidence on BCCI


   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent


TWO PARTNERS and a senior manager in Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm,
are to give evidence to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation about Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, which was closed by the Bank of England
last July.
Price Waterhouse, former auditor of BCCI, yesterday declined to identify the
three men, saying it was the firm's policy not to give out in-dividuals'
names for security reasons.
The three were involved in the Bank of England's investigation of BCCI.
The FBI wants their evidence as part of the US Department of Justice's
investigation into BCCI's involvement with three US banks - First American,
Independence Bank of Encino, California, and CenTrust Savings Bank in Miami,
Florida.
At Bow Street magistrates' court yesterday Mr Philip Sales, counsel for the
three witnesses, said they and PW were anxious to fulfil their public duties
and co-operate with the investigators, but they were bound by duties of
confidentiality.
They were therefore obliged, for their own protection, to give evidence
under compulsion, and accordingly witness orders had been made under the
1990 International Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act.
Earlier yesterday PW had cleared the way for the witnesses to co-operate
with the FBI by obtaining variations of High Court injunctions made against
BCCI restricting the provision of information to third parties.
The injunctions were granted last August to Mr Ghaith Pharaon, a Saudi
financier, Sheikh Kamal Adham, a former head of Saudi intelligence - both of
whom have been identified by the Federal Reserve as front men for BCCI in
its attempts to buy into the American banking industry - and Mr Elsayed
Eljawhary.
