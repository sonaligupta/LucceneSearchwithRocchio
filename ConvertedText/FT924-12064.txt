ASAHI Breweries, Japan's second-largest beer producer, will exercise a
majority of its entitlements to a two-for-five rights issue by Foster's
Brewing, the Australian group in which it holds a 20 per cent stake, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo.
Asahi Breweries will be entitled to one-fifth of the ADollars 1.02bn
(USDollars 729m) offering.
Mr Shigeto Oishi, director and general manager of Asahi Breweries'
international finance department, said it would exercise 'a majority' of its
rights but it had not yet decided the percentage.
