FT  05 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel firm


   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE


Turnover in British Steel rose to 9.5m as the shares put on 4 to 141 1/2 p,
after Thursday's positive meeting with a select group of analysts.
Engineering group Siebe closed 9 ahead at 616p, following a bullish
presentation at SG Warburg. TI Group improved 13 to 430p, in sympathy with
Siebe.
Motor dealer Henlys Group, cheered the market with a turnaround in full year
figures. The shares hardened 7 to 352p, after it reported profits of Pounds
7.3m, against last year's loss of 2.1m. The company also announced a
one-for-four rights issue at 280p, to raise Pounds 25.8m for expansion.
Among transport stocks, news of a writ for British Airways dampened
enthusiasm for the stock, leaving it to move against the market trend. The
shares gave up 5 1/2 to 434 1/2 p, after trade of 5.4m.
The spectre of big losses following the heavy losses and wild swings in
bonds and gilts over the past few weeks continued to cast a shadow over the
financial areas of the market.
In the high street banks Barclays, due to report preliminary figures next
Wednesday, suffered from intermittent bouts of selling pressure, the shares
eventually closing a net 6 off at 512p after good turnover of 5m. The bank
is expected to report pre-tax profits of upwards of Pounds 800m compared
with last year's Pounds 242m loss.
Standard Chartered, reporting on Tuesday, and heavily sold throughout the
week following HSBC's preliminary figures last Monday, fell a further 17 to
1112p with turnover reaching 1.2m shares. Analysts expect Standard to
achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 400m-plus.
HSBC, given a rough ride by the market despite its excellent figures, staged
a good recovery, the shares bouncing 20 to 856p. Lloyds managed a minor gain
at 578p while TSB were also chased up and settled 6 higher at 249p.
Hambros was the outstanding performer in the merchant banks, the stock price
racing up to 385p before closing a net 9 higher at 379p in the wake of the
optimism on the UK housing market expressed by associate Hambro Countrywide.
SG Warburg dropped to 820p early in the session before stabilising and
closing only marginally easier at 826p. Smith New Court, the securities
house and one of the London market's biggest marketmaking houses, rallied to
end the day a net 10 higher at 404p.
Union, the discount house, dropped 6 to 176p following news of the proposed
Pounds 11m rights issue.
Pearson was one of the best performers in the media sector closing 25 up at
693p, after news of Pounds 33m investment in a theme park in near Barcelona,
Spain. BZW also reiterated their buy stance on the shares saying that in a
fully-valued sector Pearson was one of the few with scope to surprise when
it reports on March 28, while a conference earlier in the week in Paris was
said to have offered good news on BSkyB.
Reuters continued to gain ground adding 44 more at 2078p, with analysts
divided over whether it was buying ahead of the four for one share split
scheduled for April 18 or a follow through from good figures and the recent
buy recommendation from Smith New Court.
But the general feeling was the sector is due for a period of quiet
consolidation and profit-taking. 'It's time to let some of the hot air out,'
said one.
Shares in Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing home, hospital and homecare
group, struggled on their market debut, opening around the 160p level and
making heavy weather before picking up to close at their issue price of
170p. Goldsborough was hived off from Kunick, the leisure group.
Calmer views on interest rate prospects kept the retailing and stores sector
quiet, although in line with the firmer trend across the market. Food
retailers were particularly strong, with Sainsbury up 12 to 379p and Kwik
Save up 8 to 612p as nervousness elsewhere turned buyers towards consumer
stocks. WH Smith rose 8 to 513p, with Morgan Stanley putting the stock back
on its buy list. Analyst Nicholas Bubb said that the company looked like
solving its two problems of Our Price and Do-It-All, with the former being
merged with Virgin Retail and a package being assembled to dispose of the
latter. He revised his 1994/5 forecasts up from Pounds 142m to Pounds 148m.
Kingfisher rose 8 to 604p and Marks & Spencer was up 7 to 426p.
Leisure stocks had a quiet day, with Rank Organisation rising 19 to 1100p
ahead of its share split on March 14. Turnover in Ladbroke, the casino and
hotels group, down  1/2 at 198 1/2 p, was slightly higher than average at
5.7m, as the market further absorbed Wednesday's results.
Good results and a positive post-results meeting with analysts saw Cookson
Group jump 13 to 266p. Volume rose to 5.6m.
