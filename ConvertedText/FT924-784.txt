FT  22 DEC 92 / NatWest pledges support for broking


   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor


NATIONAL Westminster Bank said yesterday that its stockbroking business had
emerged successfully from its two years probation and there was no longer
any question of closing or selling the business.
However, it also said that the broker's name would be changed from County
NatWest Securities to NatWest Securities from the beginning of the year.
The announcements were made by Dr Martin Owen, in his first interview as
chief executive of NatWest Markets, which groups together all the bank's
investment and corporate banking businesses.
Dr Owen has been conducting a review of all NatWest Markets operations since
he became chief executive in June. The outcome was particularly important
for County NatWest, because Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, said in
February 1991 that the securities business had two years to prove its worth.
'We have made a firm commitment to stay in equities', said Dr Owen. 'It is
part of our core business'.
His statement will come as a disappointment to many of his rivals, who had
been hoping that a NatWest withdrawal would reduce excess capacity in the
London securities market.
The renaming follows the adverse publicity County NatWest received from the
Blue Arrow affair, which led to two Department of Trade and Industry
inquiries and a criminal prosecution against the bank.
However, Dr Owen believes that the name still has some value, so its
corporate finance and investment management operations will continue to
trade as County NatWest.
Last week, NatWest gave up its seat on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which is
likely to lead to the loss of more than 70 jobs in Japan. But Dr Owen said
no other parts of the equities business, which employs just over 1,000
people worldwide, were earmarked for closure.
Dr Owen refused to comment on the business's 1992 performance, because the
bank has entered the closed season when it is prohibited from discussing its
latest financial results. However, he was confident that the equities
business would make a profit in 1993 - as would the whole of NatWest
Markets.
