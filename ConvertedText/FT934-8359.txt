FT  16 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Credito Italiano


After Spain's success with Argentaria and that of France with BNP, Italy
needs a good banking story to tell in its first privatisation. There must be
some doubt whether it has found one in Credito Italiano, which is saddled
with a low return on capital of only 4.5 per cent and an exposure to the
Ferruzzi group equal to nearly a quarter of its net equity.
Arguably Istituto Mobiliare Italiano would have been a better choice to
launch Italy's privatisation programme. Though smaller, its return on
capital is about twice as high as that of Credito. An IMI sale might have
been used to whet appetites for less attractive offerings which also include
Banca Commerciale. But Credito better fulfils the political requirement for
a large deal which spreads share ownership broadly among the Italian public,
without leaving large blocs in the hands of particular interest groups.
Some hefty promotional discounts may thus be in order for Credito's
employees and depositors. These might then be able to convince themselves
they are buying a recovery stock, on the same principle whereby Barclays has
outperformed Lloyds by over 40 per cent since its dividend cut in March. But
by then Barclays had confronted the worst.
Credito cannot yet discern the full dimensions of its Ferruzzi problem; nor
will it easily repeat this year's bond market gains. Besides, selling the
stock cheap to retail investors could backfire without a strong
after-market. That will not come naturally to a share which has lost a third
of its value this year.
