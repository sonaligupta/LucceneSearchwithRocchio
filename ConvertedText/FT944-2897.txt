Rhodia-Ster, a Brazilian joint venture controlled by the French chemicals
group Rhone-Poulenc, is set to raise between Dollars 135m and Dollars 159m
in a global initial public offering. It will be the first time in at least
15 years that a foreign company has floated part of a Brazilian subsidiary.
The company, which makes polyester-based products such as flexible packaging
and returnable bottles, is offering 117.7m voting shares - 23 per cent of
its capital - in three equal parts to the US, European and Brazilian
markets.
Mr Edson Vaz Musa, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc's Brazilian subsidiary Rhodia,
said the proceeds would largely be used to pay for Rhodia's capitalisation
of Rhodia-Ster, formed in May with Sinasa, a Brazilian chemicals group.
Sinasa's Celbras subsidiary ran up debts of around Dollars 200m to pay for
expansion of its polyester resins and returnable bottles production.
The pricing was being finalised in Paris yesterday by the company and global
co-ordinator, Paribas Capital Markets. The global depositary shares will be
listed on the US Portal system and the Luxembourg stock exchange. Shares
will also be listed in Brazil.
