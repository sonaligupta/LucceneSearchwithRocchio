FT  15 JUN 93 / Small business hit by crime


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR


NEARLY HALF of all small businesses have been the victims of crime,
according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business.
Of 2,670 companies surveyed 45 per cent had been affected by crime. Burglary
was the most common problem, affecting 45 per cent of the victims. It was
followed by vandalism (31 per cent), theft (27 per cent), vehicle crime (24
per cent), shoplifting (17 per cent), and fraud (11 per cent).
In a follow-up poll, 90 per cent of business owners called for greater
powers for the police and courts. The forum, which has nearly 21,000
members, has requested a meeting with the home secretary to discuss the
findings of its survey.
Finance firms were the most common targets for burglary, with 71 per cent of
those hit by crime suffering a burglary, followed by manufacturing and
wholesale (57 per cent). Construction and retail businesses suffered most
from vandalism, which affected 36 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.
Businesses employing fewer than four people were least affected by crime and
were most satisfied with the police. The smallest businesses suffered most
from shoplifting and fraud, while medium-sized firms were disproportionately
affected by vehicle-related crime, theft and vandalism.
Crime affected more businesses (59 per cent) in the north of England than in
any other region and satisfaction with the police was lowest.
