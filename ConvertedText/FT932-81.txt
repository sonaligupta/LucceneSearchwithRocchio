   FRANKFURT


COMMERZBANK, Germany's third-largest private sector commercial bank, is
diversifying into the French asset management market with the acquisition of
Caisse Centrale de Reescompte, a bank owned by Groupe Paribas.
Commerzbank did not disclose the purchase price but is believed to have paid
more than DM100m (Dollars 60.2m) for CCR, one of France's leading
independent fund managers, with FFr16bn under management, 21 funds and
almost 400 institutional clients.
CCR has a full banking licence and is involved in money market and foreign
exchange activities for financial institutions.
At the end of last year CCR's balance sheet total was FFr17.8bn.
Commerzbank said the purchase would complement the activities of its
existing Paris branch (opened in 1976) as well as Commerz International
Capital Management, a Frankfurt-based subsidiary which specialises in fund
management for non-German clients.
The cross-border deals extend to the insurance sector as well: on Monday,
Assurances Generales de France, the large French insurer, disclosed that it
had taken its stake in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs from 25 to around
33.5 per cent, strengthening its ties with Germany's second biggest
insurance group.
