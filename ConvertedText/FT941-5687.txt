FT  04 MAR 94 / Survey of World Tyre Industry (7): Spinning wheel of
misfortune - The Japanese crisis and the effect on other Asian nations


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


The Japanese tyre industry, Asia's largest, is in a spin. The sector is
suffering from a massive collapse in demand caused by the worst domestic
recession since 1945. Simultaneously, high costs and the inexorable rise of
the yen is undermining the ability of Japanese tyre manufacturers to export
their way out of trouble.
The crisis threatens to create a fundamental shift in production from Japan
to other Asian countries. The trend is part of a more general trend of
'hollowing out' of Japanese industry, as manufacturers relocate production
in the low-cost fast-growing Asian markets.
The decline of the Japanese tyre market, the world's second biggest, has
been precipitous. Last year was the third that demand and production fell
and the drop last year was the worst on record. Output has fallen from a
peak of 166.7m tyres in 1989 to less than 150m units last year. Meanwhile,
the amount of rubber consumed has dropped from 1.031m tonnes in 1990 to
922,000 tonnes in 1993, according to the Japan Automobile Tire
Manufacturers' Association (Jatma).
The sector has been undermined by a collapse in demand in both the original
equipment market - supplying domestic car manufacturers - and in the
domestic replacement market. Tyre shipments to domestic vehicle constructors
fell 12.1 per cent last year to 50m units. That fall mirrors a 10.2 per cent
drop in Japanese vehicle production, according to data released by the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Meanwhile, the collapse in the
replacement market has exacerbated the industry's plight. Sales fell from
67.6m in 1992 to 60.9m last year.
Imports have also been adding to Japanese manufacturers' woes. Although
imports fell about 5 per cent to slightly less than 14m units last year,
they nevertheless increased market share in a falling market.
In spite of the massive overcapacity, no Japanese manufacturers have closed
plants over the past 12 months. However, Mr Akira Suzuki, Jatma's executive
director, says extended maintenance periods have cut operating rates from
more than 90 per cent in 1992 to just over 80 per cent last year.
The leading Japanese manufacturers include Bridgestone, with about between
45 and 50 per cent of the market, Yokohama Rubber (about 20 per cent),
Sumitomo/Dunlop (about 20 per cent), Toyo Tire & Rubber (about 10 per cent)
A sense of crisis has been created in the industry, not only because of the
drop in output, but also falling prices and shift in product mix as
consumers demand greater value for money. Bridgestone says the price
structure has been deteriorating quite quickly.
Most worrying for the industry has been the fundamental shift in consumer
attitudes in the replacement market. Whereas in the past Japanese consumers
almost unquestioningly bought the most expensive brands, this is no longer
the case.
'Consumer behaviour has changed very fast since the depression. Shoppers are
shopping around and brand loyalty has been weakened. This is very new for
the market,' says Mr Pierre Sivan, president of Nippon Goodyear. He explains
that Japanese consumers tend to buy four replacement tyres at a time and
that consumers no longer feel as obliged as they were to substitute the
original fit with the same brand.
New ranges of high-performance intermediate tyres have proved highly
successful over the past three or four years, according to Mr Sivan. These
have captured about 70 per cent of the high performance sector which
represents about 15 per cent of the entire passenger tyre market.
However, these intermediate tyres, which are between 10 per cent and 15 per
cent cheaper than the top-performance products, have not been immune from
price cuts. In January, when new lines were introduced, the new products
came in at the existing price, and the old products were further discounted
by about 10 per cent, says Mr Sivan.
Further evidence of the change in consumer attitudes is the rapid growth of
mass merchandisers such as Autobacs and Yellow Hat. These up-market stores,
which stock tyres, wheels and in-car entertainment systems, do not offer
significant discounts to traditional mom-and-pop shops, according to Mr
Sivan. However, they offer a huge product range against which small local
suppliers find it difficult to compete. 'These don't look like a place for
tyre-kickers,' explains Mr Sivan.
The growth of mass merchandisers has been swift. Estimates of their present
market share range from 15 per cent to 20 per cent, compared with only 7 per
cent five years ago.
The increasing concentration of distribution channels could help foreign
manufacturers such as Michelin and Goodyear, which have paltry market shares
given their size elsewhere.
First, manufacturers marketing to mass merchandisers do not require the huge
sales forces traditionally required to reach traditional tyre retailers.
Second, the merchandisers are beginning to develop their own brands which
could be manufactured by foreign groups.
'Non-Japanese companies have a window of opportunity in Japan that they have
not had for years,' says Mr Sivan. 'Most of the handicaps we have had have
not disappeared, but are nevertheless no longer as significant as they
were.'
The main disadvantage for foreign groups has been the absence of local
manufacturing, says Mr Sivan. But Japanese companies are now looking
increasingly at locating their own manufacturing elsewhere in Asia.
Japanese groups' manufacturing is being driven overseas by the rapid growth
of the consumer markets in Asia, the location of automotive manufacturing
there, and the low costs of operation. Labour costs, which represent about
50 per cent of manufacturing costs, are particularly less expensive outside
Japan. One manufacturer estimates the cost of labour in China is 1 per cent
of Japanese levels.
Bridgestone, Asia's largest producer, already has plants in Taiwan,
Indonesia and Thailand. It is opening a construction plant in Thailand that
should increase its local production by 35 per cent. The group is also in
the process of doubling capacity in Indonesia. The company says it is now
turning its attention to rapidly developing markets such as China, Vietnam
and India.
Mr Sivan at Goodyear says the opportunities in China are immense. But it is
important for western groups to be vigilant about Japan, which remains and
will remain Asia's most important market for many years.
