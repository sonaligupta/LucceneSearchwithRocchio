FT  27 JAN 94 / Travel on roads made safer


People in Britain travel an average of almost 200 kilometres (125 miles) a
week.
Rail, bus and coach fares increased by more than 130 per cent between 1981
and 1993, compared with 80 per cent for motoring costs. Road travel became
safer as well as relatively cheaper - there were just over 4,000 road deaths
in 1992, less than half the record 9,000 in 1941.
