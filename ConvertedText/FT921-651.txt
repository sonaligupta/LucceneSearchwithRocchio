FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Weir to Pounds 34m


   By PETER MARTIN


WEIR Group, the Glasgow-based engineer, yesterday displayed cautious
optimism while reporting a 26 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1991 and
a 14 per cent rise in the final dividend.
'Our order book is good, demand is holding up, and we have a strong
financial position,' said Lord Weir, chairman.
He added that, despite a difficult economic background, he was 'fairly
optimistic that we can continue the momentum of the last few years.'
Profits for the 52 weeks to December 27 rose from Pounds 27.2m to Pounds
34.2m on turnover up 33 per cent to Pounds 424.1m (Pounds 318.9m).
Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 32.1p (28.8p) and the final dividend
of 7.4p (6.5p) makes a 10.5p (9.3p) total.
Mr Ron Garrick, managing director, said half the rise in turnover came from
acquisitions - including the full-year benefit of purchases made in 1990.
The other half came from growth in the company's basic business.
New orders in 1991 rose 38 per cent to Pounds 474m, divided evenly between
the company's five main markets - the oil industry, marine, water supply and
sewage, general industrial and power generation.
The biggest single order was a contract for a desalination plant in Dubai,
worth Pounds 23m.
The main division, engineering products, increased turnover by 42 per cent
to Pounds 342.4m and pre-tax profits by 40.2 per cent to Pounds 14.2m. At
the smaller engineering services division, pre-tax profits were flat at
Pounds 12.5m.
Net cash at year-end stood at Pounds 46m compared with Pounds 33m at
end-1990.
COMMENT
The company's decision, born of desperation in the last recession, to move
towards more specialised, 'difficult' technologies has paid off in two ways.
Despite a slight dip in margins, Weir has remained immune, so far, from the
worst of the industry's price pressures. And the niches it chose - including
gas turbine power generation, the oil industry and water treatment - have
all continued to grow briskly. The company is confident that it can keep a
cost advantage over German rivals at DM2.95 to the pound, and the steady
flow of small acquisitions is likely to continue. Worries include the
possibility that continental competitors will slash prices to keep order
books full if the German slowdown worsens. The share price has outperformed
the sector by 195 per cent in the last five years and 9 per cent in the past
month. With Pounds 40m profits likely in 1992, the stock is fairly priced on
a prospective p/e of 14, above the sector average but not out of line with
the market as a whole.
