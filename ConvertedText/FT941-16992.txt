FT  06 JAN 94 / Bulgarian interest rates surge


   By REUTER


   SOFIA


Bulgaria's central bank yesterday nearly doubled the interest rate on
short-term deposits to defend the plummeting national currency, Reuter
reports from Sofia.
The Bulgarian National Bank increased interest rates on one-week deposits by
commercial banks to 53 per cent from 27 per cent to support the lev, after
the currency hit a record low of 35 levs to the dollar.
Strong dollar demand has seen the lev fall 6.14 per cent in a week and by
43.15 per cent in the past year.
