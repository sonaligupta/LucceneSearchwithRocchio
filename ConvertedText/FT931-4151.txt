FT  12 MAR 93 / Lord Chancellor acted unfairly in competitive tendering
exercise


LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, acted unfairly in the competitive
tendering exercise which led to contracts being awarded for shorthand
writing services in a group of courts in England, the High Court ruled
yesterday.
Lord Justice Rose and Mr Justice Waller expressed sympathy for the victims
but said they had no jurisdiction to declare what had happened unlawful.
The ruling was a test-case application for judicial review by Hibbit and
Sanders, one of the oldest firms of official shorthand writers in the
country. The firm challenged Lord Mackay's decision to award a rival bidder
the three-year contract starting in April for the Chelmsford group of crown
courts, in which it has operated since 1907.
Lord Justice Rose said the Lord Chancellor's Department had allowed some
companies which were seeking contracts to cover courts in England and Wales
to put in second, lower bids, while denying other tenderers, including
Hibbit and Sanders, the same opportunity.
