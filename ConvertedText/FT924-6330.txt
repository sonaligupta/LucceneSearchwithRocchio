FT  21 NOV 92 / Finance & The Family: At A Glance - Gloom for British Steel


British Steel shares slumped to an all-time low this week after it declared
a first half loss of Pounds 51m and omitted its interim dividend. When the
company was privatised in 1988, it was perceived as an income stock. Its
shares were trading at around 50p yesterday, compared with 125p on
flotation.
