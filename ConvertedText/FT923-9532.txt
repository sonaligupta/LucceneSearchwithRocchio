FT  05 AUG 92 / Sharp fall in Indian industrial production

INDUSTRIAL production in India declined sharply during the first year of the
country's new economic reforms. The index fell from 7.8 per cent in
1990-1991 to -0.1 per cent in 1991-1992, according to a confidential
Ministry of Industry report.
The report shows that manufacturing contracted 1.7 per cent, with the
sharpest fall in the capital goods sector - a decline of 12.8 per cent over
last year - while consumer durables posted a fall of 12.5 per cent.
After a decade of high industrial growth, the recession is being attributed
to the macro-stabilisation programme stipulated by the IMF in July last
year, which forced India to cut back sharply on capital expenditure. This as
exacerbated by a credit squeeze and a high rate of inflation (currently 13
per cent) which reduced demand for industrial products.
Exports have been adversely affected by global recession and the
disintegration of the Soviet Union, with which India had a rupee trade
agreement.
Estimates show that industrial growth in the first two months (April and
May) of the current financial year remained sluggish at 0.6 per cent. A
growth rate of 5.9 per cent was recorded in the corresponding period of last
year.
