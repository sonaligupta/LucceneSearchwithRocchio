FT  27 MAR 92 / Companies are criticised over accounts


   By ANDREW JACK


MANY companies are failing to comply with accounting standards, the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales alleged yesterday.
It said more than a third of companies whose annual reports suggested that
they had incurred expenditure on research and development did not give the
relevant figures even though accounting standards say they should be
disclosed. Disclosure levels by many companies and the quality of
information given leave much to be desired, the institute said after
publishing its 23rd annual survey of financial information.
It added that accounting standards had proved less effective than
legislation in persuading companies to comply with professional requirements
on financial reporting. The survey covered the accounts of 300 companies
with reporting years ending in June last year.
Eight per cent of the companies did not provide data on pension costs as
required by an accounting standard, the institute reported.
Since the passage of the 1989 Companies Act, which echoes EC legislation and
includes provisions to increase the number of subsidiaries consolidated into
group accounts, only 5 per cent of all companies and 1 per cent of large
listed companies still exclude subsidiaries from consolidation.
The institute found that the number of large companies disclosing detailed
pension information had fallen.
Only 68 per cent of large companies published the actuarial assumptions on
the rate of return on investments, and 65 per cent the rate of increase of
future salaries, compared with 92 per cent and 89 per cent respectively in
the previous year.
The analysis raises questions about the policy of using accounting standards
drafted and implemented by the accountancy profession to govern financial
reporting.
Mr David Tonkin, one of the authors of the survey, said the current standard
of financial reporting deserved 'eight out of 10 - must try harder.'
The institute said reporting on environmental matters remained principally a
'public relations exercise'. It urged companies to show greater willingness
to submit their environmental practices to external scrutiny and to devise
better ways of assessing the effects of company activity on the environment.
