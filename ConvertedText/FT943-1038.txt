FT  26 SEP 94 / Slovaks warm to privatisation

More than half a million people have registered to buy shares through
Slovakia's voucher privatisation programme since its launch three weeks ago
by a government which hopes privatisation will prove a vote winner at next
weekend's general elections. The Slovak coalition parties hope that this
privatisation will take votes away from Mr Vladimir Meciar, the populist
leader of the opposition, who has threatened to scrap the programme if his
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia wins the election.
Fifty thousand books of vouchers, each valued at Kcs1,000 (Pounds 20.50),
are being sold every day, the privatisation minister, Mr Milan Janicina,
said recently. Three quarters of Slovakia's 5.3m people are eligible to take
part in the programme which involves the sale of stakes in 136 state-owned
companies with a total value of Kcs44.8bn. More are expected to be included
before the elections. However, the government's original target of approving
Kcs80bn of assets for voucher privatisation before the election will not be
met.
