FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers aim to ease EC fine print


   By ALISON SMITH


THE UK government is considering how it might ease up on the fine print of
European Community directives, in spite of its drive during its presidency
of the Community to spread good enforcement practice on EC-wide law.
The foreign office is leading a discussion within Whitehall of ways to bring
greater flexibility into the UK's approach to its Community
responsibilities.
Until now, British anger at the relaxed view it sees some other member
states taking of implementing EC law has been intensified by the UK's own
record of conscientious enforcement.
It was British pressure that led to the inclusion in the Maastricht
agreement of provisions enabling the European Court of Justice to fine
member countries that fail to obey EC rules.
Such pressure also led to a declaration of the importance of each EC country
'fully and accurately' putting EC directives into national law within
specified deadlines.
British ministers emphasise that there is no question of a decision not to
enact EC provisions, but suggest there is a strong case for not being so
punctilious in setting out the details of how a particular directive can be
met and how its implementation can be monitored and inspected.
The question of 'over-implementation' is especially acute where
responsibility for ensuring compliance with the law lies with local
authorities.
Central government's attention to detail in devising guidance for local
councils in, for example, areas such as environmental health, can lead to
extra bureaucracy both for the council and for the businesses they have to
regulate.
The move would sit well with the government's present emphasis on
deregulation to reduce the burdens on business, and might easily form the
Foreign Office's main contribution to the initiative, since there is little
legislation for which it is directly responsible.
