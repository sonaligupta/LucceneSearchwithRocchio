FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Western Mining defers expansion
at Kimbalda

WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, yesterday
said a proposed ADollars 105m (USDollars 80.1m) expansion at its Kambalda
nickel operations would be postponed, in spite of legislation relaxing
restrictions on working hours.
The project has been abandoned or postponed several times over the last year
as WMC pursued talks with the miners' union for a switch from five-day to
seven-day continuous mining.
The group reached agreement with the union last month after a series of
strikes and other disruptions to production. But the agreement was
conditional on the passage of amendments to mining legislation through the
Western Australian state parliament.
The amendments were approved on Thursday, but only after the government had
added a further clause giving the state's mining minister the right to
change permissible hours at his discretion.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the additional amendment was
'anything but acceptable'.
The project is part of an ADollars 400m programme to boost group nickel
output from 53,000 to 65,000 tonnes a year.
