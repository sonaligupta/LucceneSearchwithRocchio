FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Cincinnati Milacron rises 30% to
Dollars 7.9m


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Cincinnati Milacron, the US machine tool and plastics machinery producer,
lifted second-quarter earnings by nearly 30 per cent and announced its best
quarter for new orders.
Net profits were Dollars 7.9m, or 23 cents a share, compared with profits
before extraordinary items of Dollars 6.2m, or 19 cents, in 1993. Sales
advanced to Dollars 269.3m from Dollars 236.6m.
New orders totalled Dollars 302m, against Dollars 232m a year ago and
Dollars 267m in the first quarter of this year. Orders exceeded shipments
causing the backlog to grow to Dollars 299m, up more than Dollars 50m so far
this year.
Mr Daniel Meyer, chairman and chief executive, conceded that part of the
increase in new business came from the recently acquired Ferramatik, a
German producer of injection moulding machines.
Second-quarter machine tool sales fell year-on-year to Dollars 67m from
Dollars 78m, and the business had an operating loss of Dollars 900,000,
against operating profits of Dollars 1.6m a year ago.
Six month profits were Dollars 12.9m or 37 cents, compared with Dollars 9.8m
or 32 cents. That was before extraordinary items - mainly accounting changes
 -which left Milacron with a Dollars 46.8m net loss.
