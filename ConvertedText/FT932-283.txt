FT  29 JUN 93 / FT Exporter (11): Persistent and ingenious


EMPLOYING a Swiss consultant to advise on continental European meat cuts;
having products assessed to several national standards; becoming a permanent
feature at international trade fairs.
Export sales require ingenuity and persistence, to judge by this year's
winners of the Export Award for Smaller Businesses.
The five winners were:
Donald Russell, a supplier of Aberdeen Angus beef, Scottish lamb, salmon,
bacon and game to hotels and restaurants throughout Europe and the Far East.
The company, based in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, has built up a network of
overseas wholesalers over the past two years but last December also opened
its own office. Exports account for all but Pounds 400,000 of its Pounds
6.9m sales.
Desurvey has paid particular attention to its credit control systems so as
to obtain competitive funding for the engineering design services it
provides for the offshore and petrochemical industries. Based in Birkenhead,
it makes export sales of Pounds 6.2m out of a total Pounds 6.8m.
Mayflower Glass, a Tyneside-based manufacturer of glass sculptures, stresses
detailed market research and language skills - staff speak seven languages -
as important factors in winning exports. Exports account for nearly 70 per
cent of total sales of Pounds 3.65m.
BCB International, a supplier of safety and survival equipment, says its
staff attend about 15 exhibitions a year a well as making regular overseas
visits to customers. A family company based in Cardiff, it makes Pounds 2.4m
worth of exports out of total sales of Pounds 3.7m.
Technic Group (see profile), a manufacturer of retreaded tyres, has to pay
particular attention to quality and safety standards but has benefited from
a growing awareness of the environmental advantages of its products.
