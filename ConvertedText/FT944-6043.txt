FT  01 DEC 94 / Italian strike in balance


   By ROBERT GRAHAM


   ROME


The Italian government and union leaders were close to agreement late last
night in talks designed to head off an eight-hour general strike tomorrow.
Both sides appeared anxious to avoid the inevitable increase in social
tension that would ensue from the general strike, which was called to
protest against pension cuts in the 1995 budget. Mr Clemente Mastella, the
labour minister and chief proponent of a deal with the unions, threatened to
resign if the talks - which had begun at 10am - failed.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, was mandated on Tuesday to
negotiate with the unions on the basis of a broad-ranging document. This
sought to address union concerns not only about cutting pension benefits but
also on a wide range of issues including new incentives for job creation in
the south and more help for research and development projects. In the run-up
to yesterday's meeting the government had given conflicting signals over its
willingness to compromise. But the bottom line, according to the treasury,
would have to be the maintenance of the principal 1995 budget objectives in
holding down the deficit to L138,000bn (Pounds 54.6bn), equivalent to 8 per
cent of GDP.
