FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Surge in investment income
boosts AMP

Australian Mututal Provident Society, the large life insurance group and one
of the country's biggest institutional investors, said yesterday it had
after-tax operating earnings of ADollars 2.11bn (USDollars 1.5bn) in 1993.
This figure, however, included investment income of ADollars 7.35bn, of
which ADollars 5.12bn was derived from the net appreciation of investment
assets. The insurer attributed the rise largely to the strong performance of
the Australian stock market last year.
The figure only reflected AMP's Australian and New Zealand operations, and
excluded its sizeable interests in the UK, which include the Pearl and
London Life. The mutual insurer did not provide an earnings figure for the
group overall, but did say total premium income for the consolidated
business stood at ADollars 7.28bn last year, slightly below the 1992 figure
of ADollars 7.9bn. Total investment income surged to ADollars 13.7bn from
ADollars 4.33bn, again largely due to investment portfolio gains.
There was also a sharp rise in surrenders, policies which are prematurely
cashed in by policy-holders. These cost AMP ADollars 3.8bn overall last
year, up from ADollars 2.73bn in the previous 12 months.
There is much discussion over how life companies' profits should be reported
in Australia, and AMP acknowledged that its 1993 earnings figure would have
been significantly higher if it had adopted the basis used by some other
large Australian insurers.
AMP also made clear yesterday it had no intention of 'demutualising' - that
is, turning itself into a share-holder-owned company - despite the fact that
this has become an increasingly popular option for mutuals.
