FT  13 APR 92 / UK Company News: Groupe Victoire slows fall in earnings

GROUPE Victoire, the French insurance company owned by Compagnie Financiere
de Suez, staged a modest recovery from a steep fall in profits during the
first half of 1991 to report a slight reduction in net profits of 1.7 per
cent to FFr1.81bn (Dollars 320m) for the full year.
During the first half of 1991, Victoire experienced a 33 per cent decline in
net profits to FFr924m because of a reduction in exceptional gains. The
company had benefited from substantial asset sales in the first half of 1990
to fund the acquisition of Colonia, the German insurance group.
The company made a mild recovery in the second half, but did not achieve the
goal outlined by Mr Jean Arvis, chairman, when the interim results were
published, of equalling or slightly increasing its 1990 profits.
Victoire said yesterday it had been affected by the global downturn in the
insurance market during 1991, particularly by the increase in business
claims in France and Germany.
The group's turnover rose by 9.7 per cent to FFr64bn in 1991. Net profits
before paying minority interests rose by 2.9 per cent to FFr2.2bn. The board
proposed raising the dividend from FFr15 in 1990 to FFr19.50 for 1991.
