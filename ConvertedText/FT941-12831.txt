FT  28 JAN 94 / Shephard defends milk policy


The government came under fire in the Commons yesterday over the delay in
opening up the milk market in England and Wales to competition.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said getting the scheme right
was more important than meeting deadlines. She was answering questions a day
after the Commons agriculture committee announced plans to examine why
liberalisation had been postponed until November.
Her assurances were brushed aside by opposition MPs, with Labour saying the
government should accept responsibility for the 'disarray' in the market.
