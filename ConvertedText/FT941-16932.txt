FT  07 JAN 94 / Dearing denies reports on vocational courses


Sir Ron Dearing yesterday firmly denied reports that the vocational courses
he has recommended for 14-year-olds would include plumbing and bricklaying.
Addressing the North of England Education Conference in Chester, he said:
'My thinking is essentially down the route of general vocational
qualifications where there is a mixture of the applied and the conceptual -
broad subjects such as art and design or leisure and tourism. Not plumbing.
That's not what I had in mind at all.'
He suggested that pupils learning an applied subject such as tourism and
leisure would need to master aspects of geography, foreign languages and
communication skills. He denied the measure would introduce academic
selection at the age of 14 and said good vocational courses could 'switch
some pupils on' and develop their academic education.
He added that schools would not in any case have the resources to teach
subjects as practical as bricklaying, but encouraged them to form links with
further education colleges to ensure that the vocational work for
14-year-olds would be of a high standard.
