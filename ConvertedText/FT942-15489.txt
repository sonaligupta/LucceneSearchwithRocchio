FT  15 APR 94 / EU 'must reach out to E Europe'


   By DAVID GARDNER

The European Union must set up new structures to assist the integration of
central Europe, according to a report for the European Commission published
today by Mr Richard Baldwin of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the
independent think-tank.
Mr Baldwin says present arrangements consist of bilateral Association
Agreements which link the central Europeans separately to the EU. These
allow limited access to the EU market, but do nothing to promote
intra-central European trade and consequently inhibit investment in the
region.
Beyond the association agreements lies the far horizon of EU membership,
promised for an unspecified future at last year's Copenhagen summit of Union
heads of government. But in between these, Mr Baldwin said, 'there is
nothing to get us from here to there.'
He argues that two concentric circles should be built around the EU core
gradually to integrate central Europe.
The outer circle would comprise all central Europe and would create a
duty-free zone for industrial products.
A second circle would spread the single market to the EU for front-runners
like Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics.
