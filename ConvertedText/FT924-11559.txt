FT  24 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Recovering excess tax


I AM AN Australian national who will be returning home after working and
paying taxes in the UK for the past five years and I wish to know how to
recover excess tax paid in this financial year. My wife is English and will
be emigrating with me.
My wife and I will be leaving full time work having earned approximately
Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 8,000 gross respectively. I have also made capital
gains of Pounds 2,500 on the sale of shares and would make further gains of
approximately Pounds 4,000 if shares I currently hold are sold at current
prices (I do not wish to sell these shares for some years, however).
We have both been paying into a private pension scheme for some years and
are able to take a 'pension payments holiday' upon leaving the UK. As the
total amount in these pension schemes is small, would it be advisable to opt
back into the state scheme, thereby making us eligible for a state pension
should we choose to return to the UK later, or, having taken private
pensions, are we now honour-bound to claim our pension solely from this
source?
A. Regarding PAYE on current year's earnings, you should approach your local
Inspector of Taxes regarding repayments that may be due in respect of the
current tax year. The capital gain is irrelevant because it is only realised
gains (ie when you actually sell the shares) that enter into your tax
computation.
B. As regards your personal pension policies, these should be paid up and
retained as an investment with the insurer in question. When you eventually
retire, whether in the UK or Australia, the relevant sums can be paid to
you. Should you return to the UK at some future date then you can decide
afresh what to do about future service, ie whether to remain in the state
scheme or contract-out.
