FT  17 JAN 92 / Training for Soviet personnel urged


   By PETER NORMAN


MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, is asking financial, insurance and legal
companies to provide vocational training for 1,000 people from the former
Soviet Union for between six months and a year, Peter Norman writes.
The Treasury announced yesterday that the government will organise and fund
the administration of the scheme in association with the British Council, at
a cost of about Pounds 8m.
The move follows a plea by Mr Lamont to City companies last October to take
personnel from the former Soviet Union into their offices so that they could
learn about the workings of a market economy with a modern financial centre.
The move was welcomed by Sir John Banham, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry. He said yesterday that the CBI and the
British Council had helped provide training for 60 managers from industrial
companies in the former communist states of Europe and was in the process of
placing a further 400 to 500 in training schemes this year.
