FT  17 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar holds on to new gains


   By SIMON LONDON


The dollar shook off profit-taking pressures yesterday to retain most of the
gains made in its spectacular rally on Tuesday and Wednesday, writes Simon
London.
In Far Eastern trading the dollar began to slip back from the high levels
seen in New York on Wednesday, as some dealers took profits on long dollar
positions held since last week.
However, there was support at around the DM1.6150 and Y127.50 levels as
operators with an optimistic view of the prospects for the US currency
stepped in. By the close in Tokyo, the US unit stood at DM1.6225, from
DM1.6235 in New York, and Y128.43, from Y128.55.
However, selling pressures again emerged in early European trading. The
dollar was pushed down to DM1.6065 and Y127.65 at one stage before
rebounding.
In addition to profit-taking pressures, traders said rumours that the Group
of Seven industrial countries will intervene to cap the rapid appreciation
of the dollar had blunted positive sentiment.
Yet no central bank intervention was forthcoming and central banking sources
made no overt comments on currency rates. By mid-morning in London, the US
unit had been pushed back up over DM1.6150 and Y128, levels maintained
through most of the afternoon session.
The dollar dipped briefly on the announcement of US inflation data for
December which was broadly in line with expectations but underlined that the
monetary authorities have room to lower interest rates again.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 per cent in the month, against
expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise, bringing inflation to a year-on-year
rate of 3.1 per cent for the whole of 1991, from 6.1 per cent in 1990.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.6185, from DM1.6220 on Wednesday, and
Y128.30 from Y128.40.
Analysts said that the US currency is now constrained within a DM1.6280 to
DM1.60 range, with little clear direction. The rally last week and this week
was driven largely by technical trading by intermediaries, with little
change in the underlying economic fundamentals. Until some more conclusive
economic data is released, the prospects for the dollar will remain clouded.
Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling remained the weakest
currency, pinned to the outer limit of its permitted divergence from the
Spanish peseta, the strongest currency.
Sterling traded within a narrow range between DM2.8450 and DM2.85 for most
of the day, pushing up above DM2.85 in late afternoon and closing at DM2.85
exactly, from DM2.8475 on Wednesday.
However, this remained only just above the UK currency's effective floor
within the ERM. The Spanish currency also appreciated slightly against the
D-Mark, closing as Pta63.43 from DM63.495 on Wednesday, lifting the floor
for sterling.
