FT  05 AUG 93 / People: Cunningham moves to UBS


Adrian Cunningham, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, is moving
across to UBS where he becomes senior currency economist. He will report to
Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research, and replaces Avinash
Persaud who departed for JP Morgan at the end of June.
With the virtual collapse of the ERM, there is plenty of scope for currency
forecasters to shine at present. Coincidentally or not, recent months have
seen a brisk trade in economists in general between a number of City
institutions.
Cunningham, 31, has spent four years at B of A, which is ranked tenth in
interbank foreign exchange and 12th in currency dealings on behalf of
customers, according to Euromoney. UBS ranks third for interbank
transactions, but ninth for customers. Jeremy Hawkins, B of A's chief
economic adviser in London, says he and Cunningham have been 'reasonably
bearish' as regards the fate of the ERM over the past six months.
Before his stint at B of A, Cunningham was the Reserve Bank of Australia's
economist in London for a couple of years. In a rather unusual path to the
City's frenetic dealing rooms, he had previously graduated from Leicester
Poly, taken an MA in economics at Manchester University, worked for South
Glamorgan Health Authority and then taught economics to A-level and Oxbridge
candidates at Portsmouth grammar school.
