FT  21 JUL 94 / Major's reshuffle: Cranborne treads 'king-maker' path


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


With his appointment as the new leader of the House of Lords, Viscount
Cranborne takes another step along the political path traversed by his
grandfather, the Fifth Marquess of Salisbury, who was the Conservative
party's 'king-maker' in the 1950s.
Lord Cranborne's rapid advance from the ranks of the junior ministers to a
seat in the cabinet reflects his impressive performance as the government's
chief defence spokesman in the Lords since 1992.
His entry to the Lords was accelerated, again like that of his grandfather,
to strengthen a politically-fragile government front bench.
Lord Cranborne, who is 47, had an undistinguished spell in the Commons from
1979 to 1987 as Conservative MP for Dorset south - a constituency his
grandfather represented in the 1930s. Lord Cranborne takes up the post of
leader of the Lords - with the ministerial title of Lord Privy Seal - at a
time when the flaws in bills at the heart of the government's programme,
particularly on law and order, have been ruthlessly exposed.
His main task will be to satisfy independent-minded Tory back benchers, the
former law lords and other well-informed peers, who play an active role from
the cross-benches, that there will be no repetition of the recent flood of
ill-digested legislation.
The Marquess of Salisbury played his 'king-maker' role in 1957. His
interrogation of the Cabinet virtually decided that Harold Macmillan, rather
than R A Butler, should succeed Sir Anthony Eden as prime minister.
