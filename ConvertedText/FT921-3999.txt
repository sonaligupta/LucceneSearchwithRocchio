FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Reforms will help small
family companies - Inheritance Tax


THE Budget proposals for inheritance tax are for an increase in the higher
rate of business and agricultural relief from 50 per cent to 100 per cent,
an increase in the lower rate of business and agricultural relief from 30
per cent to 50 per cent, and treating companies on the Unlisted Securities
Market (USM) like unquoted companies.
The proposed measures will benefit about 2,000 businesses and farms a year,
many of them small family concerns, enabling many of them to be inherited
free of any inheritance tax charge.
Business and agricultural relief reduces the value of business assets and
farmland for inheritance tax (IHT) purposes. The current rates of relief are
30 per cent or 50 per cent, depending on the type of asset or the beneficial
interest.
Under the chancellor's proposals the new 100 per cent rate will apply to
interests in unincorporated businesses, holdings above 25 per cent in
unquoted companies, holdings above 25 per cent in USM companies,
owner-occupied farmlands and farm tenancies.
The new 50 per cent rate will apply to controlling holdings in fully quoted
companies, holdings of 25 per cent or less without control in unquoted
companies, holdings of 25 per cent or less without control in USM companies,
certain assets owned by partners and used in their partnership or owned by
controlling shareholders and used in their company, and interests of
landlords in let farmland.
At present controlling holdings in USM companies qualify for 50 per cent
relief and other holdings get no relief. Under the Chancellor's proposals
USM holdings of more than 25 per cent will be eligible for relief at 100 per
cent and smaller holdings will qualify for relief at 50 per cent.
Controlling holdings in fully quoted companies at present qualify for 50 per
cent relief. This will remain unchanged.
The changes to business and agricultural relief will apply to tax charges
arising on or after March 10 1992.
The changes will apply both to transfers of value made on or after March 10
1992 and to charges or further charges arising on a death on or after March
10 1992 in respect of a transfer of value made before that date.
