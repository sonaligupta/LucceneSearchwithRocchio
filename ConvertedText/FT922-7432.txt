FT  19 MAY 92 / Ulster search for stolen gun


SECURITY forces in Ulster yesterday continued to search for a heavy-calibre
machine gun stolen during confrontations in Coalisland, Tyrone, which
culminated in the shooting of three civilians by members of the Parachute
Regiment.
During the violence the machine gun, capable of firing 1,000 rounds a
minute, and a rifle, were taken from soldiers. The rifle was later
recovered.
Security sources said the Parachute Regiment had been withdrawn from
Coalisland but would retain overall responsibility for East Tyrone.
