FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kraft takes control of 75% of
Freia Marabou

KRAFT General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris group of the
US, has gained control of more than 75 per cent of the share capital of
Freia Marabou, Scandinavia's biggest chocolate producer. KGFI last month
offered Dollars 1.5bn, or NKr450 a share, to acquire Freia but needed
two-thirds acceptances for the deal to go through.
The only remaining obstacle for KGFI to clear is approval by the industry
ministry which is required under foreign ownership laws.
Freia is to become part of KGFI's Jacobs Suchard group and is to be named
Freia Marabou Suchard.
Hershey Foods of the US had its Dollars 1.3bn bid rejected by Freia's main
shareholders. Hershey owns a 18.6 per cent stake in Freia Marabou but has
yet to deliver a rival bid for the company which it earlier said it would do
jointly with Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group which has main interests
in branded foods.
