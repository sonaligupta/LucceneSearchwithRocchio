FT  30 JAN 92 / Customs launches Traveller's Charter


   By JOHN WILLMAN


MEASURES TO speed up clearance through customs for people entering the UK
were announced yesterday, with the publication by Customs & Excise of a
Traveller's Charter, John Willman writes.
The charter sets out the standards to which customs officers will work and
promises surveys of performance. A training programme has been created to
ensure that service is 'courteous and helpful'.
Officers who normally deal with the public will wear name badges unless the
nature of their duties would make this unsafe. Greater publicity will be
given to the complaints procedure under which compensation is payable if
belongings are damaged.
Among moves to speed up clearance times are a target of a maximum of 10
minutes waiting to declare goods and more 'red points' where air travellers
can declare goods and pay duty while waiting for their baggage to be
unloaded.
Ministers are also arguing for an increase in the value of duty-free goods
which can be imported from countries outside the EC.
