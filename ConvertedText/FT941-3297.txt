FT  16 MAR 94 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (34):
Quicker calls for Whitehall


   By MICHAEL WILTSHIRE


GPT Communication Systems has won a large order from the Central Computer
Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) for the supply, installation and
maintenance of a new computerised telephone directory serving all 62
government departments in Whitehall.
The new system enables operators based in the Treasury to reduce response
times significantly for about 5,000 enquiries each working day.
Mr Peter Spencer of the telecommunications division of the CCTA, explains:
'With over 30,000 people working in more than 60 different departments, our
original system of using up to 12 paper directories had become too slow and
cumbersome, with an average response time of 25 seconds - too high for what
is essentially a public service.'
The new system allows the CCTA to locate individuals and redirect calls in a
fraction of the time, eliminating caller-frustration, he adds.
