FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Adia slides to SFr42m despite
cost reductions

ADIA, the Swiss-based inter-national employment services group, yesterday
announced sharply lower profits for 1991 as the recession in North America
and Europe squeezed margins and hampered the group's ambitious programme to
sell off non-core businesses.
Net consolidated earnings, calculated on a 1990 basis before divestments,
fell to SFr42.5m (Dollars 29.9m) from SFr115.4m in 1990, on slightly lower
group revenues, down to SFr4.04bn from SFr4.11bn the previous year.
Net earnings of the parent company, Adia Holding, amounted to SFr5m for the
six months to end-December, against zero in the year to end-June. The
company will again recommend to shareholders that no dividend be paid.
Operating profits of Adia's employment services business, where it ranks
number two in the world behind Manpower of the US, fell to SFr43m in 1991
from SFr149m in 1990. Despite the recession, turnover fell only modestly,
from SFr3.3bn in 1990 to SFr3.2bn in 1991.
Adia said intense competition to preserve market share had depressed
margins, despite measures to cut costs and reduce staff.
Mr Nico Issenmann, Adia's chief executive, said turnover in the first
quarter of 1992 was 5 per cent higher than a year earlier, but added that he
expected another difficult year. Although the economic situation could well
improve in the US, he foresaw 'no marked pick-up' in Europe.
The company nevertheless expects at least to match last year's results in
1992.
Adia shifted direction last year to concentrate on its core personnel
business after Swiss businessman Klaus Jacobs and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus,
the German retailing group, took control of the group from Mr Werner Rey's
Omni Holding, which is in liquidation. The sell-off programme concerns
mainly security, inspection and computer leasing companies in Europe and the
US.
The divestment programme reduced the company's net debt by SFr300m to about
SFr1.3bn.
