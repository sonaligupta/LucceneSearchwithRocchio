FT  16 MAR 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


The effects of Thatcherite reforms on the NHS are beginning to surface, like
the oil-smeared detritus from a depth-charged submarine. BBC1's new tabloid
current affairs magazine, Here And Now, promises us a top surgeon who has
gone undercover to expose the goings-on at NHS HQ in Leeds (7.30).
Dispatches shows how fewer patients are referred to specialists, and how
teams of experts are being disbanded as a result (9.00 C4).
Not before time BBC2 screens a programme questioning the modern tendency to
put children on pedestals and give them everything they want: Spoiling The
Child? Goodness knows what the question mark is for. As with the 'What
ghouls]' reaction of ghoulish newspaper reports from Gloucester, there is
some irony here: television is a major contributor to the transformation of
children into tin gods (8.10 BBC2).
BBC2's filmed drama slot, 'Screen Two', offers a story called All Things
Bright And Beautiful about a 10-year-old Irish altar boy who, in 1954,
starts to see visions of the Virgin Mary (9.00).
