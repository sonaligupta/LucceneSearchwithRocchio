FT  19 APR 94 / Problems found with 400 law firms


The Law Society, which set up a special investigations bureau last year as
part of its 'Operation Crackdown' on fraud, has identified nearly 400
'problem firms' of solicitors. It said 34 firms were under investigation and
19 problem firms had been investigated in detail.
Its monitoring unit, which visits firms to check they are complying with
solicitors' accounts rules, last year found that more than 300 firms were
either 'unstable' or 'inherently unstable'.
In the 120-plus unstable firms compliance was judged to be particularly poor
or there was severe financial difficulty to the extent that clients' money
was considered at risk. Inherently unstable firms have unsatisfactory
compliance systems but no immediate risk to client money.
