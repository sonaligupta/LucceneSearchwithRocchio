FT  13 NOV 92 / Letter: Proclaiming devotion, but not bothering to read


   From Mr EDWARD CRAWFORD


Sir, The apparent approval of the government for the construction of the
Jubilee Line extension reminded me of Adam Smith's wise words: 'The proud
minister of an ostentatious court may frequently take pleasure in executing
a work of splendour and magnificence such as a great highway. . .But to
execute a great number of little works (that) have little to recommend them
but their extreme utility, is a business which appears too mean and paltry
to merit the attention of so great a magistrate. Such works are almost
always entirely neglected.' (An Enquiry into the Nature and Causes of the
Wealth of Nations, Book V Chapter I, Everyman edition p217).
Meanwhile the excellent comprehensive school (listed by you last week) where
my wife works is falling down and in urgent need of rebuilding while the
wretched Conservative council is at its wits' end for money.
It seems such a pity that, as with the poll tax fiasco, those shallow
politicians who proclaim their devotion to the master do not actually bother
to read his works.
Edward Crawford,
