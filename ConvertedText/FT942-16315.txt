FT  11 APR 94 / International Company News: Crackdown on spread of futures
in China


   By TONY WALKER

China has cracked down on the proliferation of futures markets and traders,
placing a ban on the establishment of new markets and requiring brokers to
re-register with the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The State Council (cabinet) order tightening controls over fledgling futures
markets reflects growing official alarm at the spread of poorly regulated
exchanges and risks of substantial losses for inexperienced traders.
Mr Zhu Li, a spokesman for the CSRC, the industry watchdog, warned that
'rushed experiments could incur economic losses and even result in social
unrest'.
Some 30 futures markets and wholesale trading centres have sprung up in
China in the past year or so, including commodities' futures exchanges for
metals, cereals and petroleum located in Shanghai.
Representatives of the larger exchanges have been calling for national
regulation to govern futures markets, but these have been slow to appear.
Mr Zhu said some 500 futures trading corporations have emerged in China in
the past two years of which about 200 are unregistered.
The CSRC has been asked to 'closely review' all futures markets and report
to the State Council on its findings. Those given approval will be obliged
to re-register with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce.
All futures brokers, including Sino-foreign joint ventures, of which there
are about 50, will also be obliged to re-register with the CSRC.
The State Council directive also made clear that stricter controls would be
placed on state-owned enterprises engaging in futures trading. Law
enforcement agencies would be banned from speculating in the futures
markets.
The authorities have banned the use of bank credits in futures trading.
Trading in currency futures without permission has also been banned.
