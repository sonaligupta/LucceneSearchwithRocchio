FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ferrum expands as losses fall


   By TIM BURT


Ferrum Holdings, the lossmaking engineering group, yesterday said it was
acquiring Chalcon Group, a Midlands plating business, as part of a
wide-ranging restructuring and expansion plan.
The company is funding the all-paper transaction by issuing 7.55m shares
worth Pounds 3.4m, and has invited Mr Mike Akers, chairman of Chalcon, to
take over as chief executive of the enlarged group.
It is also raising Pounds 5m via a rights issue involving 11.1m new shares
at 45p each, which after consolidation would be offered to shareholders on a
1-for-5 basis.
Mr Garry Frier, Ferrum's current chief executive, has agreed to stand down
and is expected to receive Pounds 150,000 compensation. He leaves behind him
a company which cut its 1993 losses from Pounds 3.64m to Pounds 2.8m on
reduced turnover of Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 38.5m).
Losses per share came out at 8.22p (12.24p).
Mr Simon Miller, chairman, said: 'The future of the enlarged group will be
increasingly directed towards quality engineering businesses in niche
markets.'
