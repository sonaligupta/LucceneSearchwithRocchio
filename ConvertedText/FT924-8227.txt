FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Recovery under way at Bett Bros


   By GRAHAM DELLER


BETT BROTHERS, the property, building and leisure group, returned to the
black with profits of Pounds 3.3m pre-tax in the second half of its year to
August 31, writes Graham Deller.
The profit, which partly reflected lower interest charges of Pounds 2.49m
(Pounds 3.17m) following restructuring of the balance sheet, reduced the
deficit for the full year from Pounds 8.85m to Pounds 4.21m, struck after an
exceptional charge of Pounds 7.51m (Pounds 15.6m).
Group turnover fell to Pounds 23m (Pounds 30.9m). Losses per 20p share
worked through at 19.17p (57.35p). The final dividend, like the interim, is
passed; a total of 4.2p was paid in the previous year.
