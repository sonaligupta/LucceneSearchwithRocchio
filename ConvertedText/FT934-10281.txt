FT  06 NOV 93 / Spanish executives jailed

   MADRID


A Barcelona judge investigating corporate tax evasion in Spain yesterday
ordered the imprisonment of senior executives of a leading insurance group
pending charges linked to false invoicing in order to reduce profit figures
and the creation of funds of 'black' money beyond the reach of the fiscal
authorities, Tom Burns reports from Madrid.
The judge refused bail for the chairman and the managing director of La
Estrella and for the chief executive of Grupo Vitalicio, two big insurance
firms owned by a holding company controlled by Banco Central Hispano,
Spain's biggest commercial bank. Five other businessmen were arrested, two
of whom were allegedly involved in recent real estate operations in
Barcelona.
The detention orders appeared to be a breakthrough in a series of
painstaking inquiries over the alleged wide use of fictitious receipts in
Spanish business circles. Judicial officials say the Barcelona court is
examining the accounts of 350 companies and that the total amount of tax
allegedly evaded in this particular fraud case could total some Pta10bn
(Pounds 50m).
