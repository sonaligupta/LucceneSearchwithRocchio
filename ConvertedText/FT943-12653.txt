FT  23 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Blue chip weakness
affects Nikkei


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


Tokyo
Selling of blue chip shares by corporate and overseas investors pushed
prices lower, and the Nikkei index lost ground in spite of buying by
individual investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index fell 160.03 to 20,462.89 after a high of 20,673.53 in
early trading and a low of 20,427.29 in the afternoon. The index fell 1.5
per cent on the week.
The slight rebound of the dollar against the yen helped share prices in the
morning, but afternoon profit-taking and arbitrage selling depressed the
index.
Volume totaled 278m shares against 257m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 14.12 to 1,637.86 while the Nikkei 300 lost 3.02, or 1
per cent to 296.53. Losers led gainers by 741 to 250, with 186 issues
remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.24 to 1,325.97.
High-technology issues which have gained on the multi-media and
telecommunications themes fell. NEC fell Y10 to Y1,200 and Fujitsu declined
Y20 to Y1,050 while heavy electricals such as Hitachi lost Y10 to Y1,000.
Profit-taking hit large capital steels and shipbuilders. Nippon Steel fell
Y1 to Y339 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries declined Y9 to Y784.
Speculative issues were picked up by individual investors. Tomoegawa Paper,
which rose by its daily limit, climbed Y69 to Y635 and Kiyo Bank rose Y7 to
Y941 on rumours that a speculator was buying up the bank's shares.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 165.20 to 22,919.88 in volume of 33.2m
shares.
Roundup
Taipei lost most of its gains, Manila was strong and other markets drifted.
TAIPEI encountered heavy selling following Thursday's impressive rise. The
weighted index slid 81.10 to 6,496.60 as turnover rose to TDollars 126.17bn
from Thursday's TDollars 91.53bn. The market gained 1.4 per cent over the
week.
Financial sector stocks took the biggest losses: ICBC down TDollars 4.50 to
TDollars 88.50 and China Trust down TDollars 4 to TDollars 79. Plastics also
fell heavily: Taiwan Polypropylene, Grand Petrochemical and USI Far East all
falling by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 68.50, TDollars 52 and
TDollars 47.50, respectively.
MANILA recorded its biggest one day rise in seven weeks assisted by strong
demand for Petron's initial public offering.
The composite index closed up 59.46 at 2,708.00, for a week's rise of nearly
4 per cent. Turnover advanced strongly to 1.44bn pesos.
HONG KONG was pushed higher by a round of late bargain hunting. The Hang
Seng index advanced 35.33 to 9,152.99, up 0.4 per cent over the week.
Turnover was HKDollars 2.55bn from Thursday's HKDollars 3.35bn.
Brokers noted that short-term positions had been taken on selected blue
chips such as Jardine Matheson, up HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 62.75. There was
also interest in defensive sectors such as utilities, with its sub-index
outperforming the overall market, rising 0.8 per cent to 10,552. HK Electric
rose 45 cents to HKDollars 23.45 and HK Telecom added 15 cents to HKDollars
15.
The banking sector was the only loser as investors remained unnerved by
worse than expected interim results from Bank of East Asia, which slid 60
cents to HKDollars 31.70.
SYDNEY rose slightly in subdued trade, and the All Ordinaries index put on
3.3 to 2,052.6, barely changed over the week.
Turnover was ADollars 368.7m.
Independent Holdings added 41 cents to ADollars 4.81 after Davids lifted its
takeover offer for the grocer by 55 cents to ADollars 4.80. IHL recommended
shareholders to accept the new bid.
Foodland, which holds an 18 per cent stake in Independent, fell 5 cents to
ADollars 4.85.
Meanwhile, Coles Myer and Rank Commercial said that they would drop their
bid for Foodland if their application for leave to appeal an injunction
stalling the offer failed
Coles Myer lost 1 cent to ADollars 4.29.
SEOUL rebounded from recent weakness and the composite index added 3.74 to
939.09, off 1 per cent across the week.
