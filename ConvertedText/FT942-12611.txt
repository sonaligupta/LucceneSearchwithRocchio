FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rice futures contract set to
join Chicago's big boys

The world's only rice futures contract is about to come of age.
The Chicago Board of Trade, which trades futures and options on maize,
wheat, soyabeans and other agricultural and financial commodities, plans to
adopt as its own the rough rice futures contract now traded on its tiny
subsidiary, the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.
The CBoT wants to shift the contract, which trades in units of 200,000
pounds of No. 2 or better long grain, rough rice, deliverable in 12 counties
in eastern Arkansas, under its own banner because of a recent surge in world
rice trading.
Production shortfalls in 1992 and 1993 have resulted in Japan purchasing
significant amounts of rice on the world market for the first time since
1984.
'The CBoT believes the rice contract is destined to grow as more and more
countries open up their markets to free trade. The CBoT can provide greater
visibility and a broad range of opportunities for the rice contract,' said
Mr. Patrick Arbor, CBoT chairman.
Rice futures were launched in 1981 at the now-defunct New Orleans Commodity
Exchange. After three years of listless trading, the contract shifted to
Chicago, and came under the jurisdiction of the MidAmerica Exchange. Still
lightly traded, 7,621 rice futures contracts changed hands at the MidAm
during March.
US rice production has averaged about 8m tonnes a year since 1990, with long
grain rice representing about 70 per cent of that total. According to CBoT
statistics, about 50 per cent of US long grain rice is grown in Arkansas,
the deliverable area for the futures contract.
Although the US accounts for only 1 to 2 per cent of world rice production,
it exports about 40 per cent of its crop, making it the second leading rice
exporter in the world after Thailand. In 1993 the US exported 2.7m tonnes of
rice out of total world exports of 16m tonnes.
