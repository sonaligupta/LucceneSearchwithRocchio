FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach Pounds 8.36m acquisition


Stagecoach Holdings, the bus and coach operator, is acquiring Cleveland
Transit and the rest of Kingston Upon Hull Transport, which provides bus
services in Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees and Hull, in a Pounds 8.36m
deal.
Undertakings to accept the agreed offer have been received in respect of 51
per cent of the shares in Cleveland, which holds 51 per cent of Kingston
Transport.
The 359-for-200 offer values Cleveland at Pounds 7.7m and could involve the
issue of 3.59m shares. There are 385p-a-share cash and loan note
alternatives.
The 305,970 share offer for the outstanding stake in Kingston Transport is
worth Pounds 656,000.
In the year to March 26 Cleveland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 950,000
on turnover of Pounds 11.4m. Net assets at the period-end were Pounds
117,000 after writing off goodwill of about Pounds 1.2m.
The results included Kingston from December 10 in which time it had pre-tax
profits of Pounds 50,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.
Stagecoach said that Cleveland already had operating margins of 10 per cent.
Nonetheless, improved profits could be achieved with further investment in
new vehicles and economies of scale from the enlarged group.
