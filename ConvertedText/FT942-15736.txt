FT  14 APR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore offer to host WTO meeting


Singapore has offered to host the first ministerial meeting of the new World
Trade Organisation, due to be held in 1996.
The offer was made yesterday in Marrakesh by the trade and industry
minister, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong. Mr Yeo said the choice of Singapore would be a
recognition of Asia's contribution to global trade. It would complete the
circle of Uruguay Round meetings that began with the round's launch in
Uruguay in 1986.
