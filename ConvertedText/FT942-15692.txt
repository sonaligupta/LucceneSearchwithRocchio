FT  14 APR 94 / Right urges fresh DSS cuts


   By JAMES BLITZ


Rightwing Conservative MPs are renewing pressure on the Department of Social
Security to cut spending, claiming moves to contain expenditure on state
benefits have not gone far enough.
In a policy paper Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, MP for Chingford, calls for an end
to universal state benefits and a new drive on private pension provision.
The paper, Social Security - Time for a Revolution, follows a similar paper
from the Adam Smith Institute in February, and reflects Tory rightwingers'
growing concern that the government is backing down on its commitment to cut
public expenditure.
Mr Duncan Smith,a member of the No Turning Back Group of neo-Thatcherite
Tories, said yesterday: 'There is an assumption that we have been cutting
social services for years. But the reality is that we are actually
increasing spending.'
The government has introduced greater targeting of benefits for invalids and
the unemployed and abolished the statutory sick pay subsidy for large
employers. However, the DSS budget is still projected to increase between
1994 and 1997.
The pamphlet calls for a single income-assessed benefit, to replace the many
benefits currently available.
It also calls for the abolition of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme
(Serps) and reform of National Insurance Contributions.
