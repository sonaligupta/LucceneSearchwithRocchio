FT  18 APR 94 / Company News (This Week): Roche - Other Companies


Shares of most leading pharmaceutical groups have sagged in the past year
under pressure from governments for lower drug prices, but those of the
Swiss group have sailed briskly upwards. Tomorrow investors will learn if
their bet has been a wise one as Roche, now the world's most highly valued
pharmaceuticals groups, reveals its 1993 figures. Net income is expected to
be at least 25 per cent higher than 1992's SFr1.9bn. (Dollars 1.3bn).
