   PARIS


La Tribune de L'Expansion, one of France's leading financial newspapers, is
expected to be sold within the next ten days, Alice Rawsthorn writes in
Paris. The Expansion group, which owns La Tribune, yesterday told the
newspaper's staff that it was in negotiations with two prospective
purchasers for the financially troubled paper. La Tribune, like the rest of
the French financial press, has suffered from the slowdown in the French
economy.
