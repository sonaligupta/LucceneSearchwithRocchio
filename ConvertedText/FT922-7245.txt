FT  20 MAY 92 / Survey of World Banking (1): Danger at the frontier - In the
1980s, internationalisation led bankers from different countries to make
identical mistakes in lending. As national barriers continue to fall,
recession has forced most to cut lending as they reorganise, again in
similar ways, to raise profits by reducing costs. But have they learned from
their mistakes?


   By ROBERT PESTON


THE internationalisation of financial markets has for two decades been
viewed by bankers as presenting great opportunities for profitable
expansion. But right now bankers and bank regulators are concentrating
rather more on the pitfalls of bringing down barriers to doing business
across national frontiers.
of the past year are illustrations of such pitfalls. First there was the
closure, last summer, of the Bank for Credit and Commerce International,
which has caused huge losses for thousands of depositors.
Here was a bank mistrusted by the financial community that was nonetheless
permitted to continue trading fraudulently for years. Much of the blame for
this lies squarely with the international system for regulating banks.
BCCI cleverly put its domicile in a different country from those in which it
carried out the bulk of its business. The supervisor in its home country,
Luxembourg, did not have the resources to monitor properly its vast
international operations.
So BCCI continued to take deposits long after it should have been closed
down, had it been properly supervised. Thus the bank regulators of the
leading industrial countries, grouped in the Basle Committee for Banking
Supervision, are trying to come up with tough new rules, which would prevent
any bank from operating in the major industrial economies unless it subjects
its worldwide operations to proper scrutiny by regulators, among which one
regulator would play a leading role.
The second big event has been the attempt by Olympia & York, the world's
biggest property developer, to restructure its Dollars 12bn of borrowings.
O&Y was in theory the text-book case of a company reducing the risks of its
business by expanding across borders. If the inherent riskiness of the
business had been reduced, the risk of lending to it should also have been
reduced.
O&Y's 100 banks each have a different tale of woe concerning how they
misunderstood the risks of lending to it. One example will suffice to show
how the internationalisation of a business can provide false comfort.
In November 1990, after months of trying, O&Y succeeded in persuading a club
of 10 banks to provide it with Pounds 490m to finance the construction of
the Canary Wharf office development in London's docklands.
The banks had profound reservations about the Pounds 3bn project. They were
concerned that the sheer scale of the development was excessive. They were
convinced that the London property market was past its peak. They were
concerned that transport links between Canary Wharf and central London were
poor.
Yet they provided the money, because they obtained a guarantee from the
parent company in Canada. If Canary Wharf failed, the mighty O&Y would bail
them out - at least, that is what they believed.
But the banks, like O&Y itself, neglected one simple but crucial factor.
Some of the causes of the decline in UK property prices were not unique to
the UK alone. Recession was taking its toll not just of the London real
estate market but also of those in Toronto and New York.
Internationalisation - the linkages between the economies in North America
and Europe, and also between markets in the respective continents - had by
no means mitigated the risks of lending to O&Y.
Another example of internationalisation bringing problems is the effect on
financial markets everywhere of Japanese banks' relative shortage of
capital. This is also an example of the costs incurred when bank regulators
try to create a level playing field between banks operating in international
markets.
By the end of this year, banks from all countries which are signatories to
the 1983 Basle Concordat, are supposed to carry in their balance sheets an
identical minimum amount of capital relative to their assets, known as a
capital ratio. Banks are required to maintain these minimum capital ratios
as a protection to their depositors.
However, many of the big Japanese banks have less than the required amount
of capital. In part, this is because the Bank of Japan, the Japanese
regulator, had for years set its banks different standards from those set by
regulators in other countries.
The other big problem for the Japanese banks is that a substantial
proportion of their capital is in the form of shares listed on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, and these have fallen sharply in value as the stock market
has fallen.
This shortage of capital for the Japanese banks is not a little local
difficulty, because in the 1980s the Japanese banks were the biggest lenders
in international markets.
In order to try to meet the new capital requirement, the Japanese banks are
both trying to raise new capital - and this is proving difficult - and
calling in foreign loans and refusing to make new ones.
There is one positive effect for other banks. Without competition for loans
from the Japanese, the margin on international lending has widened.
But there is also a powerful negative effect. A shortage of liquidity from
Japanese banks is causing difficulties for some big borrowers. The UK's
Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel and one of the world's biggest
borrowers with Pounds 8bn of banking facilities, is one potential sufferer.
It has breached its borrowing covenants, and therefore needs to get the
agreement of its banks to make drawings on its unused facilities. The
company freely admits that it expects difficulties in obtaining this
agreement from its Japanese banks - though it hopes that enough will give
the waiver to the relevant banking covenant to allow the project to
continue.
There is another aspect to the internationalisation of banking which is
proving more salutary, and that is the spur provided by international
competition to cost-cutting in the banking industry.
Though the competitive pressure from Japanese banks in lending to big
companies has reduced, most banking markets remain relatively competitive,
and cross-border competition is a factor in this. There is also a widespread
expectation that further barriers to cross-border banking will come down -
whether the borders are state ones in the US or national ones in the
European Community.
It is no accident, therefore, that banks in many different parts of the
world are reorganising their operations in broadly similar ways.
The thrust of the strategic moves which many of them are making is to

It is no accident, therefore, that banks in many different parts of the
world are reorganising their operations in broadly similar ways.
The thrust of the strategic moves which many of them are making is to
increase productivity by reducing costs. In the US, there has been a wave of
mergers and takeovers. In simplistic terms, the aim of the merger of
Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover in New York - and of the takeover of
Security Pacific by Bank of America, in California - is to feed the revenues
of two banks through the cost structure of just one. Lloyds Bank's attempt
to buy Midland in the UK has similar aims.
In all these cases, the merger or takeover has foreshadowed enormous cuts in
the workforce of the combined banks to reduce costs. Banks in many countries
are more vulnerable to takeover than they have ever been, due to legislative
and regulatory changes. But even banks choosing not to combine with others
are shedding vast numbers of employees and endeavouring to become more
productive.
All of which is good news for bank shareholders, who over the years have had
reason to fear that banks' executives put too low an emphasis on earning a
respectable return on capital. But if shareholders had one wish, it would be
that the managers of their banks could become better judges of the risks
inherent in different forms of lending.
Internationalisation in the 1980s often seemed to mean that bankers from
different countries made identical mistakes in lending to highly borrowed
companies and to property businesses.
Recession has forced most banks to reduce lending, so it is too early to say
whether bankers have learned from their mistakes and have become better
evaluators of risks. If there were a widespread improvement in bankers'
basic lending skills, 'internationalisation' would no longer be a dirty
word.
