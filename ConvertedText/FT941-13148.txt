FT  27 JAN 94 / Budget is forecast to cut deficit to Dollars 180bn

Next year's budget deficit will be less than Dollars 180bn (Pounds 120bn),
President Bill Clinton predicted in his State of the Union address, 40 per
cent lower than the Dollars 300bn many analysts were forecasting when he
assumed office last year.
The president said the budget for fiscal 1995, which begins in October,
would be 'one of the toughest budgets presented to Congress'. More than 300
programmes would be cut and 100 eliminated.
The full budget details will not be available until early next month. In
addition to tax rises and spending restraint enacted last year, the rapid
decline in the deficit appears to reflect a combination of factors. These
include an unexpectedly sharp deceleration in healthcare inflation, a strong
cyclical recovery which is boosting tax receipts, and lower than projected
long-term interest rates which are reducing debt service costs.
Medical care prices rose at an annual rate of 4.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of last year. For 1993 as a whole, the increase was 5.4 per cent,
twice the overall rate of inflation but sharply down from 9.6 per cent as
recently as 1990. Last year's healthcare inflation was the lowest since
1973.
Partly as a result of slowing healthcare inflation, officials have reduced
projected spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the public programmes for the
elderly and poor, by about Dollars 45bn over the next five years.
The key factor reducing the deficit in the short term was the strong
cyclical economic recovery, according to Salomon Brothers. Growth was
boosting tax receipts, especially from the corporate sector, and cutting
increases in transfer payments, for example on food stamps and unemployment
insurance.
A deficit of Dollars 180bn or less in fiscal 1995 compares with last year's
White House projection of a Dollars 296bn deficit, if no action were taken,
or Dollars 200bn after enactment of last year's budget. But it would
represent an extension of a well-established trend. The deficit peaked at
Dollars 290bn in fiscal 1992 - less than the feared Dollars 350bn - and fell
to Dollars 255bn in fiscal 1993.
Private sector analysts are projecting a deficit of Dollars 220bn-Dollars
240bn in fiscal 1994, against official projections last year of Dollars
262bn. Next month's budget is expected to show the deficit falling to well
under 2 per cent of GDP in the next five years.
But any permanent improvement would depend mainly on the durability of the
slowdown in healthcare spending. That, in turn, will depend on the nature of
reforms enacted this year.
