FT  30 APR 94 / International Company News: Aetna Life earnings slide after
catastrophe claims


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Aetna Life & Casualty yesterday reported a big decline in first-quarter
operating earnings to Dollars 53m in the wake of a big increase in
catastrophe costs related to the California earthquake and winter storms. A
year ago, the US insurer recorded operating earnings of Dollars 117m.
Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 46m, or 40 cents a share. A
year ago, net income was Dollars 394m, or 3.57 cents, following one-off
benefits of Dollars 255m from accounting changes and gains from discontinued
operations.
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said the improvement in the company's
underlying businesses was overshadowed by extraordinary catastrophe costs of
Dollars 124m, up from just Dollars 31m at the same stage of 1993. The
earnings of almost every large US insurer were undermined in the quarter by
a big jump in claims from customers affected by the California earthquake
and severe winter storms.
Aside from its commercial and personal property/casualty operations, the
rest of Aetna's businesses reported higher earnings for the quarter,
including health and life insurance, financial services, and international.
Aetna's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 52 before the close on the New
York Stock Exchange.
