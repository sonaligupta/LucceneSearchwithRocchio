FT  28 SEP 94 / Biotech market growing


   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor


The European market for goods that depend directly on the application of
biotechnology is worth Pounds 30bn a year in sectors ranging from
pharmaceuticals and animal health to chemicals and food, according to a
survey undertaken by Ernst & Young and funded by the biotech industry. It
estimates that 184,000 jobs depend on biotechnology. However, the study
found that companies plan to move future investment away from Europe. The US
is the favoured location for the future, while Japan and other Asian
countries are becoming popular. Companies' reasons for preferring the US
include greater public support for biotech investment, a more predictable
science-based regulatory structure and better access to skilled staff than
in Europe.
