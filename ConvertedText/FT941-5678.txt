FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Cemex to take control of
Venezuela producer


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex), the big Mexican cement company, has agreed to
purchase a controlling stake in Corporacion Venezolana de Cementos
(Vencemos), Venezuela's largest cement producer for about Dollars 300m.
Cemex said a price, and the number of shares it would buy, had not been
fixed. However, it is widely expected that Cemex will pay about Dollars 300m
for its stake.
Vencemos has a stock market value of Dollars 510m. Cemex is expected to pay
a premium for control.
Vencemos has 50 per cent of the Venezuelan cement market, and 30 per cent of
the concrete market. Last year, it sold 2.8m tonnes of cement and exported
another 1m tonnes.
Mr Eugenio Mendoza, the head of Grupo Mendoza, said the alliance with Cemex
would help increase domestic sales and sales to the Caribbean.
The purchase marks a further step in global expansion for the Mexican cement
company, which is the fourth-largest in the world. Cemex, already the
dominant producer in Mexico, has operations in the US and, through its
Dollars 1.85bn purchase of Valenciana and Sanson in 1992, is the largest
producer in Spain.
Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive of Cemex, said the purchase was
consistent with the company's strategy of 'acquiring important stakes in
companies that operate and have a leadership position in developing
countries with strong perspectives of growth in the demand of cement and
concrete'.
Mr Zambrano said Cemex would focus on expansion in Latin America in the
short and medium-term, and Asia in the medium and long-term.
The purchase will increase Cemex's overall cement capacity to about 40m
tonnes. It said its control of Vencemos would enable the company to reduce
costs and improve profit margins.
