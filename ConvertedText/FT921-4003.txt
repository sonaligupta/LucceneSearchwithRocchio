FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Government Statements): Relief to be made easier
prior to abolition - Business Expansion Scheme


IT IS proposed:
that the termination of Business Expansion Scheme tax relief for private
rented housing at the end of December 1993 should be confirmed;
that the remainder of the scheme for trading companies should come to an end
at the same time;
that the BES rules should be amended to make it easier for companies to use
the BES for mortgage rescue schemes;
that a further minor amendment should be made to make it easier for
companies to use the BES while having a property management subsidiary;
that the mortgage rescue change should take effect from yesterday; while
that for property management companies should be backdated to the beginning
of the scheme.
Tax relief is available under the BES for investment in unquoted trading
companies and companies providing private rented housing.
The relief for private rented housing runs only until the end of December
1993. The chancellor proposes that the relief for unquoted trading companies
should also end then, thus terminating the whole BES relief at the end of
1993.
Mortgage rescue schemes
A property is currently excluded from the BES where the BES company entered
into arrangements for letting it before acquisition, where it is let at any
time on the day the company acquires it, or other than on a qualifying
tenancy after the company acquires it.
These conditions make it difficult to arrange mortgage rescues which qualify
for BES relief since owner-occupiers generally want to know they can stay on
as tenants before agreeing to sell their homes.
The conditions will be relaxed in cases where a BES company acquires a
property from an owner-occupier and grants a qualifying tenancy of that
property to the former owner (in all such cases, and not just those
involving mortgage rescue schemes) This will make it easier to operate
mortgage rescue schemes without jeopardising BES tax relief.
Property management companies
A minor amendment to the BES rules will be made so that, subject to certain
conditions, the existence of a property management subsidiary will not
prevent a BES company from coming within the scope of the relief.
