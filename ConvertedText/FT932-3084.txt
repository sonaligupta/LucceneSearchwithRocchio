FT  16 JUN 93 / Extra Pounds 6.4bn sought for Tube


   By RICHARD TOMKINS


LONDON'S heavily subsidised Underground railway could become self-sufficient
financially if the government invested an extra Pounds 6.4bn over the next
10 years, the network claimed yesterday, Richard Tomkins writes.
London Underground said the extra money, which would more than double
government investment in the network, was needed to bring the railway up to
date after decades of comparative neglect.
The network said about Pounds 8.5bn was needed over 10 years to deliver the
'decently modern metro' that London deserved. Part of this could be financed
through efficiency gains and higher fares.
It said the government would recoup the remaining Pounds 6.4bn through extra
tax revenues and reduced unemployment benefits resulting from the jobs
generated by the railway.
