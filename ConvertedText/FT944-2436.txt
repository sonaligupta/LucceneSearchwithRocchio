FT  16 DEC 94 / Mercury to end Enfield campaign


Mercury, the telecommunications company, is to end its television
advertising campaign which features comedian Harry Enfield, it said
yesterday.
The comic has played the part of stuffy Mr Grayson, alongside his friend Mr
Cholmondley-Warner, for 2 1/2 years in the parody of old black and white
newsreel films. During this time the company has gained more than 1m
customers.
The change follows the shake-up announced 10 days ago in which 2,500 staff
will lose their jobs - more than a quarter of the workforce. Mercury plans
to concentrate on business users and is to abandon its public payphone
operation.
The award-winning campaign broke new ground in advertising techniques. The
company said: 'It's been a really brilliant campaign for us but it's no
longer really relevant.'
Last year the company spent Pounds 12m on advertising.
