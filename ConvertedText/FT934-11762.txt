FT  29 OCT 93 / UK Company News: ICI Australia up after restructure

ICI AUSTRALIA, the chemical group controlled by Imperial Chemical
Industries, announced increased profits and dividends after a year of
restructuring.
The company lifted net profits by 39 per cent, from ADollars 85.4m to
ADollars 118.9m (Pounds 50.5m), in the year to September on turnover ahead
from ADollars 2.77bn to ADollars 2.83bn. The annual dividend goes up from 18
cents to 23 cents.
Directors said the result came against a background of low economic activity
in the company's main markets. 'The improved profitability reflects the
ongoing benefits of restructuring and of increased productivity,' they said.
'Trading conditions in 1994 are likely to be similar to those of the past
year, with most markets reflecting continued modest recovery. Improvement in
prices for some key products, notably plastics, depends on recovery in
international markets.'
The plastics division reduced its pre-tax loss from ADollars 35m to ADollars
24m, with chemicals operations lifting their contribution from ADollars 73m
to ADollars 90m, but fertilisers easing from ADollars 34m to ADollars 32m.
The consumer products division increased profits from ADollars 124m to
ADollars 139m. The overall result was after tax of ADollars 65.6m (ADollars
53.9m). Depreciation took ADollars 117.9m (ADollars 126.6m) and net interest
payable was down from ADollars 40.9m to ADollars 36.9m.
