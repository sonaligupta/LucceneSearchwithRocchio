FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Losses at Eadie grow to Pounds 0.5m


Losses at Eadie Holdings, the USM-quoted company with interests in
specialist engineering and textile machinery, continued to accrue through
the second six months and for the full 1990 year totalled Pounds 502,000
pre-tax.
The swing, from previous profits of Pounds 1.18m, reflected very poor
trading conditions in the transport and wire industries throughout the year.
Sales declined by 8 per cent to Pounds 23.32m, although exports showed an
improvement of 16 per cent. The interim dividend was passed and the final is
also being omitted - shareholders received a reduced total of 1.75p for
1989.
After tax, extraordinary items and dividend payments the retained loss
worked through at Pounds 84,000 (profits Pounds 239,000). Losses per share
amounted to 1.1p (earnings 2.66p).
