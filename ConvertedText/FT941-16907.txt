FT  07 JAN 94 / Royal Mail staff accept 1.5% offer


Royal Mail staff have voted by 4-1 in favour of accepting a
government-imposed pay rise of 1.5 per cent, the Union of Communication
Workers said yesterday. The 132,000 postal delivery and sorting office
workers are the last big group of public-sector staff to vote on the 1.5 per
cent, which the government set as a ceiling for millions of workers in the
1992-93 pay round.
