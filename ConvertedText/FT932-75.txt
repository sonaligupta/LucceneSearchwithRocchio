FT  30 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fl 150m loss forecast by Fokker


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


   AMSTERDAM


FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker in which Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of
Germany recently acquired a majority stake, expects to report a loss this
year of Fl 150m (Dollars 79m), compared with net profit of Fl 20m in 1992.
The company, which blamed the downturn on the malaise in the world aviation
market, said it expected an improvement in 1994 and future years, helped by
Dasa's involvement and by restructuring measures already being taken.
The predicted loss is due partly to the non-recurring cost of laying off
staff, as well as to higher interest charges caused by the burden of unsold
aircraft.
Fokker is lowering output and restructuring production of its Fokker 100
model so that final assembly takes place only when a delivery is about to be
made.
The warning of losses came after the close of trading in Amsterdam, where a
minority of Fokker's shares are still listed.
Fokker said debt levels would fall in the course of 1993. It added that its
financial position would be bolstered by the recapitalisation associated
with the sale of government-owned shares to Dasa, as well as the recent
issue of new shares to the German company, which is part of the Daimler-Benz
group.
