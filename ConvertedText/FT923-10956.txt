FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Ruffled feathers


Veteran cricket commentator Brian Johnston confessed to being stumped when
he discovered a radio station that seemed to be broadcasting nothing but
birdsong.
So during a lull in Sunday's Test Match special on Radio 3 he asked his
startled guest to throw some light on the mystery chorus.
The answer would hardly have provided a crumb of comfort; what Johnston had
stumbled across was the test transmissions for Classic FM - the national
classical music station to be launched in September and a deadly rival for
Radio 3.
