FT  21 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


Watch Television's Greatest Christmas Hits (8.00 BBC1) and you will be able
to pretend that you have done Christmas and can let the whole mawkish mess
(so far as television is concerned) pass you by. We are told that Philip
Schofield, heart throb of little girls all over Britain, will be showing
that familiar skit where Morecambe and Wise sang 'There Is Nothing Like A
Dame' with a chorus line of news readers, Stanley Baxter's drag version of
the Queen's speech, and much more. BBC2 has replaced its scheduled
'Bookmark' repeat with a 40 Minutes Special on famine relief in Somalia
(9.30) The night's best piece of work by a mile will be October,
Eisenstein's astounding 1928 film about the 1917 revolution. It is the
source of many of the pictures which today are fixed in our heads as
authentic images. Imagine the scene where the workers stormed the gates of
the Winter Palace and, though you may think you remember newsreel pictures,
what you probably remember is Eisenstein's staged footage. It has been
plundered repeatedly for 'documentary' films. This is still one of the
greatest virtuoso works of cinema (10.00 C4).
