FT  18 APR 94 / International Company News: Iberia in agreement with United
Airlines

Iberia, Spain's government-owned national airline, has announced a
preliminary, wide-ranging commercial agreement with United Airlines.
The accord is modelled on the recent undertaking between the US carrier and
Germany's Lufthansa to co-operate over flight routes, ticket sales and
promotion.
The Iberia agreement will give United Airlines an increased share of the
Latin American market, where American Airlines is the dominant US carrier.
The Spanish airline has built up a strong position in Latin America through
its shareholdings in Aerolineas Argentinas, which is 85 per cent owned by
Iberia, and in Chile's Ladeco and Venezuela's Viasa.
Iberia, which has sustained heavy losses in recent years, in part because of
its Latin American investments, is likely to seek a participation by United
Airlines in the Aerolineas shareholding.
Iberia said that it will also be downgrading its presence in Miami, where it
operates a hub for Central American connections, and turning over most its
business there to the US carrier.
The agreement will allow Iberia's transatlantic passengers access to the
United Airlines network in the US and extend reciprocal services to United
Airlines passengers travelling on to destinations in Southern Europe.
In this sense it complements the agreement with Lufthansa that is weighted
towards the German airline's network of routes in Northern and Eastern
Europe.
Full details of the Iberia-United Airlines pact, the first such
international agreement ever undertaken by the Spanish airline, are due to
be announced in June.
Iberia is, meanwhile, understood to be conducting negotiations over a
possible sharing of European routes with Lufthansa, United Airlines' other
European partner.
