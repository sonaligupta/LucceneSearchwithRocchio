FT  07 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: The unheeded signs at MG


   From Mr MARTIN E SIMONS


Sir, Your leader, 'When a system breaks down' (December 21), was a pertinent
comment on the grave debacle at Metallgesellschaft, the extent of whose
problems you outlined in your report, 'Metallgesellschaft reveals losses of
almost DM2bn' (January 6). More needs to be said, though, about the
foolhardiness of MG's enormous expansion since 1989 which does not seem to
have been fully appreciated.
This is illustrated by the disastrous acquisition and subsequent divestment
of Schiess at great cost. MG's sale of 12.5 per cent of Kolbenschmidt in
October 1993, whereby it turned an important partly-owned, geared and
loss-making subsidiary into an associate, was a clear indication of
developing problems. However, this was apparently not adequately heeded by
principal shareholders and investment analysts. And this was well before MG
was hit by problems in the US triggered by falling oil prices.
The extraordinary scale of acquisitions and divestments, accompanied by
uncovered dividend payments, would have stretched the most competent of
managements and was surely doomed to failure. Some deals should have been
vetoed by MG's bank shareholders, notwithstanding their loss of what were
presumably substantial investment banking fees.
