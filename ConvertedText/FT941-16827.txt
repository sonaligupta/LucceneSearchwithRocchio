FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: St Ives sells Talbot back to founder


   By PAUL TAYLOR


St Ives, the UK printing group, has sold Talbot Publishing Systems, its
small lossmaking newspaper systems and software development business which
was acquired in July 1990, back to Mr Andrew Clunies-Ross, its managing
director and founder.
Talbot's main product is an Apple computer-based electronic page make-up
system designed for newspapers, but which St Ives originally hoped would
also be bought by magazine publishers.
Mr Miles Emley, St Ives' chairman, said the decision to dispose of the
business, which he said had been sold for 'a fairly nominal sum,' mainly
reflected the difficult market conditions in the pre-press industry.
This had resulted in Talbot incurring operating losses of about Pounds
100,000 in the first five months of the current year.
In addition, he said that magazine publishers had generally acquired
off-the-shelf elect-ronic publishing software packages, rather than
customised systems developed by Talbot.
Mr Emley, who succeeded Mr Robert Gavron as St Ives chairman last year, said
the Talbot business reported a profit in its first full year of ownership,
but had since lost money. As a result, no performance-related payments, over
and above the Pounds 1.2m acquisition price, have been made.
The sale means that under the latest accounting rules, goodwill of Pounds 1m
which was written off at the time of acquisition will be reinstated and
written off as exceptional.
