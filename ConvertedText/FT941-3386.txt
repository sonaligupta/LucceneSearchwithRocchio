FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Poland's biscuit market crumbles to
McVitie's

   WARSAW


A large share of Poland's biscuit market yesterday fell to McVitie's, a
United Biscuits subsidiary, when the biscuit and snacks producer agreed to
pay Pounds 19.1m for 80 per cent of the San factory in Jaroslaw, the
country's last large biscuit plant still in state hands.
Last year Jacobs Suchard bought the Olza plant in Cieszyn, while Bahlsen, a
German snack producer, took control of Skawina, another biscuit producer in
southern Poland.
These purchases came as PepsiCo Foods International was developing its
bourse-listed Wedel chocolate factory, bought in 1991, into a salty snacks
producer which looks set to double its 1993 net profit of 330bn zlotys
(Pounds 9.7m) this year.
Both RJR Nabisco and PepsiCo bid for San, which reported a Pounds 1.8m net
profit last year, as did the French BSN food group which has yet to purchase
a snacks plant in Poland.
Mr Hartwig Conzelmann, of McVitie's said yesterday that his company was
planning to build on San's 20 per cent market share and 'dominate the
country through a new nationwide marketing net work'.
Yesterday's agreement also spoke of plans for expansion from San's base in
south east Poland into Belarus and the Ukraine and the company is
considering building a salty snacks plant.
McVitie's intends raising San's capital by Pounds 6.7m this year and
investing a further Pounds 8.4m over the next two years. It will be
preparing a prospectus for a Warsaw stock market listing within nine months
and the Pounds 6.7m capital increase could well come from the local capital
market. McVitie's has promised to retain a 51 per cent in San for three
years.
The Central European Trust advised the Polish government on the transaction
while McVitie's was advised by Schroders.
McVitie's bought Gyori Keksz, Hungary's largest biscuit company in 1991.
