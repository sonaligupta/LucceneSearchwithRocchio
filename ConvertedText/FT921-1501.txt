FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: 'More efficient' Bupa swings from Pounds
38m deficit to surplus


   By MAGGIE URRY


A SHARP rise in subscription rates and tighter cost control helped Bupa, the
private health insurance and services group, return to the black in 1991.
Group revenue exceeded Pounds 1bn for the first time and the taxable result
swung from a deficit of Pounds 38.2m to a Pounds 1.3m surplus.
Bupa is a provident institution but new management was installed last year
with the aim of injecting a more commercial approach.
Mr Peter Jacobs, the chief executive who arrived last May, said that, given
the trading environment, the result showed a 'pretty dramatic turnaround'.
When he joined he decided that Bupa needed 'to operate on a more efficient
and competitive basis'. There had been 20 new entrants to the health
insurance market, he said, such as composite insurance groups.
Mr Jacobs felt that if a Labour government was elected and removed tax
relief for health insurance for pensioners, it would not have much effect on
Bupa's business. He said that the limited resources available for
healthcare, both state and private, could only be optimised if the two
sectors co-operated.
On the insurance side, Bupa increased premiums by an average of 20 per cent
and a similar rise was expected in the current year. The number of
subscribers fell by a net 6 per cent, although Mr Jacobs said it was hard to
say whether this represented a loss of market share, which is just under
half in the UK.
Subscriptions increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 819m, but benefits were up
by a lesser 15 per cent to Pounds 717.4m. At the same time, Bupa took a
tougher line on costs, which rose by 9.3 per cent to Pounds 142.3m. Net
investment income was up from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 21m, thanks to stronger
cash flow and lower interest payments on the purchase consideration for
Sanitas, the Spanish business acquired in 1989. This left the deficit before
tax from insurance activities down from Pounds 53.6m to Pounds 19.7m.
Within this total the Spanish business, which Mr Edward Lea, finance
director, said had operated an uncommercial pricing policy when acquired,
produced a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 7m (deficit Pounds 1.7m). Bupa has
renegotiated the purchase price of Sanitas after the final acquisition
audit.
The health services surplus rose 36 per cent to Pounds 21m, with income up
almost 12 per cent to Pounds 201.3m and costs up 9 per cent to Pounds
180.3m.
Bupa only pays tax on its investment income and health services activities,
and the Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 4m) charge left it requiring a Pounds 11.2m
(Pounds 42.2m) transfer from reserves. Thses, however, were increased during
the year from Pounds 239.7m to Pounds 311.8m, helped by a Pounds 40.6m
goodwill write-back after the renegotiation of the purchase price of
Sanitas, a Pounds 24.4m increase in the value of investments and a Pounds
12.3m surplus on revaluation of fixed assets.
