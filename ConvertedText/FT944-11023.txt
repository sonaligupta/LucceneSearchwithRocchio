FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Stratagem's rise to Pounds 2m helps shares


Shares of Stratagem Group yesterday jumped 7p to 174p after the revamped
manufacturing, distribution and services company turned in full-year pre-tax
profits of Pounds 2.12m.
The outcome, for the 12 months to August 31, compared with profits of Pounds
1.2m last time and was achieved on turnover ahead to Pounds 80.4m (Pounds
10.5m), reflecting the acquisition of Harrison Industries in August 1993.
'We said that we would turn round last year's acquisition and these figures
show that we deliver on our promises,' said Mr Bernard Kerrison, chairman.
The recommended final dividend is raised to 3.5p, making 5p (4.75p) for the
year, covered 2.5 times by earnings of 12.7p (9.5p) per share.
