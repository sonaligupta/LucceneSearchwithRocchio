FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: German backing for Portugal's
reform plan


   By PATRICK BLUM

GERMANY WILL support new Portuguese proposals aimed at breaking the impasse
over reform of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy, Mr Ignaz
Kiechle, German agriculture minister said in Lisbon yesterday.
Portugal currently holds the six-month rotating EC presidency and Mr Kiechle
held bilateral talks with Mr Arlindo Cunha, the Portuguese minister of
agriculture, over ways of speeding up agricultural reform.
'We wanted to study and seek jointly (with Portugal) the possibility of
common action at the European level. We want to do everything possible to
complete agricultural reform rapidly. Without doubt, these talks represented
progress. Our Portuguese partners have our full confidence and will have our
full support at the European level,' Mr Kiechle said.
The talks covered all the main aspects of agricultural reform put forward by
the European Commission, and were designed to prepare for the next meeting
of EC agriculture ministers at the end of this month. Many of the proposals
have met opposition from member states, particularly those dealing with
production controls for cereals and cattle, with the system of 'set aside'
whose opponents say discriminates against large farms, and over future
prices for cereals, Mr Cunha said. Portugal as EC president had to try to
find flexible and more acceptable alternatives 'that did not prejudice
production controls and the budget", he said.
The two ministers agreed that reform could not be achieved without taking
into account the lives of the community's farmers. 'We agree on the need for
a policy with a human face,' Mr Kiechle said.
