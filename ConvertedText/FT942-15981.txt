FT  13 APR 94 / Industry hopes lift in Germany

German industry expects to grow more quickly than previously predicted,
according to a survey of 356 leading companies by the Munich-based Ifo
economic research institute. Industrial production is expected to rise by
1.25 per cent this year, compared with predictions in a similar survey last
summer of a 0.5 per cent fall. A growth rate of 2.5 per cent is predicted
for 1995.
Many companies were so shocked by the intensity of last year's recession
that they were loath to predict any recovery, the report said, explaining
the sudden turnaround. Most branches of the economy expect real growth rates
in the second quarter compared with the corresponding period last year.
Higher export orders and growing demand in the engineering and car
industries are now set to lift production in these sectors by 1.75 per cent
this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995. However, output will only match mid-1989
production levels, the survey said. Sluggish demand in the west German
economy means consumer goods production is expected to shrink 1.25 per cent
this year before picking up 0.25 per cent next year.
