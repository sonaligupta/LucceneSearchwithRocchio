FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Storm runs into Pounds 98,000 losses


STORM GROUP, the West Midlands-based video and book publishing concern, ran
up pre-tax losses of Pounds 98,000 in 1991. This compared with an expected
out-turn of about break-even and with Pounds 369,000 profits for the
previous 13 months.
Mr James Driscoll, chairman, blamed the setback on the adverse effect on
short-term profits due to senior management time being spent on major
acquisitions during the final quarter.
In addition, Pounds 60,000 profit from 1991 had been deferred until this
year due to a requested delay in delivery of books and videos.
Mr Driscoll said that although 1991 was a disappointing year in terms of
results, Storm's market position was now stronger and it was making
significant strides towards meeting its objectives of becoming a leading
animation and licensing organisation in Europe.
He reported that during the first four months of 1992 the group had traded
profitably at the pre-tax level.
Turnover for the year increased to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 985,000 for 13
months) mainly because of a full contribution from A4 Publications, the
licensing publications offshoot, compared with only two months in 1990.
Net interest received fell to Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 253,000) reflecting the
production costs of three cartoon animation series and lower interest rates.
An extraordinary charge this time of Pounds 290,000 related to a provision
against Storm's investment in its 50 per cent owned associate, Storm
Education.
Losses per share were 0.002p (0.68p earnings). The company's shares trade on
the USM.
