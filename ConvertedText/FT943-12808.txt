FT  22 JUL 94 / International Company News: AT&T in black midway after solid
second quarter


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


AT&T, the largest US telecommunications group, yesterday reported solid
second-quarter profits of Dollars 1.13bn, or 83 cents a share. In the same
quarter a year ago the group earned Dollars 1.01bn, or 74 cents restated to
account for accounting changes.
The second-quarter profits took first-half 1994 earnings to Dollars 2.22bn.
A year ago, AT&T reported a first-half loss of Dollars 5.8bn, but excluding
the impact of accounting changes, earnings in the period totalled Dollars
1.94bn.
The improvement in second-quarter results was attributed by AT&T to strong
revenue growth from its long-distance telecommunications, equipment
manufacturing and financial services businesses. Total revenues in the
quarter were Dollars 17.7bn, up 8.7 per cent from a year earlier.
The results were well received by investors on Wall Street, who bid up the
company's stock Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange in early trading.
AT&T's core long-distance business posted a 5 per cent increase in revenues
to Dollars 10.34bn.
The accelerating pace of economic activity, plus strong sales of new
consumer services, lifted calling volume 7 per cent during the period.
Revenues from the group's products and systems division climbed 19 per cent
to Dollars 4.9bn, with network telecommunications products and systems sales
in the US and overseas growing sharply, and the computer business (formerly
NCR) posting a profit on strong equipment sales.
Although rentals and other services revenues declined slightly to Dollars
1.69bn, earnings from the financial services business, which runs equipment
financing, leasing and credit card services, jumped 23 per cent to Dollars
723m.
