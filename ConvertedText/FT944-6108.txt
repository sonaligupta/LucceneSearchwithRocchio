FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: World wheat production estimate
reduced further


   By ALISON MAITLAND


This year's world wheat production estimate has been revised down again to
526m tonnes - 32m tonnes below last year - with stocks estimated to be at
their lowest level for 15 years, the International Wheat Council said
yesterday.
It put global wheat output 4m tonnes lower than last month's estimate, the
latest in a steady downgrading since the start of the year, when it forecast
a crop of 562m tonnes.
The further fall is blamed mainly on reduced output in Russia and Ukraine.
The Russian harvest is estimated to be 7.6m tonnes lower than last year's at
35.9m tonnes. The planted area was down because of a chronic shortage of
inputs, and harvesting was hampered by poor weather in central Russia and
the Urals. Early frosts may have meant that 6 per cent of the crop was not
harvested.
In Ukraine, the harvest is put at 15.3m tonnes, down 5.7m tonnes from last
year, because of an unusually hot summer.
World wheat stocks are 2m tonnes lower than last month's estimate at 104m
tonnes, the smallest figure since 1979-80.
However, overall grain production for the year is estimated to be 42m tonnes
higher than in 1993 at 1.39bn tonnes because of an increase in coarse grain
production, mainly in the US. Output of coarse grains is put at 864m tonnes
 -up 10m tonnes on last month's forecast and 74m tonnes higher than in 1993.
The estimate for the record US maize crop has been raised again to 254.3m
tonnes, up 93.1m on last year. Coarse grain crops were also bigger in
central Europe and the Balkans, India and Morocco.
The IWC tentatively expects wheat production to recover to 560m tonnes next
year. Cereal growers in the European Union and the US have responded to
higher prices resulting from tightening supplies and declining stocks, it
says.
But it warns that continued economic problems in central Europe, the Balkans
and much of the former Soviet Union could inhibit growth in output.
