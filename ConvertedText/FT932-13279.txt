FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): No regrets
over missed opportunity in Japan - Now the four agree on basic equity
indicators, though they differ in their attitudes to bonds / The
Professionals


   By DAVID DODWELL


HINDSIGHT SHOWS that our professionals would have reaped greatest gains over
the first quarter of 1993 by putting funds into Japanese equities, which
rose by more than 20 per cent in sterling terms.
All conceded that they missed the opportunity, but none mourned the loss.
Even now, only one is edging tentatively back into the market.
Instead, they were satisfied with gains on the quarter ranging from 6 per
cent to 11 per cent, and probably slept more easily at night without an
unpredictable Japanese market to worry about.
There remain strong agreements on the fundamental constellation of
investment indicators: the dollar and the yen are set to continue
strengthening; recession in Germany and Japan continue to cast a long
shadow; the US and UK equity markets are expensive and need careful stock
selection. In Europe, Germany gets a universal cold shoulder, while the
markets to favour are France, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
All wax enthusiastic about the smaller Asian markets: 'It is difficult not
to get carried away in describing prospects in 1993 and beyond,' comments
Paul Myners. Tim Howe has even dipped a toe into the long neglected
Australian market - 'the purest commodity play' - in expectation of rising
commodity prices.
Of course, the war of words between China and Britain over the future of
Hong Kong led to some nail biting over this key regional market, though at
the end of the quarter, with the Hang Seng index 18.3 per cent higher, only
Japan reported a stronger performance.
Douglas McDougall exudes the greatest confidence here: 'We believe the
outlook for Hong Kong depends on developments within China itself, and that
the favourable momentum of recent years will be sustained as China continues
to liberalise its economy.'
Attitudes about bonds remain mixed. Howard Beaufort detects a 'particularly
favourable environment for high quality international bonds'; Douglas
McDougall is comfortable to move from French to UK bonds because of higher
yields; but Paul Myners is busily transferring into equities, and is
'delighted to have no exposure to conventional gilts'.
Douglas McDougall (Baillie Gifford) has used 5 per cent of his 20 per cent
in European equities to lift his UK equity holding to 45 per cent, where
'signs of recovery are becoming more clear'. He says: 'Budget and trade
deficits remain worries. But profits are likely to rise quite strongly this
year and in 1994.' He believes the UK market is not cheap 'but compares well
with most other markets'.
Mr McDougall says the continental European markets look expensive compared
with the UK, as does the US equity market. He remains 'most optimistic' and
'most overweight' in the small Pacific markets.
The only other change to his portfolio is to reap a currency gain by selling
his 7 1/2 per cent holding in French bonds and buying UK gilts instead.
Paul Myners (Gartmore) is diluting his US bonds by 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per
cent, and his European bond holding from 10 per cent to 4 per cent, keeping
this last tranche in French bonds only.
Instead, he is acquiring a 5 per cent holding in large capitalisation US
equities, boosting his overall equity holding in the US to 15 per cent. Of
this, two thirds is in large capitalisation stocks, and one third in small
companies.
He is using the 6 per cent raised from selling European bonds to buy three
equal equity stakes in France, Switzerland and the Netherlands - a clear
modification of his view in December that Europe's equity markets look 'more
and more like an economic disaster'. Mr Myners remains clear that Germany
offers 'very poor value at present'.
Of his 50 per cent UK equity holding, one fifth is now in small companies,
which, he says, are 'still undervalued'.
Howard Beaufort (Newton Investment Management) has boosted his UK equity
holdings by 4 per cent to 48 per cent, funding the shift by taking profits
on US equities, which now stand at 6 per cent of the portfolio: 'Even
against a background of the UK market continuing to move sideways, investors
will continue to achieve an attractive return through the concentration in
stocks of high quality companies, able to make progress in a weak business
environment because of enduring competitive advantages.'
He remains confident about his continental European equity holdings, which
are buoyed by lower interest rates, low inflation, and recovery prospects in
1994. He emphasises that many are global in their operations, so not heavily
influenced by recession across Europe.
Mr Beaufort retains his 20 per cent cash and bond holding, confident of the
'benign environment' for financial markets.
Tim Howe (Singer & Friedlander) has trimmed his UK equity holdings from 65
per cent to 62 per cent of the portfolio, adding a little to his equity
holdings on the continent of Europe, and acquiring a new 2 per cent holding
in Australia.
'The investment in Australia is already proving rewarding,' he says.
In the UK, he is reducing exposure to second- and third-liners after 'sharp
price rises' in the first quarter, reinvesting profits in market leaders. He
expects the upside to be limited in the UK by the weight of rights issues
and new issues on the market.
On the continent, Mr Howe sees stock selection as critical, favouring
France, Holland and Switzerland. In the US, he feels that recovery will
underpin the market, though he has taken some profits.
He remains active in Asia, even 'tentatively investing' back into Japan,
where he feels 'the market could surprise investors with the speed of its
turn around'.
Like his fellow professionals, Mr Howe's bond holdings are focused on
France. He has opted to take some profits on his US bonds, but feels that
long-dated UK gilts 'should rise a little'.
This feature is not a competition but an allocation exercise, to see how
four professional fund managers handle a Pounds 250,000 portfolio on behalf
of a hypothetical client - for instance, a wealthy individual or a small
self-administered pension fund.
The managers emphasise that they are investing for the long term (10 years
or more) rather than for short-term gain. The exercise started in October
1990. The portfolios given here were drawn up at the beginning of this
month, and will be reviewed at the end of June.
