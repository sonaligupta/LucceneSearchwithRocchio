FT  15 APR 94 / DTI to privatise laboratories


The Department of Trade and Industry is to privatise next year the National
Engineering Laboratory and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. It will
also put the National Physical Laboratory, which oversees national
measurement standards, under private management.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said a review by KPMG
Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, had concluded the laboratories would
have greater flexibility in the private sector.
