FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Raglan picks up


Raglan Properties, the development and investment company, announced an
increase in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 89,000 to Pounds 3.07m,
reflecting an expansion in its portfolio and a pick-up in the property
sector.
Turnover for the six months to September 30 advanced to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds
4.9m). Earnings per share jumped to 2.71p (0.3p).
Raglan has undergone a transformation over the past 20 months, including a
share consolidation, financial restructuring and new management.
In September, the company had its second rights issue in nine months in
which it raised about Pounds 21.6m after costs, in a 3-for-4 issue which was
to acquire Letinvest, now Raglan Estates.
Gross rental income was Pounds 2.22m (Pounds 304,000) and the profit on sale
of investment properties was Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 184,000). The figures
included the purchase of Letinvest from September 20.
A final dividend, the first since 1989, is planned for this year.
