FT  27 SEP 94 / Economic accord lifts currency in Mexico


   By DAMIAN FRASER


   MEXICO CITY


The Mexican peso strengthened yesterday and secondary market interest rates
eased on the first day of trading after renewal of the annual economic pact
between the government, business and unions.
The government resisted pressure in the pact to boost short-term economic
growth, deciding to leave exchange rate policy unchanged and to run a
balanced budget next year.
The pact committed the government of Mr Ernesto Zedillo, which is due to
take office in early-December, to an inflation rate target of 4 per cent
next year, from the current rate of just under 7 per cent.
The decision to push for a lower inflation rate at the expense of higher
short-term economic growth was seen as positive news for the peso and for
fixed-income instruments.
'The announcement will be sufficient to restore calm to the foreign exchange
and money markets, after the speculation last week,' said Mr Lawrence
Goodman, vice-president at Salomon Brothers.
'This was an aggressive move to instil confidence in the market.'
The peso, after strengthening on Friday as rumours of a renewed pact reached
the market, climbed further yesterday, and closed at 3.378 to the dollar.
