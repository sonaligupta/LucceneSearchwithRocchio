FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Chevron to axe 2,500 jobs and
reduce costs


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


CHEVRON, the fourth biggest US oil and gas company, is to cut its workforce
by 2,500 people, about 5 per cent, and record a Dollars 270m fourth-quarter
charge as part of a restructuring plan.
Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that 500 of the 2,500 jobs being
eliminated related to a decision to downsize the company's refinery in Port
Arthur, Texas. The refinery represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total
petroleum refining capacity and its partial or full closure has been under
review for some time.
Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He said
low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and reduced
demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial results.
Mr Derr said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year.
Among the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing
 -this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut
capacity by a third to 200,000 barrels a day.
The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early
retirement, organisational changes and asset sales.
Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m fourth-quarter after-tax
charges would relate to the Port Arthur refinery. If the refinery is shut
down Chevron would incur an additional Dollars 200m charge.
Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more
of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental
regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than
Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries.
The Chevron chief said the company's 1992 capital and exploration budget
would total Dollars 5.3bn, 6 per cent higher than last year.
In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to
Dollars 313m.
Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand
 -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum
Institute (API). The industry association said that oil's share of domestic
US energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, it lowest level
in 40 years.
Mr Edward Murphy, API's finance director, said the statistics gathered for
last year indicate 'that the exploration and production sectors of the
petroleum industry in the US have entered a period of accelerated decline,
while there is accelerated growth overseas'.
