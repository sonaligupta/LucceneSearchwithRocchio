Robeco

Robeco, the Dutch-based investment fund manager, said assets under
management rose by 42 per cent to a record Fl 65.8bn (Dollars 34bn) in 1993
from Fl 46.4bn in 1992.
The surge was due to an increase in the value of assets, reflecting buoyant
capital markets, and a 25 per cent rise in client base to 600,000 investors.
Robeco's strategic partnership with Rabobank, the Dutch co - operative bank,
yielded around Fl 5bn in new funds from investors seeking to compensate for
the decline in interest paid on savings accounts.
Robeco said all its investment funds showed 'excellent' results last year.
Its funds include equity, bond, money market and property investment
vehicles.
The group's flagship Robeco equity fund, which invests in shares around the
world, achieved a performance of 30.0 per cent in 1993, compared with 9.6
per cent in 1992.
