FT  29 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Elections are key to next EC
president


   From Mr BEN PATTERSON MEP


Sir, Your editorial, 'Eurosuperman step forward' (April 27), on the
appointment of a new European Commission president omitted one crucial fact.
It is true that there will be 'an obscure political bargaining process' over
the next two months, but it will be to select only a nominee for president.
The final decision on both the presidency and the Commission as a whole will
be taken in December, and not by the national governments. It will be taken
by the European parliament.
This is one reason why the elections to the parliament on June 9 are of
greater importance than in the past. Whichever political tendency gains the
upper hand will wish to see its views reflected in the Commission.
It was, indeed, precisely so that this would be the case that the
Commission's terms of office was changed by the Maastricht Treaty so as to
coincide as closely as possible with that of the parliament.
Ben Patterson
European parliament,
97-113 rue Belliard,
1040 Brussels,
Belgium
