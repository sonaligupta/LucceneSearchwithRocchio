FT  06 SEP 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System


The decline of the Belgian franc was the dominant feature of the European
exchange rate mechanism's grid last week. At the start of the week, it was
third from bottom of the system, separated by 4.25 percentage points from
the weakest currency, the Danish krone. By the close on Friday, it had
fallen to second from bottom, only 2.80 percentage points from Denmark's
currency. The grid's currencies are diverging in general: some 8.71
percentage points separate the weakest and strongest, more than half the
permitted divergence. Currencies, Page 35; Further D-Mark rises foreseen,
