FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Trinity acquires Argus newspapers


Trinity International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily
Post and Echo, is acquiring the 27 local newspapers owned by Argus Press.
The move follows last week's approval of the deal by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Trinity is paying Pounds 20.7m in cash for the south of England pre-paid and
free titles. In addition, Trinity will pay a further estimated Pounds 1.5m
cash for stock, reimbursement for the benefit of pre-payments and to assume
trade creditors. In the year ended March 31 1993, the assets being acquired
made a net profit of about Pounds 600,000 on turnover of Pounds 25m, with a
net book value of about Pounds 5.7m.
The deal gives Trinity a presence in the south of England for the first time
and furthers its strategic aim of expanding and diversifying its regional
newspaper interests.
