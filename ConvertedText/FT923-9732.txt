FT  04 AUG 92 / Britain seeks to defuse border control dispute


   By DAVID OWEN and ANDREW HILL


   LONDON, BRUSSELS


MR Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is examining how further to lighten the
burden on European Community citizens posed by British immigration and
passport controls, in an attempt to defuse the long-running dispute over
Britain's intention to retain border checks beyond the end of this year.
But the European Commission is maintaining that all border controls must be
lifted from January 1, 1993.
According to the Home Office, Mr Clarke has given an undertaking to Mr
Martin Bangemann, European internal market commissioner, that he will
'reflect on what more could be done to lighten the touch on EC nationals'.
Mr Bangemann yesterday denied reports that the Commission had already agreed
to allow the UK to keep border controls on people. He said Brussels stuck to
its interpretation of the Single European Act, which aims to establish a
barrier-free internal market.
He and Mr Clarke will meet again on September 1 to discuss the issue.
In theory the Commission could take any member state which retains border
controls to the European Court of Justice. It is more likely that the
January 1 deadline will be postponed, as other EC members are worried that
external borders will not be strong enough to allow all controls to be
lifted.
The Home Office said that Britain's determination to retain immigration
controls on third-country nationals travelling from EC countries would
require a 'light' passport check on EC nationals 'simply to establish their
nation-ality'.
Mr Clarke told EC immigration ministers in June that it would not be in
anyone's interest to have 'a major row' on the issue, 'especially given the
difficulties surrounding ratification of the Maastricht treaty'.
