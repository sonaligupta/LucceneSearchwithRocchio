FT  28 JUL 92 / Gregory cleared in Mirror Group inquiry


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


MIRROR Group Newspapers yesterday announced that Mr Robert Gregory, director
of human resources, had been cleared of any 'improper conduct or
shortcomings' as a result of an internal inquiry, Raymond Snoddy writes.
It said the outcome of the inquiry was being published because a question
asked at the recent annual general meeting made shareholders aware of the
inquiry.
MGN did not say what the allegations against Mr Gregory had been, although
the company had always stressed he had never been accused of any illegality.
Mr Gregory, the company said, would continue in his post and the inquiry had
not interrupted his work.
The inquiry is believed to have looked at the transfer of Mr Gregory's
pension from Maxwell Communication Corporation to MGN. It was found to be in
order following a change in Mr Gregory's role.
