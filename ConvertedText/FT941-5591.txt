FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies up 30% as sales start to
improve


   By TIM BURT


The first signs of recovery in the commercial printing industry helped boost
profits by 38 per cent at Litho Supplies, the printing products distributor
which came to the market last November.
Maiden results of the Midlands-based group showed pre-tax profits ahead to
Pounds 4.63m (Pounds 3.35m) in the 12 months to December 31.
The rise was fuelled mainly by rising sales in southern England in the last
quarter, which helped overall turnover improve 10 per cent to Pounds 60.2m
(Pounds 54.7m).
Mr John Byford, joint managing director, said that before last September -
when demand started to increase - trading conditions had been patchy at
best.
'We began to see an upturn at the end of last year, but it has not been a
dramatic improvement,' he said.
The pick-up, however, was enough to push year-end profits 7 per cent ahead
of flotation forecasts of Pounds 4.33m.
Of the three distribution arms, sales by the electronic equipment division
showed the sharpest increase, up 87 per cent to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 4.5m).
Turnover rose by a more modest 4 per cent in consumable products such as
film, chemicals and printing plates. The division continued to dominate the
business, accounting for Pounds 49.1m (Pounds 47.3m) of sales.
Mr Byford said an improved performance by these two businesses helped offset
weak sales of traditional printing equipment, down Pounds 200,000 at Pounds
2.7m.
Together, the divisions contributed to a 21 per cent increase in operating
profits to Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 4.72m).
The results were also boosted by a cut in interest payments following the
group's decision to use most of the proceeds of last year's Pounds 14.1m
placing and intermediaries offer to cut borrowing to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds
10m).
Earnings per share were 12.9p (8.6p) and a dividend of 0.7p is payable for
the period between flotation and the year end.
The shares, placed at 190p last year, were unchanged at 274p.
