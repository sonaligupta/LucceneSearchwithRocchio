FT  06 AUG 93 / Allies remain hesitant over air strikes: It is still unclear
if the allies will fulfil threats to act against the Serbs encircling
Sarajevo


   By GILLIAN TETT


SENIOR NATO commanders met at the allied headquarters in Belgium yesterday
to draw up logistical plans for possible air strikes to be presented to a
meeting of the organisation's military committee today.
But as the diplomatic wrangling continued between the US and UN about who
should control the air strikes and what their objective should be, it was
still unclear whether the allies would fulfil their threats to act against
the Serb forces encircling Sarajevo.
An official at the British Ministry of Defence said: 'As far as we are
concerned, we are ready to go in if the order is given.
'But to start military action you need a clear military objective and a
clear political aim. The problem is we don't have either yet.'
Under the terms of the compromise agreement hammered out after 12 hours of
acrimonious discussions in Brussels three days ago, Nato has threatened to
launch air strikes for two separate purposes: first, to defend UN troops in
Bosnia if they come under attack; and second, to break the Serbian
'stranglehold' on Sarajevo.
Under pressure from the European allies, who are determined to avoid being
sucked into further military conflict, Nato diplomats yesterday stressed
they would seek UN authority to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they block aid
convoys, but would not interfere in battles like those taking place in the
mountains around Sarajevo.
'We are essentially just fulfilling the UN humanitarian mandate. We have no
other purpose there,' a Nato official in Brussels yesterday said.
But recent statements from the White House have prompted some European
observers to fear that the US is considering an expanded military aim for
the air strikes: to attack key Serbian positions outside Sarajevo or even
target specific commanders and buildings.
Considerable disagreement between the US and the European allies persists
even about what the definitions of self-defence and the UN's humanitarian
mission should be.
These stem in part from the different dispositions (if any) of the troops of
the western allies.
The Canadians, with ground troops in Srebrenica surrounded by Serbian
forces, were the most vociferous this week in arguing against Washington
proposals for air strikes. The French, with troops in Sarajevo and recently
under Serb fire, have also expressed fears that air strikes other than those
launched to fend off any attacks could endanger forces on the ground.
There are also doubts in Europe about the effectiveness of air power on its
own. A French military expert yesterday said that although France had agreed
to the bombing of Serbian positions because the fall of Sarajevo was at
stake, it had doubts about what it will really achieve.
He added that France's position was based on a desire to show support for
Moslems - and on deep uncertainty, shared by most of its allies, over what
to do should Sarajevo fall.
Britain's troops are primarily located in Moslem and Croat areas, but Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, was yesterday at pains to stress
that the protection of the troops remained at the forefront of British
policy.
The allies' caution has been accompanied by anger that the American
proposals for air strikes have been made without any commitment for American
ground troops in Bosnia.
Echoing fears that other military officials have expressed, Dr Jonathan Eyal
of the Royal United Services Institute in London yesterday said: 'The fear
is that the UN is merely acting as a fig leaf for the Americans. They will
go in and then get out again like they did in Somalia, leaving the UN and
the allies picking up the pieces.'
Against this background, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, has
reiterated that he wishes to retain full control of any action in Bosnia.
UN officials, together with the French, have argued that the operations
should remain under the control of the French commander of the UN forces in
the former Yugoslavia, General Jean Cot.
The Americans, by contrast, are insisting that air strikes should be
co-ordinated by Admiral Jeremy Boorda, commander of the Allied Forces
Southern Europe.
Nato officials yesterday insisted that although they were prepared to act
under a United Nations brief, Nato was the only institution with sufficient
military experience to run the operations.
'The UN is a political and cultural institution. It does not have the
experience to run a military operation,' said a Nato official.
