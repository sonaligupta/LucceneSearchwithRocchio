FT  09 NOV 94 / US backing for Polish minister


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI


   WARSAW


US officials in Poland for talks on Nato expansion yesterday backed Mr Piotr
Kolodziejczyk, the defence minister, who is under strong pressure from
President Lech Walesa to resign. Mr Joseph Kruzel, US deputy assistant
defence secretary, said that Poland 'was fortunate to have dedicated public
servants such as Mr Kolodziejczyk' and he reiterated that Nato membership
was impossible for a country without civilian control over the military.
President Walesa has sided with army generals who blame Mr Kolodziejczyk for
failing to wrest sufficient funds out of the government and want one of
their number to replace him. The drive is seen as a severe weakening of
civilian control over the military.
Mr Kruzel said discussions with the central European countries about Nato
membership would start next year.
