FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: State set to offer 43% of Tele
Danmark


   By HILARY BARNES


   COPENHAGEN


THE DANISH government is preparing to sell off a large minority stake in
Tele Danmark, the state's monopoly telephone company.
Mr Arne Melchior, communications minister, said the government was prepared
to reduce its present 94 per cent holding in Tele Danmark to 51 per cent
within the next 12 months.
The company was formed in 1991 through the merger of five regional telephone
companies. The shares were yesterday suspended on the Copenhagen stock
exchange at DKr170 (Dollars 27).
Plans to sell off shares to the public have been delayed several times by
political difficulties.
The shares currently carry two conditions which mean that the share price
does not reflect the value of the group. This has made them unattractive to
private investors.
