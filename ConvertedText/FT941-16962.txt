FT  07 JAN 94 / Russian performance on economy improves


   By JOHN LLOYD

The Russian economy posted a drop in inflation, stability in industrial
output and a rise in real wages and prices during the last quarter of 1993,
according to figures released yesterday by the Centre for Economic Reforms.
Wages averaged Dollars 105 (Pounds 70.90) a month in December, with prices
at about 30 per cent of those in the US.
Mr Andrei Illarionov, the centre's deputy director, said yesterday that the
level of inflation, down to around 12 per cent last month, would drop to
about 10 per cent a month in the first quarter of this year. But he warned
that a rise in the budget deficit this quarter would mean a further surge of
inflation from April. On present policies, unemployment would rise from its
present level of about 1m to around 3m during this year.
The squeeze on inflation, running at nearly 30 per cent in August, has been
accomplished by a drop in credits issued to commercial banks and to the
other former Soviet states. Figures from the centre show no credits were
advanced to neighbouring states from October, after a rate of advance which
in July reached nearly 5 per cent of Russian GDP.
Mr Illarionov said the drop in inflation meant the central bank's interest
rates, now at some 17 per cent a month, were strongly positive for the first
time. If these trends continued, interest rates would be brought down.
The rate of the rouble against the dollar has stabilised since September, at
just over 1,200 to Dollars 1. But the real exchange rate against the dollar
has dropped to about 10 per cent of its level two years ago.
Mr Illarionov said the growing price levels were putting increasing pressure
on Russian exporters.
One of the 'sharpest political questions' in the next few months would be
the demand for protection and increased import tariffs.
