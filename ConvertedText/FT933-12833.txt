FT  22 JUL 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Review expects real
growth


   By GARY MEAD


GLOBAL advertising expenditure is not experiencing the kind of upturn that
has been predicted by some pundits at the start of 1993, but in the UK at
least there are indications that the worst of the recession may be over.
The media buying and planning company Zenith - part of the Saatchi and
Saatchi group - forecasts international real growth of 0.5 per cent this
year, compared with real growth of 0.2 per cent for 1992.
In its latest advertising expenditure review of 38 international markets,*
Zenith offers a patchy outlook for advertising spend in Europe's seven
biggest markets, which account for 93 per cent of the European Community's
consumers.
In real terms, spending on all forms of advertising in 1993 is forecast to
grow by 0.5 per cent in Belgium; to shrink by 5.8 per cent in France; to
increase by 1.7 per cent in Germany; to rise by 1.1 per cent in Italy; to
drop by 1.1 per cent in the Netherlands; and to decline by 2 per cent in
Spain.
There are predictions that the market will increase by 1.9 per cent in the
UK.
Nor is the North American market predicted to come surging out of the
recession, with real increases of less than 1 per cent a year forecast for
the current and also the next two years. For significant improvements, Asia
and the Pacific areas are still in advance of other regions.
The report forecasts real growth of 1.5 per cent in 1993, 3.6 per cent in
1994 and 4.4 per cent in 1995, which is more than double the international
average forecast for each year.
