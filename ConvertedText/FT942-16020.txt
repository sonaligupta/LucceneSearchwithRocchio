FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Untrustworthy


When is a unit trust a fund? When it's called the M & G Sterling High
Interest Fund, launched this week. Somehow, trying to drum up support for
the M & G Sterling High Interest Trust doesn't sound quite right, especially
when it is stripped down to its bare initials.
