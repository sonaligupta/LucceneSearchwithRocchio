FT  30 APR 94 / Seoul rejects treaty proposal: International News Digest


   By JOHN BURTON


   SEOUL


The US and South Korea have rejected a proposal by North Korea to replace
the armistice agreement ending the Korean War of 1950-53 with a peace treaty
between Pyongyang and Washington. Washington and Seoul said the dispute over
North Korean nuclear inspections must be resolved first before a peace
treaty would be considered.
North Korea has revived the peace treaty proposal, one of its main
diplomatic goals, as part of an attempt to win a security guarantee from the
US, possibly in exchange for allowing full nuclear inspections. Pyongyang
has refused to consider signing a peace treaty with Seoul by claiming South
Korea is not a signatory to the armistice.
North Korea has threatened not to participate further in meetings of the
military armistice commission if negotiations are not opened with the US on
a peace agreement. It has also warned that it will try to disband the
neutral nations supervisory commission, including Sweden, Switzerland and
Poland, that oversees the armistice agreement.
