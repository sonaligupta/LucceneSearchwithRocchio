FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: High catastrophe losses hit
Cigna

CIGNA, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, yesterday unveiled
underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09-a-share compared with
Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991.
Cigna's chairman, Mr Wilson Taylor, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide
property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses, particularly from
the Los Angeles riots.
Earlier this month, the company warned that its results would fall below
analysts' expectations of about Dollars 1.25 a share, but did not give
specific reasons.
Mr Taylor said that the company had started reviewing its London property
and casualty reinsurance operations because of recent concerns about the
London reinsurance market.
The company is looking particularly closely at 'those losses arising from
large catastrophes occurring over the last several years.'
'The effect of the review is not reasonably estimable at this time, but is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporation's
consolidated financial condition.'
Cigna's pre-tax catastrophe losses climbed to Dollars 55m, including Dollars
39m from the Los Angeles riots, from Dollars 11m a year earlier.
Net income for the three months to June 30 were Dollars 125m, or Dollars
1.74 a share including one-time gains of Dollars 47m.
A year earlier, Cigna had net income of Dollars 170m, or Dollars 2.38
including one-time after-tax gains of Dollars 36m.
For the first half, Cigna had net income of Dollars 231m, or Dollars 3.22 a
share, including after-tax gains of Dollars 70m.
For the same period of 1991, Cigna earned Dollars 218m, or Dollars 3.05 a
share, including extraordinary gains of Dollars 41m.
Premiums and fees for the group overall in the second quarter were Dollars
3.45bn compared with Dollars 3.6bn a year ago, while net investment income
totalled Dollars 970m compared with Dollars 960m.
For the first half, premiums and fees stood at Dollars 6.9bn while net
investment income totalled Dollars 1.96bn.
A year earlier, premiums and fees were Dollars 7.2bn while net investment
income was Dollars 1.93bn.
