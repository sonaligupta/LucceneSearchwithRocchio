FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Trend is down - Annuities


   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau


Although the table shows that many annuity rates have moved up since a month
ago, most competitive providers have reduced theirs, including Generali,
Prudential, Sun Life of Canada, Canada Life and Royal Life.
A few companies have maintained rates but the trend is downwards. Again, the
movement is linked to inflation, this time with indications that inflation
is under control. In the short term, rates should continue to fall.

TOP ANNUITY RATES
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump
sum investment. The bulk of the fund built up by many types of pension
plan must be used in this way. This week's table shows COMPULSORY
PURCHASE ANNUITY RATES which are used for small company schemes,
additional voluntary contribution plans (AVCs) and free standing AVCs
(FSAVCs) among others.  The rates do not include inflation proofing.
