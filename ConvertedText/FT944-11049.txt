FT  08 NOV 94 / Norwich Union set to reduce workforce by 2,000


   By ALISON SMITH


Norwich Union, one of the UK's largest insurers, has announced plans to shed
up to 2,000 jobs - a fifth of its workforce - within the next five years.
Mr Allan Bridgewater, chief executive, said the job cuts were needed because
the group had to achieve productivity gains of 40 per cent to 50 per cent
over the next 3 to 5 years to remain competitive.
The job losses will include compulsory redundancies, although Norwich Union
said it hoped the majority would be voluntary departures. About 450 staff
are on short-term contracts, and the group loses about 600 staff a year
through natural wastage.
Norwich Union is not alone among insurers in planning job cuts; in both
general and life insurance business companies are facing increasingly tough
competition.
The higher cost of meeting regulatory standards at a time of generally flat
life insurance and pensions sales is also putting pressure on margins.
In September, for example, Legal & General said it had already cut its sales
agents - who are self-employed and paid by commission - from 2,300 at the
start of the year to about 1,800. It expects this figure to fall to about
1,000 by the end of next year.
The contraction in the financial services industry was also underlined last
week in the annual report from the life industry's regulator. It showed that
the number of sales agents acting directly for life companies stood below
94,000 at the end of June, while in July 1991 it had totalled more than
twice that.
Yesterday's Norwich Union announcement is likely to hit the city of Norwich
particularly hard, as more than half of the group's staff work there.
It is not yet clear how the cuts will be spread across the group's general
insurance business - which employs 3,800 people - and its life and pensions
operation, which employs 4,500.
Some retrenchment on the life and pensions side was signalled in July, when
Norwich Union announced that the number of its branch offices was to be
almost halved, from 25 to 13.
