FT  24 MAR 92 / Mail-order launch by ex-Next chief


   By GARY MEAD


A MAIL-ORDER magazine is to be launched next week by Mr George Davies,
former head of the Next clothing chain, in his latest venture in clothing
retail, Gary Mead writes.
Mr Davies said the publication, which he describes as a 'magalogue', will be
a cross between a magazine and a mail-order catalogue.
The monthly publication will be given away with some newspapers, and will be
sold in retail newsagents Dillons.
Mr Davies said yesterday he had been 'impressed by changes in the newspaper
industry' and that desktop publishing technologies had made it possible to
produce a monthly mail-order magazine.
The venture has been funded by Mr Davies and a group of friends with Pounds
10m raised with 'very little' finance from banks.
