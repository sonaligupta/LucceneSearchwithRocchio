FT  27 MAR 92 / Allied to close John Bull brewery at Romford


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


ALLIED-LYONS, the third largest UK brewer, is to close its brewery at
Romford, Essex, by next February with the loss of 300 jobs.
The closure at Romford, the home of John Bull bitter, is the latest in a
series of brewery closures since the Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report in 1989 which prompted the government to try to encourage more
competition in the industry.
Bass has announced the closure of four breweries within the past year.
Others have been closed by Wolverhampton & Dudley and Scottish & Newcastle.
The brewers Boddington and Greenalls have left the industry.
Allied's decision to close the Romford brewery follows a review of the
group's production resources and its position in the beer market.
Mr Tony Trigg, managing director of Allied Breweries, said the move would
significantly reduce production costs and improve cost-effectiveness. He
said the market was increasingly competitive but depressed, and that beer
sales had fallen 4 per cent last year.
'Already there is too much capacity chasing reducing volumes,' Mr Trigg
said. 'We expect competition to increase further. It is important that
overall production and efficiencies are improved.'
The Romford brewery, which became part of the Allied group in 1961, employs
550 people and brews Skol, Castlemaine, and Lowenbrau lagers. It has been
operating well below its capacity of 1m barrels a year.
A phased closure of the plant will begin in September. Brewing of the brands
will be transferred to three of Allied's five remaining breweries at Burton
upon Trent, Leeds and Wrexham, Clwyd.
