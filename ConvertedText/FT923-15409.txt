FT  02 JUL 92 / Czechoslovak cabinet agreed


   By ARIANE GENILLARD


   BRATISLAVA


After three weeks of bitter negotiations, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime
minister-designate, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, have
agreed on a new 10-member federal cabinet, Ariane Genillard writes from
Bratislava. It will have only five key ministries and a limited mandate,
until the fate of Czechoslovakia's fragile, federation is decided, and will
be headed by Mr Jan Strasky, former Czech deputy premier.
