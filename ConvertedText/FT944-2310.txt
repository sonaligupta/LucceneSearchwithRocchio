FT  16 DEC 94 / International Company News: Confident Siemens sees 20%
advance in profits


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

Mr Heinrich von Pierer, Siemens chairman, yesterday forecast a 20 per cent
surge in profits in the current financial year as Europe's biggest
electrical and electronics group emerged strengthened from a cyclical and
structural crisis.
In spite of further pressure on prices, more costly rationalisation and
unchanged earnings from financial investments, net profits would increase to
about DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), he claimed. Sales would rise only about DM1bn
above the DM84.6bn achieved in 1993-94, while order intake would increase by
DM1.5bn to about DM90bn at most.
News of brightening horizons at Siemens gave a lift to the Frankfurt stock
exchange and the group's own shares closed DM20.5 higher at DM623.
Mr von Pierer announced his medium-term target of raising the group's return
on equity to 15 per cent from 9.4 per cent in the year under review and an
expected 10 per cent in the current financial year.
In response to criticism that Siemens was too heavily focused on maturing
markets, he said world markets offered long-term growth of 5-7 per cent a
year. The group had no great strategic needs such as acquisitions to enter
new markets or fill technological gaps, he added, although spending on
stakes in joint ventures in Asia would increase.
Confirming a 17 per cent fall in profits in the year to September 30 -
although extraordinary gains from disposals bolstered the final figure to
DM1.99bn - Mr von Pierer noted higher productivity had cancelled out the
effects of higher costs and lower selling prices.
In an unusually detailed report on the year just ended, Siemens provided for
the first time a breakdown of earnings by division. This showed, as
expected, falling losses in the Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI) information technology
division and a much-reduced financial result.
The mainstay business in telecommunications equipment and services generated
DM1.12bn in pre-tax profits, while SNI lost DM391m. Power generation and
distribution earned DM104m, the industry division DM119m, transport
equipment DM201m, components DM300m, medical technology DM239m, and Osram
lighting - including the US Sylvania acquisition for the first time -
DM291m. Profits from the energy and industrial products divisions fell
because of lower sales, price pressure and heavy restructuring costs.
Telecommunications earnings were hit by falling demand from east Germany and
price cuts. SNI reduced its loss by an estimated DM100m in spite of
continuing price cuts and high restructuring costs. According to Mr von
Pierer, lower prices cost the group DM2.8bn last year, while restructuring
rose DM800m to DM2.7bn.
Further rationalisation, including the loss of at least 12,000 jobs after
21,000 last year, would incur additional expense, although Mr Karl-Hermann
Baumann, finance director, refused to elaborate. SNI would make its first
operating profit in the current year, he added, although restructuring
charges would mean a further net deficit.
Financial earnings would be about the same as in 1993-94, when they fell to
DM1.3bn from DM1.85bn.
