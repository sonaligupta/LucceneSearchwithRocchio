FT  12 MAR 92 / NRA says national water grid would cost too much


   By JOHN HUNT


A NATIONAL GRID to pump water to regions affected by drought from those with
surpluses would be too expensive, the National Rivers Authority, the
environmental watchdog, said yesterday, John Hunt writes. Mr Jerry Sherriff,
the authority's head of water resources, said that a grid would cost
billions of pounds to construct and that extensive pumping equipment would
be needed for it.
An authority discussion paper issued yesterday covers options for obtaining
a more even water supply throughout the UK. The authority is examining the
long-term possibility of transferring water between river catchment areas as
a means of solving water shortages. It says water might be transferred from
wetter areas in the west and north to parts of the south-east where there
has been low rainfall in recent years.
The authority describes as 'fantasy' suggestions that icebergs could be
towed from the Arctic and melted for use in the water supply.
