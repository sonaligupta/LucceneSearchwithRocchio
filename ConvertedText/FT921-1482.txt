FT  24 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Ahlstrom increases stake in
Sibille-Dalle to 47%

   PARIS


FAMILY shareholders in Sibille-Dalle, one of the few remaining French-owned
paper groups, have agreed to sell a 34 per cent stake to Ahlstrom, the
diversified Finnish industrial group with interests in the paper business.
The deal, the price of which is not revealed, lifts Ahlstrom's investment in
Sibille-Dalle, an unquoted company with a turnover of FFr2.8bn (Dollars
500m) which makes specialist papers, from 13 per cent to 47 per cent. The
shares are being sold by the Bonduelle family, owners of vegetable canning
business of the same name.
The remaining majority stake will continue to be held by the Sibille-Dalle
family, which merged its paper interests with the Bonduelle paper business
two years ago.
This is the latest in a series of investments by Scandinavian pulp and paper
groups in the French paper industry, seen as attractive for its access to
cheap nuclear powered electricity - valuable to such an energy intensive
business - and to the main European paper markets.
In recent years, Finland's United Paper Mills has acquired French
paper-maker Stracel and Kymmene has taken over La Chapelle-Darblay, France's
main producer of newsprint. MoDo, the Swedish paper group, has taken over
Alicel, while Beghin-Corbehem has been acquired by Stora, another Swedish
group.
