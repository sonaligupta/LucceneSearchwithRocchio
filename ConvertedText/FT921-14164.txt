FT  17 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: TSB


The unflattering reason for the 5 per cent surge in TSB shares yesterday was
that its Pounds 47m pre-tax loss could have been worse. That is scarcely
grounds for the market to revise its view about the bank's long-term future.
Admittedly, the retail bank has had a good year, as has the insurance
business. But much of this must be due to a squeeze on costs which may not
have much further to run, while there must also be a limit on how much
insurance the bank can sell to its existing customers. As for Hill Samuel,
the loan book may now have been cleaned up at the expense of Pounds 432m in
provisions. But its profit before provisions was only Pounds 13m, hardly an
appetising return on Pounds 750m of capital.
In the current year the bank should have no difficulty returning to profit,
if only because the provisions should shrink. The dividend payment should be
easily covered, which may justify the decision to dip into reserves this
time. The more difficult question is where growth is coming from once the
bad debts are out of the way. For a bank as well capitalised as TSB, the
natural answer might be through acquisition. It would take astonishing
courage to revert to a route which has proved so disastrous in the past.
