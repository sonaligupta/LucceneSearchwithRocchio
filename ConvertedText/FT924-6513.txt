FT  20 NOV 92 / Observer: Inquest


Now more than ever, the founders of a company can't be too careful when
choosing its name. Take for instance Penna, the title redundancy consultants
Sanders and Sidney picked last year when renaming their quoted holding
company.
Checking on what it had been up to lately, a colleague consulted the FT's
computer database. Up came lurid tales of suicides, fire deaths and drug
overdoses.
The inquest shows that a certain totally unrelated Colin Penna is a coroner
in north-east England.
