FT  29 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Harland Simon acts to reassure shareholders


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


HARLAND SIMON, the loss-making controls systems group, yesterday acted to
reassure nervous investors who have seen the share price plunge from 585p in
February to last night's 15p.
The company said recent press comment had prompted clarification of its
trading status. 'The core businesses . . . are fundamentally sound and
capable of trading profitably', it said. Progress was being made on the
disposals of peripheral businesses, Vickerys, Contraves, Pro-Aqua and NEF.
The company also responded to reports of investor unrest over Harland's
relationship with PIL, a loss-making information network company. Harland's
pension fund has come under fire for a Pounds 500,000 investment in PIL.
Harland has repaid the money to the pension fund.
Harland stressed that shares held by Sandford Etablissements in PIL had at
no time been held for the benefit of a director of Harland, or a company in
the group.
The company said it had tried to obtain information about the beneficial
ownership of the shares, but without success. 'The board has always believed
that beneficial ownership was with Oerlikon Buhrle,' the statement said. The
group added that its investment in PIL would not be long-term. Harland holds
63 per cent of of the information network company.
Earlier this month, Harland announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.32m for the
year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 9.88m.
