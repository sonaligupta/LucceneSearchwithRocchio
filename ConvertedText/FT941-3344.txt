FT  16 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region depressed by lack
of foreign interest


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


   TOKYO


Profit-taking following Monday's rally depressed share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average finished marginally easier after moving within a narrow
range on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 17.30 at 20,508.85 after a day's high of 20,654.17 in the
morning and a low of 20,458.85 in the afternoon. Early buying by foreign
investors supported equities, but the Nikkei 225 was caught later between
profit-taking and arbitrage buying.
Traders were not discouraged by the falls because volume was heavy, with
some 550m shares changing hands, against Monday's 514m. A Japanese fund
manager said that while share prices still looked expensive on a
price/earnings ratio basis, the risk of a fall in values had declined,
helped by the fact that the economy seemed to have bottomed out. Rises
outpaced falls by 550 to 449, with 147 issues unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks added 3.07 at 1,642.94 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 0.43 at 302.31. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed
3.75 to 1,363.71.
Machinery issues drew buying after the release of favourable data showing an
increase in industry orders. Minebea rose Y33 to Y748 and Nachi Fujikoshi Y9
to Y443.
The yen's retreat against the dollar supported high-technology issues. Sony
put on Y30 at Y6,330 and TDK Y50 at Y4,450. However, some issues which had
improved on the multimedia theme declined. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
dipped Y2,000 to Y952,000 and Fujitsu eased Y10 to Y1,040.
Mining issues, which had risen in tandem with the gold price, were lower.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting declined Y9 to Y416 and Sumitomo Metal Mining Y4
to Y928.
Banks rose on arbitrage buying, Industrial Bank of Japan firming Y10 to
Y3,290 and Sakura Bank Y60 to Y1,390.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 65.55 to 22,438.38 in volume of 172.7m
shares. Roundup
Weak turnover and declining share prices typified the region. Kuala Lumpur,
Jakarta and Karachi remained closed for holidays.
HONG KONG's turnover was down from HKDollars 3.9bn to a provisional
HKDollars 3.47bn, against figures of more than HKDollars 10bn in late-1993
when the market was booming. The Hang Seng index ended a net 116.51, or 1.2
per cent, down at 9,863.56 after an early 120-point gain.
US funds took profits and selling mainly hit blue chips, with Henderson Land
falling HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 47.75, Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars
1.50 to HKDollars 58.50 and Hutchison Whampoa HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars
32.25.
TAIWAN saw turnover shrink to its lowest this year, down from TDollars
40.39bn to TDollars 34.29bn, as the weighted index finished 59.63, or 1.1
per cent, weaker at 5,274.24, just one point above its 1994 low.
The heavily weighted financial sector was among the biggest losers, with
China Trust and China Development down TDollars 2 apiece to TDollars 63.50
and TDollars 119 respectively. It was said that reduced buying by foreign
institutions was hurting the market.
COLOMBO blamed foreign inactivity or selling, local institutional
profit-taking and a drive for liquidity in the retail market as the
all-share index dropped a further 31.92, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,268.38.
Turnover expanded from Rs116m to Rs142.8m.
BOMBAY edged up, but brokers said that trade was virtually paralysed by the
implementation of a ban by the Securities and Exchange Board of India on
forward trading. The BSE 30-share index rose 11.06 to 3,758.28.
The SEBI, India's main regulator for capital markets, had said that the
carry forward, or badla system of trading, was leading to excessive
speculation, and that it would allow resumption of the system only if stock
exchanges implemented several measures to make trading more transparent.
NEW ZEALAND defied the regional trend, the NZSE-40 index moving ahead 27.98
to 2,249.41 as the market found support from stronger European bourses and a
more stable local bond market.
