FT  27 MAR 92 / People: Cosmopolitan Scot to Salvesen


SALVESEN, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire company, is
turning back to its home base of Edinburgh to find its next non-executive
chairman. It is choosing Alick Rankin, chairman of Scottish & Newcastle, to
replace John West who retires in July.
West, formerly chief executive of food group Reckitt & Colman, is now 64 and
has been chairman since 1989. He was brought on board to lend some outside
experience to the group on the retirement of Sir Gerald Elliott, a member of
the Salvesen family which still holds a total of 44 per cent n the company.
A few months later a new chief executive, Chris Masters, came in, and the
company's performance has markedly improved since then.
While West operated from London with occasional visits to Scotland, Rankin,
57, who has been non-executive director of Salvesen since 1986, is based in
Edinburgh. One of the most cosmopolitan members of the Scottish business
establishment, he gave up the post of chief executive of Scottish &
Newcastle early last year, and is evidently now looking to fresh pastures.
He recently became chairman of Scottish Financial Enterprise, the
organisation which lobbies for the Scottish financial sector.
