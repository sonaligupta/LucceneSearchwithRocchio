FT  08 NOV 94 / Former ANC fighters sacked


   By MARK SUZMAN


   JOHANNESBURG


Mr Joe Modise, South Africa's defence minister, announced yesterday that
over 2,000 former members of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the African National
Congress's armed wing, had been dismissed from the South African National
Defence Force for failing to report to duty despite numerous government
warnings. The decision marks a new hard line by the ANC-led government on
dissent by former guerrillas who have complained of harsh discipline and
poor living conditions while being assimilated into the SANDF. About 25,000
former Umkhonto members, and several thousand others from the former
homeland armies and the armed wing of the Pan Africanist Congress, are due
to join the once white-dominated South African army this year.
