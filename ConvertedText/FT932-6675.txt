FT  27 MAY 93 / Letter: Vive la reine


   From G SABBAGH


Sir, To have stated in your story 'Queen to be first UK monarch to meet
Irish president' (May 22/23) that 'even the French have been known to wave
flags for her' will, I hope, arouse the fury of many French readers who,
like myself, are enthusiastic admirers of the Queen.
The devotion of the French public to the British royal family is without
equal outside the UK.
