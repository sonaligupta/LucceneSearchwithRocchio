FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Gengold posts 16.9% decline

South African gold producer Gengold has posted a 16.9 per cent decline in
after-tax profit for the June quarter to R9.8m (Dollars 2.6m) from R11.8m in
the previous three months. The drop was largely due to lower productivity
and a higher tax rate which counteracted the effects of the improved gold
price.
Widespread election-related labour unrest across the group's mines, combined
with the large number of public holidays in the quarter, led to a 4 per cent
drop in tons milled to 2,602 from 2,711. This in turn caused overall gold
production to drop 3.9 per cent to 1,694kg from 1,763kg in the previous
quarter and is well down on the 1,839kg mined in the June quarter last year.
At the same time, overall taxation rose 30.6 per cent to R66.34m from
R50.81m, and the payment of a further R25.39m to cover the one-off, 5 per
cent transitional levy, announced in the June budget to help cover the cost
of the election, further dented the bottom line.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, admitted that labour unrest had been a
significant problem and was continuing, but said he expected the current
wave to subside gradually.
Mr Maude also noted that the group had now unwound all its forward hedging
with the exception of a small amount outstanding on the marginal Stilfontein
mine and so was poised to take full advantage of the improved spot gold
price in the next quarter.
Of the group's big mines Beatrix was least affected by the labour problems
and was able to use stockpiles to increase overall production slightly to
3,224kg from 3,220 in March. However, production at Kinross dropped from
3,030kg to 2,850kg while at Buffelsfontein it fell to 2,852 from 3,080kg.
Labour problems and the costs of the transitional levy also hit the gold
mines in the Anglovaal group as overall after-tax profit for the June
quarter fell to R45m from R70m. The total cost of the levy was R20.3m.
A combination of lower grade achieved and lower tonnage milled led
Hartebeestfontein, the group's flagship mine, to record a drop in after tax
profit to R40.2m, down from R62.6m in March. Gold production dipped to
6,550kg from 6,965kg.
