FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Former advisers face prospect of legal
action


   By ANDREW JACK


THE FORMER professional advisers to Queens Moat Houses were keeping a low
profile yesterday as the company contemplated legal action following the
release of its substantially restated accounts.
Accountants, surveyors, stockbrokers and merchant banks all face the
prospect of harsh shareholder criticism and possible lawsuits.
QMH stated publicly that it was 'reserving its position' with respect to
possible legal action against advisers.
Asked about the prospects for law suits, the company said: 'In the army,
this is what is known as a target-rich environment.'
The company is believed to have consulted lawyers about litigation, and is
initially focusing on those connected to the illegal decision to approve
dividend payments which it did not have the profits to meet.
Much focus will be on Bird Luckin, a small accountanting firm which audited
the accounts, and the former auditor from which, Mr Maurice Hart, joined the
QMH board.
Prior-year adjustments in the restated accounts for 1991 reduced pre-tax
profits from Pounds 90.4m to losses of Pounds 56.3m.
Weatherall Green and Smith, the chartered surveyors, was the only firm
willing to comment, and yesterday vigorously defended its valuation of
properties.
It placed a value on the company's assets at December 31 1991 - which was
adopted in the 1991 audited accounts - of Pounds 2bn.
Its own valuation one year later was about Pounds 1.3bn, and the valuation
adopted for the 1992 accounts by another surveyor, Jones Lang Wootton, was
Pounds 861m.
Mr Terry Knight, senior partner of Weatherall, said: 'We stand by those
figures. I can understand the layman's difficulty in understanding them but
we happen to believe that our figures are right.'
Other advisers included de Zoete & Bevan and Beeson Gregory, the
stockbrokers, and Charterhouse, its merchant bank.
