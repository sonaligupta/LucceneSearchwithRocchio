FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: Business travel tie-up for
Carlson and Accor

   PARIS


Carlson Companies of the US and Accor of France are pooling their business
travel operations in a joint venture, Carlson Wagonlit Travel (CWT), which
they plan to develop globally for their corporate clients.
With more than 4,000 travel agencies in 125 countries providing Dollars
10.8bn in revenue, they said the joint venture would have 8 per cent of the
world business travel market, 20 per cent ahead of their nearest rival,
American Express.
Through their combined purchasing power and synergies in computer
reservation systems and in developing a new travel credit card, the CWT
joint venture is aiming for a cheaper service for corporate clients.
The CWT joint venture will be 'a real working union, not a paper
partnership,' claimed Mr Travis Tanner, president of Carlson Travel.
However, the two parent groups will keep their respective hotel activities,
and even in business travel only envisage a full merger after their joint
activities are working smoothly.
