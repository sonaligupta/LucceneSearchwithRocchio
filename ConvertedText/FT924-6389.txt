FT  21 NOV 92 / Letter: Fund roads and rail track alike


   From Mr I R BLOOR


Sir, The conflict of interests over the Heathrow Express project, as you
correctly stated in your leading article, 'A rail link for Heathrow'
(November 17), does indeed go to the heart of the issue of whether private
train operators can make a commercial return while paying a full economic
price for the use of the railway track.
However, an alternative solution is available to that of increasing the
charges upon road users to obtain a better balance between the pricing of
road and rail facilities. Like roads, railway track and other infrastructure
have the characteristics of public goods in that, up to the point of full
capacity, their usage by one person or service does not preclude usage by
others.
Thus the railway infrastructure, like the roads, could be provided by the
state with users paying a proportion of the costs on an analogous basis to
the vehicle licence, but at a rate which would enable commercial operators
to make a commercial return as in the case of road hauliers and bus
operators.
The country would thus be able to experience the alleged benefits of a
competitive environment for rail services at a net cost to the government
not necessarily different from that which is currently paid in support of
British Rail.
