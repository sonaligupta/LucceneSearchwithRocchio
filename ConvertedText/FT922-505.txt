FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HSBC has 74% of Midland


HSBC Holdings, parent of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, had
control of 73.9 per cent of Midland Bank's shares as counting ended of
acceptances received by 1pm Thursday. The bank said that its offer had been
accepted by 54.8 per cent of shareholders in addition to the 19.1 per cent
it already held.
The offer is due to be made wholly unconditional on July 10, with trading in
HSBC's new sterling-denominated shares likely to start at 2.30pm that day.
HSBC is likely to replace Midland in the FT-SE 100 index from July 11.
HSBC corrected yesterday its description of two senior roles created by the
takeover of Midland. Mr Bernard Asher will remain head of the Hongkong
Bank's enlarged capital markets operation based in London. Mr Stephen Green
will continue to oversee the bank's treasury operations and will move from
Hong Kong to London to head the combined treasury operation.
