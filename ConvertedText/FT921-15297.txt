FT  10 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices fall further as glut
fears strengthen


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


OIL PRICES slipped further yesterday as fears of a glut of oil on world
markets gathered strength. North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery
dropped 30 cents to Dollars 16.85 a barrel in a busy market.
'The price is nowhere near a bottom: we could see another couple of dollars
knocked off Brent without blinking,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the
international energy division at Lehman Brothers.
Oil prices had been supported by traders' anticipation of a colder winter
than usual and a continuing slide in exports from the former Soviet Union.
But this has not materialised and demand has been depressed by the slowness
of recovery of western economies.
US meteorologists point out that in North America the weather has been so
mild that it would take temperatures some five degrees below the normal
level for the next six weeks just to reach the seasonal average.
The market was further depressed by the announcement from Vienna that talks
between Iraq and the United Nations had been extended for another day,
heightening fears that some Iraqi oil could return to the market soon.
Many analysts see oil prices staying weak into the second quarter unless the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries institutes some heavy
production cuts. Smaller producers which want emergency action are losing
their voice against the clout of Saudi Arabia.
Countries such as Algeria and Nigeria, which have called for an emergency
meeting, are in the midst of political upheaval that could result in the
replacement of their oil ministers.
