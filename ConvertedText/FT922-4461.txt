FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: GM to sell GMFanuc stake to
partner

   NEW YORK


GENERAL MOTORS is selling its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc Robotics to
Fanuc, the large Japanese robotics company which is its partner in the
10-year-old joint venture.
The deal is the latest example of GM's new strategy of disposing of
peripheral businesses to concentrate on turning around its heavily
loss-making North American automotive operations.
Fanuc said it would be making a cash payment to GM but gave no details.
GMFanuc, which supplies GM and other industrial companies with robotic
systems for painting, welding and other manufacturing techniques, had sales
last year of over Dollars 250m.
It was established in 1982 at a time when Fanuc had little manufacturing
presence in the US and when GM was anxious to bring robotics technology to
its plants.
Fanuc now has several businesses in the US, including a joint venture with
General Electric which produces controllers for machine tools.
GMFanuc's present management will remain in place and the company, which
employs some 670 people, will continue to operate its sales, engineering and
assembly facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
Mr William Hoglund, GM's chief financial officer, said the company intended
to 'maintain our important relationship with GMFanuc as a GM supplier of
plant automation'. The sale is expected to be completed later this year.
In April, GM put up for sale its Allison gas turbine division,which employs
6,300 people and makes turbine engines for the aerospace, industrial and
marine markets.
