FT  20 APR 91 / Briefcase, Q&A: Joint trustees


MY MOTHER died in 1971 and left her estate consisting of shares and property
to me, with my father having a life interest. When my father died the trust
come to an end and everything came to me. My wife and I were trustees, and
everything was registered in our joint names so we did nothing about
transferring anything to my name, thinking it best if everything was held
jointly. Now we have separate taxation and it is more important that
everything is in joint names, is it wise to leave it as it is or should we
execute some document to establish joint ownership, bearing in mind that on
the company register it notes 'as trustees'?
It would be wise to record that you are treating the beneficial interest as
vested in both you and your wife. You can do this by a declaration of trust
made by both you and your wife, reciting that you have held the various
assets (listed in a schedule) on trust for your father for life with
remainder to you, that your father died and that there has been no assent of
the property to you, and declaring that you wish to make a gift to your wife
of half your beneficial interest in the property and that you and your wife
shall henceforth hold the property on trust for the two of you in equal
shares.
