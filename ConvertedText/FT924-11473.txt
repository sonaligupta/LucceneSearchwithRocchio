FT  26 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Tarmac to complete motorway


TARMAC CONSTRUCTION is to start work next month on a Pounds 26m scheme to
build the final section of the M3 motorway in Hampshire. The completion of
the London to Southampton motorway is among new contracts, worth more than
Pounds 35m, won by Tarmac Construction.
The six kilometres of dual three-lane carriageway and nine bridges will
provide the missing motorway link between Bar End, Winchester, and Compton
to complete the strategic route to the north.
The two-year-long scheme includes three motorway junctions and interchanges
at Bar End, Hockley and Shawford, with associated slip roads and four
kilometres of side road diversions.
Fifteen major structures are to be built comprising bridges - two across
rivers and one over a railway track - culverts and retaining walls.
Among the other contracts, refurbishment and repairs, costing Pounds 3.8m,
are to be carried out to tower blocks of flats for Birmingham City Council
by Contracts Housing Division.
A Pounds 1.7m community residential home and workshops for the mentally
handicapped is to be constructed at Rowde, near Devizes in Wiltshire, for
the charity Care (Cottage and Rural Enterprises).
Contract Housing's other new orders include a Pounds 2m refurbishment of
housing at Craigshill in West Lothian for the Livingston Development
Corporation.
