FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&T seeks BT tariff disclosure


   By ANDREW ADONIS


AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph of the US, which is pressing for access to
the UK market, yesterday called for much tougher regulation of British
Telecommunications.
In a submission to the industry regulator Oftel, AT&T said BT should be
forced to publish tariffs for specific services which competitors require to
interconnect with the BT network. BT should also have to publish details of
all relevant costs justifying those tariffs, it said.
This goes far beyond Oftel's draft plans, which would oblige BT to publish
full accounts only for its broad 'retail' and 'network' businesses. AT&T
claimed that 'unbundling' BT's costs for interconnection 'is necessary to
ensure that customers pay only for the services they receive'.
At present competitors have to negotiate the tariff without detailed
knowledge of BT costs. They can appeal to Oftel over unfair treatment.
AT&T, which is awaiting a decision by the Department of Trade and Industry
on its UK move, also criticised BT's control of numbers, directory services
and other structural advantages.
