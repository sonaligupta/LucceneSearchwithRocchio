SWEDEN passed the low point of recession in the first quarter but recovery
will be slow, the Federation of Swedish Industries said yesterday, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm.
It said the weaker krona had given a powerful boost to the competitiveness
of Swedish industry, but warned that both domestic and overseas markets were
weak. It expects GNP to fall 1.7 per cent this year, the third successive
year of economic decline.
It also said unemployment would continue to rise, warning that a further
40,000 jobs could be cut this year.
