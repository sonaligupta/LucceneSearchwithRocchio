FT  11 APR 94 / Pounds 50m revamp for Selfridges store


Sears, the retailing group, is planning to spend Pounds 50m over three years
on its Selfridges department store in London's Oxford Street.
The 450,000 sq ft store has some of the highest sales densities in Europe in
its ground floor cosmetics departments. But average sales per sq ft, at
between Pounds 400 and Pounds 500 a year, are low compared with other Oxford
Street stores.
One problem is that inside the store is an irregularly shaped building which
customers cannot circulate easily. To improve customer flows more than half
the Pounds 50m will be spent on structural changes.
