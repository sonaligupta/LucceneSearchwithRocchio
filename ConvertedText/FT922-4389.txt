FT  05 JUN 92 / Changes in forestry may curb US logging


   By GEORGE GRAHAM


   WASHINGTON


THE US Forest Service is to change its forest management philosophy in a
move that could sharply alter logging practices and help to revive
indigenous tree species almost wiped out by rapidly-growing softwoods.
Mr Dale Robertson, service chief, has instructed regional foresters to start
to manage the 191m acres of national forest under their authority as
'dynamic and complex eco-systems,' instead of concentrating on maximising
timber production.
The new policy is to lead to a 70 per cent reduction in clear-cutting, where
loggers clear an entire area of trees and brush, and to a greater use of
less intensive logging techniques that leave some trees standing.
At the moment, clear-cutting is used on about a third of the 800,000 to
900,000 acres harvested each year in national forests, and accounts for a
much higher proportion of timber volume.
The Forestry Service also aims to restore traditional North American tree
species, including east coast hardwoods and the western ponderosa pine,
which has been largely superseded by faster-growing species such as Douglas
fir and lodgepole pine.
Forestry officials said reduction of clear-cutting would lead to a
short-term drop of about 10 per cent in timber volume harvested, but added
that volumes would return to their previous levels over time.
Stable volumes would imply logging on larger acreages. Some foresters argue
there is ample scope for thinning existing forests.
The exact consequences of the new eco-system in forest management policy are
difficult to predict, especially as it is by no means clear that Mr
Robertson will be allowed to proceed with his policy change by President
George Bush.
