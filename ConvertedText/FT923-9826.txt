FT  03 AUG 92 / Walbrook directors face High Court fight


   By ANDREW JACK


DIRECTORS of Walbrook Insurance, the insurance and re-insurance company
which has net liabilities of Pounds 170m, are expected to fight a last-ditch
attempt in the High Court in London tomorrow to stave off liquidation.
If they fail, Walbrook will pass into the hands of provisional liquidators,
triggering substantial payouts from the Policyholders' Protection Board, the
UK insurance industry safety net, and opening the way for potentially long,
costly and complicated insolvency proceedings.
Walbrook, a subsidiary of London United Investments which is in
administration, was a leading insurer of US liability business in the London
market during the 1980s.
The winding-up petition in the High Court has been brought by Transit
Casualty, a Missouri-based insurance company in receivership since 1985,
which opposed an informal plan proposed by the directors last month.
The directors still have the option of requesting a formal scheme of
arrangement under Section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act, which would allow
them to remain in charge of the company. They are believed to be urging
creditors to attend the court and speak out in favour of the scheme.
Transit has proposed that partners with Cork Gully act as provisional
liquidators. However, their role as liquidators to the Kelm companies,
another part of the LUI group, raises the prospect of a conflict of
interest.
