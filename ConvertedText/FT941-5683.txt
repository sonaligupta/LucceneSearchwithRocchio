FT  04 MAR 94 / Dutch rulers do badly in election


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL


Local elections have dealt a blow to the Netherlands' two ruling parties
ahead of the May general election.
Support for the Christian Democrats (CDA) of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the prime
minister, fell to 25 per cent of the vote on Wednesday from 33.8 per cent in
the last local elections in 1990.
Their coalition partners, Labour, led by Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister,
attracted 20.4 per cent of the vote, down from 26.2 per cent.
According to final results on Wednesday night, the main winners were the two
largest opposition parties, the right-wing Liberals and D66, a centrist
party, as well as a number of smaller parties, including those with
far-right views.
If these results were translated into parliamentary seats, CDA and Labour
would lose their majority in the 150-member lower chamber, with their
combined number of seats falling to 71 from 103 in the 1989 general
election.
This means that if they wished to continue their coalition after the May
election, they would need to bring a third party into government.
However, the local elections are not entirely a reliable guide to future
voting because the results were influenced by local issues and parties that
will not figure in the general elections on May 3.
Mr Kok described the results as a 'serious disappointment'. Labour's
traditional supporters have been angered by the party's agreement to
unpopular reforms of the social welfare system, particularly in the area of
disability insurance.
The CDA was hampered both by the growth in unemployment and by the impending
departure from national politics of Mr Lubbers, whose 12 years in office
make him the longest-serving prime minister in Dutch history.
Another feature of the local elections was the strong showing by far-right
parties which tend to espouse a xenophobic line on immigration and political
asylum.
