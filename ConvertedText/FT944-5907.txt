FT  01 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Private finance


The UK's private finance initiative has so far been characterised by much
noise and little action. The chancellor's claim this week that Pounds 5bn of
contracts would be awarded by the end of 1995 may prove accurate but that is
not saying much: for a start, the figure includes the Pounds 2.7bn Channel
tunnel rail link which is not scheduled to finish until 2002. In the short
term, the most the construction industry can expect from the initiative is a
palliative for the cuts in infrastructure spending announced in the Budget.
Nonetheless, there now seems sufficient political commitment to make a
success of the initiative in the long term. One effect will be to polarise
the construction sector. Companies such as John Laing and Tarmac, which have
strong enough balance sheets to make equity investments, may find the
volatility of their earnings eventually reduced. If they can properly
balance risk with return they should also generate good profits.
Smaller groups will be reduced to participating as minor partners in large
consortia. In theory, their financial weakness should trigger industry
consolidation. However, hostile bids are unlikely because little is publicly
known about the value of construction companies' contracts. Friendly mergers
are also unlikely. Most groups continue to be led by powerful personalities
reluctant to cede control.
