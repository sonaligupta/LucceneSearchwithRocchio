FT  26 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo, Hong Kong and NZ
make headway


   By WAYNE APONTE


   TOKYO


A RALLY in the futures market triggered by a lower than expected earnings
decline for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone pushed the Nikkei average
moderately higher, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 155.60 at 20,631.76, after reaching a session
peak of 20,730.75 and low of 20,482.58. The Topix index of all first section
stocks put on 7.60 at 1,618.29, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was
0.80 up at 1,243.88.
Volume came to 450m shares, compared to Monday's 414m. Advances led declines
by 667 to 361, with 155 issues unchanged.
NTT, the country's largest telecommunications group, announced a 29.5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1992.
But brokers said investors, who had expected a greater drop in earnings for
the last financial year, were encouraged to place buy orders. The shares
finished Y13,000 higher at Y998,000.
Some technical analysts said the Nikkei should stay within a narrow range in
the short term, encountering strong resistance at the 21,000 level. The main
reason for this, they added, was because overseas investors have become net
sellers, arbitrage sales have increased recently and fresh incentives are
scant.
Securities house dealers and individual investors are recognised as the
primary buyers in the market, some brokers said, while financial
institutions, life insurance companies and domestic corporations are still
cautious about equity investment.
Ricoh, a leading office automation equipment maker, and the day's most
active issue, rose Y20 to Y762. Brokers said the company continues to
attract interest after forecasting an increase of 61 per cent in pre-tax
profits for the current fiscal year due to restructuring.
Unicharm, a leading manufacturer of sanitary napkins and paper diapers,
climbed Y70 to Y2,550 on good earnings.
Some banking issues moved into positive territory: Mitsubishi Bank advanced
Y40 to Y2,580, Sumitomo Bank Y40 to Y2,070 and Sakura Bank Y20 to Y1,520.
The shipbuilding sector fell on light profit-taking. Mitsui Engineering and
Shipbuilding lost Y12 to Y465, Mitsubishi Heavy Industry Y14 to Y721 and
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Y2 to Y462.
In Osaka, the OSE average appreciated 66.75 to 22,811.82 in volume of 25m
shares.
