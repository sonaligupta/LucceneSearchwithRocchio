FT  15 APR 94 / Far-right party escapes ban

Germany's right-wing Republican party is becoming increasingly extreme but
members' behaviour has not reached a stage where the party could be banned,
Mr Manfred Kanther, the interior minister, said yesterday. Mr Kanther said
the constitutional court in Karlsruhe would throw out any case on the basis
of existing evidence. Although individual party members were committing
offences, this was not sufficient to ban the party.
The German Communist party was the last party to be banned by the
constitutional court in the 1950s, in a case which lasted five years.
Violent offences by right-wing extremists last year totalled 2,232, 15 per
cent lower than the year before. Seven people died in right-wing violence
last year, according to the annual report by the agency for constitutional
protection. The 23,000 party members have been under observation since
December 1992 in all 16 Lander (states).
