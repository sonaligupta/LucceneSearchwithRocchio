FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Intl Paper registers 33% drop in
earnings


   By MARTIN DICKSON


INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, announced a 33 per
cent drop in fourth-quarter earnings, once special charges are stripped out
of the figures.
The company blamed this mainly on the sluggishness of the US economy and
said it expected difficult business conditions to continue early this year.
Fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars 66m, or 59 cents a share, including
a Dollars 4m after-tax special charge for an accounting change and a Dollars
37m one for severance costs. In the fourth quarter of 1990 earnings totalled
Dollars 23m, or 20 cents a share, after a Dollars 137m charge for a business
improvement plan.
Without the special charges, 1991 fourth-quarter earnings totalled Dollars
107m, compared with Dollars 160m the previous year.
Mr John Georges, chairman, added that sales and earnings in the fourth
quarter 'about equalled second and third-quarter levels as the domestic
economy remained stagnant'.
Full-year earnings totalled Dollars 184m, or Dollars 1.66 a share, after
Dollars 231m of special charges, compared with Dollars 569m, or Dollars 5.21
a share in 1990 after Dollars 137m of special charges.
Sales dipped 2 per cent to Dollars 12.7bn.
Mr Georges said the company's packaging and distribution business reported
stable quarter-to-quarter earnings.
Timber and wood products businesses had higher earnings while domestic
linerboard benefited from increased demand and prices.
