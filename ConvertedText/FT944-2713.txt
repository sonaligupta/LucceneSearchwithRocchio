FT  16 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Rates outlook helps Dow to
build on gains


   By LISA BRANSTEN


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US equities added to Wednesday's gains on speculation that the Federal
Reserve would not raise interest rates next week, writes Lisa Bransten in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.18 higher at 3,765.47.
The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 put on 0.37 at 455.34, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.95 to 426.02 and the Nasdaq
composite advanced 5.01 to 730.68. Trading volume on the New York SE
totalled 337m shares.
A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed December
business activity declining to 28.9 per cent. It was the second month that
the index, derived from a survey of businesses, showed a drop in business
activity.
That news, combined with low inflation figures released on Wednesday, was
enough to persuade the market that the Fed would not increase interest rates
again at the December 20 meeting of its open market committee.
In addition to the change in sentiment, share prices were pushed up by
technical trading and program buying in advance of tomorrow's expiration of
options and futures on stock indices in the last hour of trading.
Morgan Stanley retreated Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 61 after the investment
bank announced that merger talks with SG Warburg had been terminated.
JP Morgan extended the previous day's fall by Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 57 3/8
. The bank said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings would not be as
high as those of the third quarter because of declining trading revenues,
and yesterday an analyst at Goldman Sachs lowered his rating of the
commercial bank from 'market performer' to 'market underperformer'.
Sprint tumbled Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 26 7/8 after the company announced
that it expected fourth-quarter income to be below that of the third
quarter.
General Mills added to gains made on Wednesday afternoon after the company
said it would spin off its restaurant division. In the wake of that
announcement, analysts at two securities firms raised their ratings on the
stock. The stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 57 5/8 yesterday.
Canada
Toronto posted its second straight day of broadly based gains, with only the
gold shares group trailing.
The TSE 300 index ended 32.88 ahead at 4,111.73. Rises outpaced declines by
452 to 293 after volume of 57.7m shares. Golds was the only easier sector,
losing 0.94 per cent in spite of the New York spot bullion price adding
USDollars 1.50 an ounce.
Brazil
The Sao Paulo market fell 2.7 per cent, pulled down by tumbling prices in
the electricity sector as Congress failed to approve a new concessions law.
The Bovespa index finished 1,342 down at 48,426.
Turnover was a robust RDollars 528m, with RDollars 238m seen in options
trading ahead of the expiry day next Monday.
