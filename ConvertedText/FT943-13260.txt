FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hagemeyer in Asian venture with
Swiss group


   By RONALD VAN DE KROL

Hagemeyer, the Dutch-based marketing and distribution group, aims to lift
its presence in the Asia Pacific region through a joint venture with Cosa
Liebermann, a privately-held Swiss company.
The joint venture, HCL, will be based in Hong Kong and may seek a listing on
the Hong Kong stock exchange to underline the company's Asian character and
ease access to Asian capital markets.
The 50:50 joint venture will pool the two companies' combined Asian Pacific
operations in more than 13 countries. Its turnover will total about Fl 1.4bn
(Dollars 809m), with a similar amount likely every year in commission income
through third-party sales.
Hagemeyer, whose activities in Asia are smaller than those of Cosa
Liebermann, will pay Fl 100m to its Swiss partners to make up the difference
in assets. The move will meet Hagemeyer's objective of bolstering its Asian
businesses.
Mr Andrew Land, Hagemeyer chairman, said the partners had complementary
businesses in Asia, where both are active in the marketing and distribution
of brand-name products.
For Hagemeyer, which is 50.3 per cent owned by First Pacific of Hong Kong,
the deal is partly a response to the loss in January of its role as an agent
for Matsushita products in Singapore. The decision by Matsushita, the
Japanese electronics group, to do its own Singapore distribution led to a
halving of Hagemeyer's Asian turnover of roughly Fl 800m per year.
However, the termination of the Matsushita contract produced an
extraordinary gain of nearly Fl 80m for Hagemeyer. The company said
yesterday its first-half results, due to be published on August 24, would
show net profit of about Fl 140m, including the extraordinary gain. This
compares with a net profit of Fl 50.6m in the 1993 first half, when no
extraordinary gains were recorded.
