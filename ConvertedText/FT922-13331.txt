FT  11 APR 92 / Motoring: EC speed limits threat


   By STUART MARSHALL


FORGET national politics. It is the bureaucrats of Brussels who will ensure
that cars such as the Porsche 928GTS may have only a short life span, writes
Stuart Marshall.
These cars will, regrettably, be victims of a pincer movement from speed
limits on the one hand and fuel consumption limits on the other. This
superbly engineered car is the latest  - perhaps the final  - and
unquestionably the best version of the V8 engined 2+2 introduced by this
idiosyncratic manufacturer in 1977.
Outwardly, it has changed little in 15 years. Under its chubby, slant-tailed
hatchback body much is different. The all-aluminium, 32 valve engine has
grown from 4.5 litres to 5.4 litres, its output to 350 horsepower.
The brakes and wheels are bigger, the tyres wider and squatter. The rear
wheels are driven through either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic
transmission combined with the final drive.
At legal speeds on the road, this magnificent machine is only half awake.
Porsche says it will reach 170 mph (275 kmh) and accelerate hard from 125
mph (200 kmh) in high gear. Alas, it does not say where, though it makes the
point that a 928GTS's performance can only be explored fully on a private
racing circuit. It handles superbly, rides with surprising resilience and
feels quite docile until a prod with the right toe lets the wild beast off
its chain.
The mere existence of the 928GTS is a good reason for wanting to be rich. Of
the 30 coming to Britain from the end of this month (at about Pounds
65,000), 15 have been spoken for.
