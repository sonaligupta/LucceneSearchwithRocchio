FT  27 OCT 92 / BP Chemicals trims emissions at main plants


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


WORLDWIDE emissions from British Petroleum Chemicals' 10 largest plants fell
8 per cent from 171,000 tonnes to 158,000 tonnes last year.
The improvement consisted of a better environmental performance of 9,000
tonnes - equivalent to 5 per cent - and a reduction of 4,000 tonnes from
improved data collection and measurement.
The plants represented 80 per cent of BP Chemicals' production and 95 per
cent of its emissions. Figures for BP Oil and BP Explorations were not
given; nor were they given for individual sites.
The result was in spite of an rise in sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions to the air. Sulphur oxide emissions increased 11 per cent to
25,000 tonnes while nitrogen oxide rose 4 per cent to 12,137 tonnes.
Mr Mike LaGraff, manager for health, safety and the environment, said those
increases were because of higher production levels at a power plant located
in Baglan Bay, Wales.
Hydrocarbon emissions fell 16 per cent to 27,000 tonnes, which put the
company on target to reach its aim of halving them by 1997, Mr LaGraff said.
Water emissions remained static at 23,000 tonnes, although the group stayed
on target to cut those by two thirds by 1997. He said water treatment plants
would take time to build. Offsite disposal also fell 5.5 per cent.
The company said carbon dioxide emissions had fallen slightly, but it gave
no details.
Mr LaGraff said the figures would be published next year, together with data
on environmental running costs and expenditure on research and development.
Information on BP Chemicals' failure to comply with regulations would also
be provided.
The group is spending Pounds 100m a year on capital projects for
environmental protection over the next five years, although Mr LaGraff said
that towards 1997 expenditure might slow.
