FT  22 OCT 92 / California given top quake warning

THE CALIFORNIA Office of Emergency Services has issued its first-ever 'Grade
A' earthquake warning, its highest grade of alert.
The office said late on Tuesday there was a significant likelihood that an
earthquake rated six on the Richter scale would occur on the San Andreas
Fault near Parkfield within 72 hours.
Parkfield is a hamlet in the hills overlooking the west side of the San
Joaqun Valley in central California, about 170 miles south-east of San
Francisco.
It has a population of fewer than 100 people but claims to be 'the
earthquake capital of the world'.
Although its reputation was somewhat dented by the deadly Loma Prieta quake
that shook northern California in 1989, the town has a long history of a big
quake about once every 22 years.
The last was in 1966, so the next is overdue.
Parkfield is the site of the world's largest experiment in earthquake
prediction. A 25-kilometre segment of the fault there bristles with Dollars
19m worth of monitoring equipment installed by the US Geological Survey and
geologists from several universities.
In 1985, the USGS issued its first earthquake prediction, saying there was a
95 per cent chance that a quake rated six on the Richter scale would occur
before 1993 near Parkfield.
On Monday night, Parkfield was shaken by a quake of 4.7 on the scale. USGS
seismologists believe this may be the precursor of a more powerful tremor.
The USGS says its instruments point to a 15 per cent chance of a significant
earthquake in the area during the 48 hours from yesterday afternoon.
Such an event could provide scientists with invaluable clues on how to
predict earthquakes reliably.
