FT  22 JUL 94 / Foreign groups create record total of jobs


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Overseas companies created a record 28,727 jobs in the UK last year through
inward investment projects and helped safeguard a further 67,372 jobs, Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday.
The new jobs total is up 40 per cent on 1992-93, while the number of inward
investment projects - new or expanded operations and acquisitions - rose 25
per cent to a record 404, the annual report of the Invest in Britain Bureau
shows.
The report was viewed by the government as further confirmation that the UK
continues to welcome more overseas companies than any other European country
in spite of increasing competition from the rest of the European Union.
Mr Heseltine said: 'These are tremendous figures. Thousands of people are at
work today because of our success at attracting inward investment. But we
will not rest on our laurels. We will need to keep on fighting for every
project.'
The number of jobs created or safeguarded by inward investment was 96,099,
up sharply from 59,271 in the previous year. But officials pointed out that
about 30,000 of the 67,372 saved jobs were linked to BMW's takeover of
Rover.
The report says foreign-owned enterprises account for 17 per cent of all UK
manufacturing jobs, 23 per cent of net output and 33 per cent of net capital
spending.
Among new investments last year was the Pounds 15m spent by Fujitsu Fulcrum
Communications, which makes fibre-optic transmission equipment, on a
European headquarters at Birmingham Business Park. There was also Pounds
3.5m spent on a European headquarters at Gillingham Business Park, Kent, for
Hochiki, a Japanese producer of fire-detection systems.
Nearly half - 183 - of the 404 investment projects, were made by US
companies, up from 126 in the previous year. Investments by German companies
slipped from 51 to 45, while Japanese projects rose from 21 to 30.
The bureau said that of the new jobs, 19,834 were created from 299 projects
in manufacturing - a reflection of the near 40 per cent rise in
manufacturing productivity since 1985.
The latest results were presented yesterday by Mr Andrew Fraser, who took
over as the bureau's chief executive on July 4 after a career spent mainly
in advertising. The appointment was one of a series of initiatives being
taken by Mr Heseltine to reinforce the inward investment effort.
Mr Fraser said all regions of the UK had benefited from inward investment
last year, with many different industry sectors. He said foreign companies
knew that the UK was a good place from which to do business and to take
advantage of the market offered by 370m consumers in the European Economic
Area.
