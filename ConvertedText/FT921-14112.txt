FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India decides to import wheat


   By KK SHARMA


   NEW DELHI


THE INDIAN government decided yesterday to import 1m tonnes of wheat to
bring down the price of the grain in the open market.
Wheat prices have been rising in India despite releases from the official
stocks for the public distribution system. This is thought to be because
farmers and distributors have been hoarding stocks.
The surprise decision was taken by the cabinet committee on prices and will
mean that India, which is a surplus grain producer, will become an importer
again after many years.
India has substantial stocks of wheat, thought to be over 5m tonnes. This
figure is bound to increase with the harvesting of the winter grain crop,
which is expected to be bumper one.
The import plan highlights the determination of the government to check
inflation, running now at 14 per cent.
