FT  28 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Leaner times ahead for car
thieves


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


German car thieves look set for leaner times with the introduction of
equipment to immobilise cars and so prevent them being stolen.
Minitronic/SET of Freising has introduced a radio-based system which does
not need a battery to power it. Cars protected by Car-Protect have a small
transponder integrated into the car key and a reader mounted out of sight
near the steering column. When the key is inserted into the ignition a radio
signal transmits a 20-digit code to the reader, where it is compared with
the stored code. Only if the codes match will the ignition start.
Car-Protect uses a transponder from Texas Instruments. The reader sends an
electrical pulse out when the key is inserted and this is picked up by the
transponder in the key to activate the system. Minitronic: Germany, 81 61
925 77.
