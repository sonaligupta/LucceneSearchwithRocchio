FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Moving house


The abrupt departure of Mike Whitehouse, 47-year-old operations director of
the Halifax, is yet another sign that the top management of Britain's
biggest building society is in a state of flux. Whitehouse, who has been
with the society for nearly 30 years, was one of the younger generation of
Halifax executives in the running to take over from group chief executive
Jim Birrell who steps down next August.
With Whitehouse off the scene, the internal front-runners to follow Birrell
are finance director Graham Folwell and Derek Taylor, managing director of
the estate agencies. Both are in their 50s. However, it looks likely that
the Halifax is going to recruit Birrell's replacement from outside.
One name which keeps on recurring is that of Andrew Longhurst, the
aggressive boss of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. He would
make sure that the Halifax remains number one.
