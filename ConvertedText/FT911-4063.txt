FT  22 APR 91 / Venezuelans pick telecom contenders


   By JOE MANN


VENEZUELA has picked eight international companies to tender for the
privatisation of the state-owned telephone company, CANTV, writes Joe Mann.
They are: Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, Bell Canada, France Telecom, GTE, Nippon
Telephone & Telegraph, Southwestern Bell and US West.
The government wants an international company to take over CANTV operations
and install around 300,000 new telephone lines a year. This would require
annual investments estimated at Dollars 800m.
