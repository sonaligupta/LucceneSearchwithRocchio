FT  30 JUN 93 / Management: A boost for word power


   By ALAN CANE


A technique used by many of the world's largest companies to help executives
write simple, informative reports and memos is now available in the UK.
'Information mapping' is based on research carried out at Harvard and
Columbia Universities. It uses principles of information analysis and
management which are instinctive to naturally fluent writers, but which can
be learned.
Examples are:
The use of 'bullet points', or short, clear statements taken from the main
text, to ram home the essential elements of an argument.
Ways of splitting dense text into fact-rich chunks which can be easily
assimilated.
Obvious enough, perhaps, but anyone who has struggled to comprehend a
detailed technical report will understand the importance of helping the
message pass efficiently from writer to reader.
Information mapping's arrival in the UK is the result of an agreement
between the Danish company Information Mapping Europe (IME) and TMS Computer
Authors, a small Godalming, Surrey-based organisation specialising in
documentation and training. With a capital injection of Pounds 450,000 from
the 3i group, last year it turned over Pounds 3.5m.
Jean Hilder, a director of Computer Authors, points out that managers read
on average 1m words a week and forget 80 per cent of what they have learned
within a month.
Companies that have used information mapping report significant benefits: a
38 per increase in the use of documentation by its recipients, 30 per cent
decrease in reading time and 55 per cent fewer errors. Among IME's clients
are AT&T, Digital Equipment, Dow Chemical, IBM and Sun Life of Canada.
Computer Authors is planning public seminars on information mapping at
Pounds 750 plus VAT per person or seminars for up to 15 people at Pounds
5,000 plus VAT.
