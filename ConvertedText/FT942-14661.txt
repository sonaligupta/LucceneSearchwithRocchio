FT  19 APR 94 / International Company News: Citic Pacific in HK3.82bn share
issue to fund expansion

   HONG KONG


Citic Pacific, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Beijing investment company,
has issued HKDollars 3.82bn (USDollars 492.3m) worth of new shares to fund a
series of tunnel and property acquisitions and to provide a treasure chest
for further capital expenditure.
The acquisitions are to be injected into Citic Pacific from parent Citic HK
under a series of share asset swaps, which sees the Hong Kong listed arm
raise its stake in the Western Harbour Crossing, one of the most important
projects in the new airport programme, to 35 per cent from 10 per cent. It
also takes strategic stakes in the Eastern Harbour Crossing and the Shanghai
Tunnel.
The Western Harbour Crossing is scheduled for completion around mid-1997,
when it is expected to account for an average cross harbour flow of 69,000
vehicles a day, increasing to 160,000 by the year 2023. The total budgeted
project cost is HKDollars 7.5bn.
Two Hong Kong properties, one luxury residential and one industrial, are
also being switched into Citic Pacific, both at prices which represent a 10
per cent discount to market valuations calculated by independent valuers.
The new shares represent around 8.25 per cent of the enlarged issued share
capital of Citic Pacific. They were issued at HKDollars 23, representing a
discount of around 3.36 per cent to the closing price on Friday when the
transaction was completed.
Following the deal, Citic HK marginally loosens its grip on the Hong Kong
listed arm, down to 42.78 per cent from 43.04 per cent.
Of the new Citic Pacific shares, 66m will be swapped with Citic HK and a
further tranche of 100m, worth HKDollars 2.3bn, will be used for capital
expenditure and to pay down debts.
Directors of Citic Pacific also said they had shelved plans to spin off Dah
Chong Hong Holdings, the motor distributor.
