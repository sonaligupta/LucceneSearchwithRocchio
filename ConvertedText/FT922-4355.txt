FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott wins leadership campaign
boost


Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, yesterday won an important
boost to his bid for Labour's deputy leadership when UCATT, the construction
union, gave his candidacy a ringing endorsement.
After all three contenders had spoken to the union's annual conference in
Southport, Mr Prescott won 70 per cent of the final vote against 15 per cent
each for his rivals, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr Bryan Gould.
For the leadership itself, the left-leaning union, representing some 2.3 per
cent of the union votes in Labour's electoral college, favoured Mr Gould
over Mr John Smith by 52 points to 48.
