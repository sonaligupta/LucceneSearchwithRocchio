FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Linde turns in 3.1% advance at
half-time

   FRANKFURT


LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, yesterday reported a 3.1
per cent rise in pre-tax profits during the first half of 1992 to DM243m
(Dollars 152m) and said it expected another satisfactory result for the full
year.
Group turnover during the period rose by 12.5 per cent to DM3.5bn and Linde
said the figure for all of 1992 should be at least 10 per cent higher than
in 1991. Orders were up by 7.2 per cent to DM3.7bn, with the backlog at the
end of June totalling DM5.8bn, 11 per cent above the level at the start of
the year.
In the group's biggest division, materials handling, turnover eased by 1.4
per cent in the first half to DM1.55bn. Linde said domestic demand remained
strong, but some foreign markets weakened.
The company has announced plans to buy control of an Italian company in this
sector, Fiat OM Carrelli Elevatori, which has a turnover of DM319m and
employs 1,150 people.
Linde's industrial plant operation registered a 29 per cent rise in turnover
to DM516m, despite weak investment activity in the chemical and
petrochemical sectors. Sales of refrigeration systems were 13 per cent
higher at DM408m, with a 36 per cent jump in industrial gas turnover to
DM983m, partly reflecting the purchase of a majority stake in Hoek Loos, a
Dutch gas company.
Linde said its investments this year would be about DM800m compared with
DM711m in 1991.
HAKO, the electronics retailer, lost DM13.9m in the first half of 1992,
compared with a loss of DM22m in the previous corresponding half, Reuter
reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Hans Kompernass, management board chairman, said the loss from operations
and restructuring measures was DM12.7m. The remaining loss came from
write-downs in the value of shares and dollars held.
