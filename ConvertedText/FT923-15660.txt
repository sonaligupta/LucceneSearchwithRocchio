FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Alcoa cuts 2,100 jobs worldwide

THE Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
producer, is cutting 2,100 jobs from its worldwide workforce.
It will take an after-tax charge of Dollars 40.6m, or 48 cents per share, on
its second-quarter results to cover severance costs.
The company has been struggling against a deteriorating aluminium market and
said it was reducing its workforce to improve competitiveness. The cuts will
include hourly-paid workers as well as salaried employees.
The low price of aluminium battered the company's results during 1991 and
the first quarter of 1992. Last year, Alcoa's net income fell 79 per cent to
Dollars 62.7m compared with Dollars 295.2m in 1990, and its first-quarter
1992 results were down 22 per cent to Dollars 76m against Dollars 97m in the
year-earlier period.
Aluminium products account for between two-thirds and three-quarters of
revenues.
Trying to soften the blow to its 65,000 strong workforce, the company said
it would help minimise the cuts through attrition, transfers and early
retirements. It will also reduce the number of jobs filled by outside
contractors.
Alcoa warned earlier this year that it was reviewing operations and that
this would result in job reductions.
