FT  11 APR 92 / International Company News: Sabena signs partnership accord
with Air France

   BRUSSELS


SABENA, the Belgian state airline, yesterday signed a partnership deal with
Air France, and forecast its profit would increase by 1995 to BFr4.48bn
(Dollars 133.3m) before preference dividends. Its debt would come down to 87
per cent of own funds, the carrier said.
Mr Pierre Godfroid, the Sabena chairman, said the airline was 'like a
phoenix rising from its ashes'. In 1991 the group made an operating profit
of BFr2.13bn after a 1990 loss of BFr7.15bn.
The Sabena-Air France link, which will also lead to close commercial and
management co-operation, was cleared by the Belgian government last week,
after months of frustrating delay while a new coalition government was being
formed in Belgium.
The link will involve Air France and its Belgian financial partners
injecting BFr6bn into Sabena and taking a 37.5 per cent stake. The Belgian
government, which has already provided substantial funds, will add a further
BFr9bn.
Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, and Mr Guy Coeme, Belgian
transport minister, both welcomed the deal.
The business plan for Sabena envisages turnover increasing from BFr54bn this
year to BFr67bn by 1995, and a profit of BFr414m in 1992, with sharp
increases in the next three years.
Mr Coeme yesterday tried to defuse the inevitable political controversy in
Belgian about the French participation. Some Flemish politicians believe it
will upset Sabena's linguistic balance.
