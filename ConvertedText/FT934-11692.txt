FT  29 OCT 93 / Western banks get guarantee in gold


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


UZBEKISTAN has shipped Dollars 400m worth of gold to French, Swiss and US
banks to 'serve as guarantees for those who want to invest in our country',
Mr Islam Karimov, the republic's president, told French businessmen
yesterday.
The president of Uzbekistan, which is an important gold producer, raised
eyebrows when he told French businessmen that any doubters about the worth
of this guarantee could check his country's bullion in the vaults of Credit
Commercial de France (CCF) in Paris.
He gave the initial impression that he had brought the gold in his personal
baggage on his state visit to Paris. But CCF later said that the gold, which
it described as an amount of 'some consequence', had been sent to Paris a
short time ago in the usual manner of such shipments.
Other French banks appeared mildly piqued at learning that the CCF now has
the collateral of gold to cover credit for Uzbekistan which they do not. But
Mr Charles de Croisset, CCF's president, said that by depositing the gold in
CCF the Uzbek president clearly had no intention of conferring on CCF 'any
monopoly'. The deposit, Mr de Croisset said, was rather 'a symbol to show
that Uzbekistan is a serious economic partner for the world'.
Mr Karimov complained about the 'diktats' of the Russian central bank in
running the rouble zone of which Uzbekistan is still part. If this
continued, he said, Uzbekistan might set up its own gold-backed national
currency, on whose feasibility it had already consulted the Deutsche Bank.
