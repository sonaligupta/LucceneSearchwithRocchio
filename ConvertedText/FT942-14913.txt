FT  18 APR 94 / Survey of Singapore (4): Economic growth surprises the
forecasters


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL


Singapore, as a newly industrialised economy, had schooled itself to expect
slower, steadier growth than in the heady, early days of its development.
Last year, however, the economy confounded the forecasters and this year it
may do so again.
The 1993 growth rate of 9.9 per cent was well above both the previous year's
6 per cent and the government's long-term targeted range of 4 to 6 per cent.
For 1994, the government is forecasting growth of 6 to 8 per cent.
Manufacturing industry grew by 9.8 per cent, mainly because of strong demand
for electronic products such as disk drives, telecommunications equipment,
semiconductors and printed circuit boards.
A sharp increase in stock market trading, combined with expansion of foreign
exchange dealing, domestic lending and Singapore-based international
banking, brought a big increase in the contribution of financial services to
growth, too.
When this performance is combined with low inflation, a strong currency,
fiscal surplus, productivity growth exceeding real wage growth, and buoyant
export markets in the US and Asia, the economic picture is extraordinarily
rosy.
Not that the island's leaders are complacent about the prospects. Singapore
has no resources except its population - even water is imported. The
government is, therefore, paying considerable attention to ensuring that its
people have the right qualifications to push an already industrialised and
well-off country further forward.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, noted in his February budget speech that
Singapore had the least educated workforce of any of its near rivals in
Asia, with only 54 per cent of the labour force having at least secondary
school education compared with more than 70 per cent in Hong Kong, Taiwan
and South Korea.
Moreover, he pointed out, the economic structure is very much that of a
developing country - 'we depend heavily on foreign technology.' Research and
development spending was well below that in Taiwan and Korea, and very few
Singaporean companies ranked as world-class, he said.
The government itself may be to blame for this. Its emphasis on
government-led planning and the dominance of state-controlled companies has
tended to stifle entrepreneurship.
Many of the products of Singapore's manufacturing industry are likely, too,
to have a fairly short cycle before they are replaced by newer technology.
The aim must always be to be competitive for the next wave of products. To
this end, the Economic Development Board last year invested in a
semiconductor wafer fabrication plant in partnership with three foreign
companies.
Improvement of educational standards, creation of more dynamic companies -
partly through privatisation - and encouragement of high-technology
investment are all part of the government's long-term programme to keep
Singapore competitive and advance it to what it calls the 'First League.'
At the same time, it is seeking to prevent greater affluence from
stimulating popular demand for increased provision of government services
such as care for the elderly. 'We must avoid the pifalls of welfarism which,
as the experience of socialist and western democratic governments has shown,
sooner or later leads to dependency and destruction of the work ethic,' Mr
Hu said in his budget speech.
In the shorter term, there are a number of economic question marks:
First, the introduction of a 3 per cent value added tax from the beginning
of this month is likely to depress consumer spending, though most economists
believe the effect will only be temporary. It will cause a one-time increase
in inflation, though probably of less than 3 percentage points. The
government has reduced other taxes to offset the impact and has guaranteed
to keep the VAT rate at 3 per cent for at least five years.
Second, interest rates began to creep upwards even before the US Federal
Reserve began to tighten credit earlier this year and are generally expected
to rise further during the year. Since Singapore's anti-inflation policy
depends on maintaining a firm exchange rate against the US dollar, local
interest rates are likely to rise further this year.
Third, residential property prices have been rising too fast for the comfort
of some economists.
Fourth, a fall this year in the stock market - in line with the general
correction in south-east Asian markets after last year's strong gains - is
likely to reduce the contribution made by financial services to economic
growth this year.
Growth of manufacturing industry is likely to remain closely linked to
demand in important export markets, particularly the US. Tourism has also
shown healthy growth, although the government worries that visitors may
increasingly treat Singapore as a stop-over between Asian destinations.
The government is mindful of the short-term challenges as well as the
longer-term questions over Singapore's competitiveness. It knows that
continued prosperity depends on staying ahead of other regional economies in
attracting foreign investment and trade.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, summed up the government's continuing
intention to plan ahead when he said in his budget speech: 'Singaporeans
must not be lulled into thinking that we have arrived, and start relaxing
and taking progress and prosperity for granted.'
