FT  19 MAY 92 / Whitbread profits fall 24% at year-end as bad debts bite


   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE


WHITBREAD's pre-tax profits tumbled 24 per cent to Pounds 222.1m last year
as the brewing and retail group was exposed to the full blast of the
recession in south-east England.
More than half the fall in profits - the first since 1976 - was accounted
for by a Pounds 37m exceptional charge against bad and doubtful debts among
the group's free-trade loans.
Trading profit during the year to February 29 was 7 per cent lower at Pounds
227.7m on turnover up 6 per cent to Pounds 2.19bn.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 32.6m includes the disposal of the
European Pizza Hut operations.
Earnings per share fell 24 per cent to 35.78p. A final dividend of 12.4p,
against 12p a year earlier, lifts the full-year payment 4 per cent to
16.95p.
Mr Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said yesterday trading performance had
been stronger than the results indicated. There had been no recovery yet in
restaurants and hotels but managed pub business was ahead.
'I am very optimistic about our prospects when consumer confidence returns,'
Mr Jarvis added.
Whitbread's beer division slightly increased its share of the total beer
market to 13.2 per cent. Operating profits rose 2 per cent to Pounds 67.6m
on turnover 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 889.4m. Sales of Boddingtons bitter
have doubled since the group acquired the brand in 1989 and Murphy's Irish
stout achieved retail sales of Pounds 70m in its second year of national
distribution.
Reorganisation of the tenanted pub estate, including the sale of 500 pubs,
led to a 3 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 63.9m on turnover of Pounds
241.3m, 12 per cent lower.
Almost 1,500 tenanted pubs have been converted to 20-year tied leases with
average rent increases of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.
Profits from managed retail operations fell 8 per cent to Pounds 119.9m on
turnover that increased from Pounds 1.24bn to Pounds 1.38bn. Whitbread Inns
maintained liquor sales, in spite of a 7 per cent drop in market volumes,
and food sales rose 11 per cent.
Beefeater profits rose 18 per cent and Pizza Hut maintained leadership of
the pizza market with a 33 per cent share. TGI Friday sales grew 24 per
cent. Travel Inn achieved occupancy rates of more than 80 per cent.
