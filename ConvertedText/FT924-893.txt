AT LEAST 54 people were killed when a DC-10 carrying 327 Dutch holidaymakers
and 13 crew to Portugal crashed while trying to land in heavy rain and winds
at the Algarve town of Faro.
The aircraft, operated by Martinair, a charter airline partly owned by KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines and the Dutch transport group Nedlloyd, burst into
flames and broke in two on impact.
Airport officials in Faro, the main city of Portugal's Algarve coastal
region, said 54 people were known to have died, while 124 were injured.
Most of the people on board were Dutch nationals.
In Amsterdam, airline officials said the cause of the crash was not known.
First reports suggested the aircraft had been hit by lightning. The pilot is
reported to have survived.
The 'black box' containing flight data has been located and will be examined
by Portuguese and Dutch investigators. Passengers interviewed by Dutch
television said the pilot had made two attempts to land before the fatal
approach.
