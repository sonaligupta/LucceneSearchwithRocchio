The Pelican Group, the USM-quoted restaurant operator, reported an 84 per

At the pre-tax level, profits fell by 50 per cent from Pounds 263,000 to

chairman, said that Pelican now had 14 restaurants and intended to open a
further six Cafe Rouge outlets by the spring, thereby doubling the total.
Earnings per share declined to 1.1p (3.9p).
