FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: ADT falls 44% in line with City forecasts


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


ADT, the Bermuda-based security and car auction company, yesterday reported
a 44 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for 1991, broadly in line with market
expectations.
Pre-tax profits fell to Dollars 137m (Pounds 79m) against Dollars 244m on
sales up 9 per cent at Dollars 1.25bn. Earnings per share fell from Dollars
1.93 to Dollars 1.04.
The company repeated its statement that it would not pay an ordinary
dividend until the 1992 results at the earliest in line with the policy of
reducing debt.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman, forecast that earnings per share would
increase in 1992. 'Not many UK companies would go out on a limb and say
that,' he said.
Regarding ADT's convertible preference shares which fall due in 1994, Mr
Ashcroft said: 'The last quarter of 1994 is two and a half years away, we do
not see it as a problem.'
The pre-tax figure was again boosted by profits from foreign exchange gains
of Dollars 20m, down from last year's Dollars 27m. The gain from long term
investments fell from Dollars 22.7m to Dollars 11.6m, including losses on
the sale of stakes in Christies International and Quoteplan.
The figures included a Dollars 57.9m charge above the line, most of which
was due to interest as debt rose as the group crystallised losses on
associate investments.
Debt finished the year at Dollars 1.04bn, down from Dollars 1.1bn, but Mr
Ashcroft said that taking away the value of quoted investments and liquid
assets, gearing at the year-end would be about 100 per cent on shareholders'
equity of Dollars 600m.
At the operating level, profits from security services fell slightly, from
Dollars 133m to Dollars 131m, while auctions increased profits from Dollars
64.3m to Dollars 71.8m.
