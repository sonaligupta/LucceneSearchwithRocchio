FT  29 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome weak


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome continued to under-perform the market and the
rest of the health and household sector, ahead of the challenge in the US
courts by two companies to Wellcome's patent on its anti-Aids drug AZT, or
Retrovir.
The court case, being heard in New Bern North Carolina and brought by two
generic drug manufacturers, Barr and Novopharm, is expected to last around
two to three weeks.
Although some analysts expect Wellcome to win the case, its shares are
expected to come under fire as bouts of uncertainty unnerve some
institutional holders of the stock.
US newspaper reports concerning AZT treatment also added to the general air
of uncertainty surrounding Wellcome. The latter's shares, down 4.5 per cent
last week, fell to 684p yesterday before stabilising and closing a net 9 off
at 688p. Turnover was an unremarkable level of 1.3m.
