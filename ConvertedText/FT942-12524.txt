FT  29 APR 94 / Halifax raises fixed-interest rates


Halifax, the largest building society, yesterday raised interest rates on
its fixed-rate investment accounts, offering further evidence of the impact
of long-term money market rates. A saver with Pounds 10,000 will earn 7.15
per cent gross for a three-year fixed term instead of 6.85 per cent.
Nationwide, the second-largest society, has issued a new range of fixed-rate
mortgages which are on average 0.4 of a percentage point higher than those
withdrawn.
