FT  05 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities retreat on
sporadic profit-taking

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US STOCK markets snapped a five-day winning streak yesterday as prices
tended to ease amid occasional profit-taking, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 11.08 down at 3,384.32. The Standard
& Poor's 500 lost only 0.73 at 424.36, while the Nasdaq composite shed 1.04
to 581.32. Turnover on the New York SE was again light, at 167m shares.
After five days in which the Dow had added more than 110 points, yesterday's
mild correction was not unexpected. In the absence of important economic
news (the day's only data, a 0.2 per cent decline in July leading economic
indicators, was in line with expectations), and with no lead from the bond
market, share prices turned softer on a lack of buying and sporadic
profit-taking.
Trading was also subdued by a reluctance among investors to take large
positions ahead of Friday's employment report for July, which should give
the latest reading on the conditions in the job market and which might, if
sufficiently weak, produce another easing of monetary policy by the Federal
Reserve. Analysts are expecting the job figures to show a 110,000 rise in
non-farm payrolls and a slight decline in national unemployment to 7.7 per
cent.
Monsanto jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 56 1/2 in turnover of 1.5m shares
after announcing the sale of its Fisher Control International unit to
electronic products group Emerson Electric in a deal valued at Dollars
1.275bn. After the announcement, broking house Kidder Peabody upgraded its
rating on Monsanto from 'hold' to 'buy'. The news of the deal left Emerson
Dollars 1 1/8 lower at Dollars 50.
Harris Corp rose Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 31 3/8 on fiscal fourth-quarter
net income from continuing operations of 87 cents a share, up from the 69
cents earned at the same stage a year ago. Thiokol was also boosted by
higher quarterly earnings, putting on Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 15 7/8 .
Going the other way on quarterly figures was Houston Industries, down
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 46 1/8 on news of the 60 cents a share earned during
the April-June period, down slightly from a year earlier.
Bethlehem Steel was one of the most active stocks, dipping Dollars  1/4 to
Dollars 13 3/8 in turnover of 1.9m shares after the steel group's 12m-share
stock offering began trading yesterday.
On the Nasdaq market, Heart Technology fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 3/4
after posting a second quarter loss of 34 cents a share, against a 6 cents a
share shortfall a year ago. Scios lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 10 after
analysts warned that drug group Pfizer may not pursue its collaboration with
Scios on a diabetes drug after the end of the year.

TORONTO share prices spent a quiet session in negative territory. The TSE
300 index retreated 17.4 to 3,426.0 and losing issues led gains by 292 to
211 after volume of 18.5m shares. The market was closed on Monday for a
holiday.
The gold shares group posted the day's largest fall, losing 2.36 per cent.
The New York gold price, although slightly higher yesterday, fell nearly
USDollars 5 an ounce on Monday.
Canadian Pacific reported lower second quarter earnings, and a six-month
loss compared to year-earlier net income, but gained CDollars  1/4 to
CDollars 17 1/2 .
Canfor, up CDollars  1/2 at CDollars 28, announced a significant reduction
in its second quarter and six-month losses.
Mitel shot to the top of the actives list, with the shares climbing to a
52-week high of CDollars 2.72 before ending 9 cents up at CDollars 2.56 on
volume of 856,000 shares. The company released its earnings for the first
quarter shortly after the close.
