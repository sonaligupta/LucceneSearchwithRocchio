FT  16 MAR 94 / Benefit split could lift women's income


Social security reforms could raise women's incomes at little cost to the
Exchequer and without discouraging women from taking up work, the Institute
for Fiscal Studies, the independent think-tank, says in a study published
yesterday.
The study, conducted for the Equal Opportunities Commission, examines
several proposals. It estimates that one proposal, splitting income support
payments equally between partners, would not increase government spending on
benefits but would give two-thirds of women with children in unemployed
couples a gain of more than Pounds 10 a week.
IFS programme director Mr Steven Webb said: 'Our research shows that
carefully constructed reforms can increase women's financial independence
and have little disincentive effects on part-time work.'
But the study warns against simply increasing social security benefits. It
says that introducing a new 'non-worker's benefit', for example, of Pounds
25 per week for all individuals including married women not in paid
employment would cost up to Pounds 7bn and encourage some women to give up
their existing low-paid part-time work.
