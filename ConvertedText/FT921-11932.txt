FT  29 JAN 92 / Disclosures on boardroom pay


BRITAIN'S largest companies have begun to disclose more information about
boardroom pay in annual reports, but many need to be more open, according to
Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration advisers, which today
launches a set of guidelines for directors' pay disclosure.
Over the past two years the proportion of Britain's largest companies
disclosing more than the statutory minimum about boardroom pay has increased
from about 30 per cent to more than 50 per cent, the guidelines say.
