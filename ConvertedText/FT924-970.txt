FT  21 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Restoring infrastructure in Kuwait


As part of the Kuwait reconstruction programme following the Gulf War,
UNITED GULF CONSTRUCTION (UGC) has been awarded what is believed to be the
largest ever microtunnelling project in the Middle East, and probably the
world.
The UGC contract, worth in excess of Pounds 1m, comprises more than 70km of
sewer pipe and pipe refurbishment of which about 4.5km will be constructed
with the aid of Iseki microtunnelling systems.
The works, designed by Associated Consulting Engineers of Athens, Greece,
mark the start of the rebuilding of Kuwait's underground infrastructure.
The company is purchasing three Unclemole slurry-shield microtunnelling
systems from Euro Iseki of Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Approximately 40
per cent of the microtunnelling work will be to install 250mm id sewers.
Specially designed clayware jacking pipes for the sewer are being
manufactured and supplied by Naylor Bros. (Clayware) from the Denlok range.
Work has commenced on the project, and will be subject to a continuous
programme of method assessment. The Iseki packages and Naylor Denlok pipes
will be delivered next January.
