FT  12 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pharmakopius flotation postponed


   By DAVID WIGHTON


The planned flotation of Pharmakopius International has been postponed
because of 'volatility' in the biotechnology sector.
Originally planned for February 16, the flotation had already been pushed
back and yesterday the company admitted it had been shelved 'for the time
being'.
It insisted that the decision did not reflect lack of interest in
Pharmakopius itself from potential investors. 'The interest is there, but a
number of institutions are getting nervous about the sector.'
It pointed to the recent flotation of Chiroscience, a biotechnology company
whose Pounds 100m valuation was criticised as too high by some analysts.
But at 147p Chiroscience's shares are only 3p below the issue price, and
other shares in the sector, notably British Bio-technology, have performed
well in recent weeks.
The company scotched rumours that it had failed to meet the Stock Exchange
requirements for a listing. Unlike many biotechnology companies Pharmakopius
has a profitable trading record.
