FT  21 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Spain secures Kuwaiti support for Torras
firms


   By REUTER


   KUWAIT


SPAIN has secured commitments from Kuwait to ensure the emirate's
disinvestment from Spain does not cause the collapse of companies there,
Reuter reports from Kuwait.
Secretary of state for economy Mr Pedro Perez held talks in Kuwait with top
government officials after Kuwait's Spanish holding company Grupo Torras
went into receivership last week citing losses of over Dollars 4bn.
He said Kuwait had agreed to secure loans made to companies in which Torras
held shares and to set up a committee to co-ordinate activities of the
various firms.
The official Kuna news agency said the two sides had signed an agreement
aimed at supporting Torras companies.
Spain was anxious that an abrupt withdrawal of Kuwaiti investment could
cripple a number of Torras firms, three of which are already in
receivership.
Mr Perez did not specify how long the Kuwait Investment Authority, parent of
the London-based Kuwait Investment Office, had pledged to secure bank loans
to the companies, or the sums involved.
He added that agreement had been reached to manage for the time being
Torras's 39 per cent owned chemicals group Ercros which suspended payments
in July.
