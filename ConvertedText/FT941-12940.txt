FT  27 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hopes of compromise on
reform lift Nikkei by 2.6%


   By WAYNE LIONEL APONTE


   TOKYO


Equities extended the recovery they began on Tuesday, advancing by 2.6 per
cent as favourable remarks concerning a potential compromise on the
government's political reform measures encouraged buying from futures and
foreign investors in late trading, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average added 489.85 at 19,138.21, after fluctuating between
18,759 and 19,155. The Topix index of all first section issues ended 30.94
higher at 1,550.32.
According to domestic brokers, a vague comment from Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a
leader in the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP), which was interpreted
as supporting the nation's political reform measures, sparked the late
afternoon buying.
Mr Gotoda was reported to have said that he has already decided how to vote
when the measures reach the lower house. Furthermore, about 70 other members
of the LDP have allegedly agreed to vote in favour of the bills, which the
upper house of parliament rejected last week.
Futures-led buy orders entered the market aggressively late in the session,
coupled with foreign purchases, which pushed the Nikkei average to its
intraday high. Foreign investors remained bullish on Japanese equities, but
most domestic players watched cautiously from the sidelines in spite of
available evidence which now suggests otherwise.
Mr Norio Okutsu, manager of futures trading at Nikko Securities, said the
day's gains marked a change in market sentiment, and he expects the buying
to last for the rest of this week.
But, judging from the weak state of the domestic economy, below-average
economic reports and the Bank of Japan's seeming unwillingness to cut the
official discount rate, it was still too early for unbridled optimism.
Volume was estimated at 360m shares, compared with Tuesday's final 281m.
Advances overwhelmed declines by 968 to 114, with 93 issues unchanged. But
in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed 0.01 off at 1,281.11.
On the trading floor, computer equipment makers moved higher in tandem with
the Nikkei average. NEC gained Y21 at Y980, and Fujitsu rose Y15 to Y920.
Steady buying lifted consumer electronic issues. Sony advanced Y100 to
Y5,870, Pioneer Electronic moved Y80 higher to Y2,920 and Victor climbed Y30
to Y934.
Domestic brokers benefited from the day's gains, Nomura Securities rising
Y50 to Y2,090, Nikko Securities Y40 to Y1,230 and Daiwa Securities Y40 to
Y1,490.
In Osaka, the OSE average finished 431.10 ahead at 20,832.32 in volume of
55.7m shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets moved in sharply divergent directions. Australia and
Bombay were closed.
HONG KONG fell 2.2 per cent, pressured by profit-taking and fears over
Sino-British ties, although late demand lifted prices from their lows. The
Hang Seng index was finally down 251.37 at 11,239.57 after touching
11,150.71.
Profit-taking pushed prices lower from the start amid concern over the
future of Sino-British relations after China's warnings on Tuesday that it
will not honour debts or contracts for Hong Kong's new airport after it
takes over in the colony in 1997.
Hutchison Whampoa slipped HKDollars 1.50 to HK40.25 as it denied market
rumours that it planned to spin off part of Hongkong International
Terminals, in which it recently increased its stake.
MANILA dropped 3.4 per cent as the market continued to lack buyers due to
worries over looming oil price and wage rises, and talks between the
government and the International Monetary Fund. The composite index fell
103.83 to 2,985.61.
SEOUL moved ahead for the fourth consecutive day as blue chip shares were
favoured over low-priced counters. The composite index closed 2.28 higher at
894.34.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed a weak early trend to end higher across the board as
the market staged a strong rebound after forced selling had dragged prices
lower.
The composite index gained 17.51, or 1.7 per cent, at 1,029.31 after
touching a low of 967.92 in the morning as forced selling on clients unable
to meet margin calls sent share prices tumbling.
SINGAPORE recouped much of sharp early losses, helped by the rebound in the
Malaysian market. The Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.58 easier at
2,255.47 after plunging more than 2 per cent in morning trade.
TAIWAN finished modestly firmer in turnover that continued to shrink as
trading interest was diminished by the high level of outstanding margin
loans and seasonally high money market interest rates. The weighted index
put on 9.99 at 5,845.50.
BANGKOK staged a moderate rally near the end of a lacklustre session. The
SET index finished 11.54 higher at 1,459.14 in light turnover of Bt11.9bn.
NEW ZEALAND closed firmer in reasonably active trade in spite of the holiday
in Australia. The NZSE-40 capital index was up 3.42 at 2,284.11.
KARACHI finished higher as blue chip stocks posted fresh gains on
institutional support. The KSE 100-share index closed 5.31 ahead at
2,284.88.
