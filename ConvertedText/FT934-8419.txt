FT  16 NOV 93 / Undertakings on price-fixing


A NUMBER of thermal insulation companies yesterday gave undertakings to the
Office of Fair Trading following an investigation into price-fixing
arrangements.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, had brought
proceedings against 15 companies following an investigation which revealed
two price-fixing agreements which ran from 1986 until mid-1988.
In an undefended hearing at the Restrictive Practices Court Sir Bryan
obtained undertakings from some of the companies not to enforce the
agreements and the court made orders against the others.
