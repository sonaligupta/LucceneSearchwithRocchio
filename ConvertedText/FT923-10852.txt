FT  28 JUL 92 / Transport of delight


   By CHRIS TIGHE


Teesside's Transporter Bridge, a marvel of Edwardian engineering, reopened
yesterday after repairs which tested the ingenuity of today's engineers,
Chris Tighe writes.
The bridge was opened in 1911 to link the steelworks and shipyards which
then lined the north bank of the Tees to Middlesbrough on the south bank. It
carries vehicles and passengers on a deck suspended over the water at road
level. The deck is suspended on cables attached to the bridge's overhead
trolley mechanism and the trolley runs on girders supported by 225ft towers
on each bank.
The bridge was closed for the repairs In March 1990 after an axle pin
sheared, sending one of the trolley wheels crashing to the deck. The
repairs, which have cost about Pounds 150,000, proved unexpectedly
challenging. Although new parts were made to original tolerances, it was
discovered that settlement had caused the towers to sink on one side.
The costs were borne by a number of bodies, including Cleveland,
Middlesbrough and Stockton councils and the Teesside Development
Corporation.
The Transporter is one of 16 such bridges built in the late 19th and early
20th centuries and is the last fully operational transporter bridge in
Britain.
