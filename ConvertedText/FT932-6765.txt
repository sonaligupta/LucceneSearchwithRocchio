FT  27 MAY 93 / Benefits of water sell-off questioned


THE economic benefits of water privatisation may have been overstated, says
a paper published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The paper, by Mr Ted Lynk of the University of Swansea, argues that the
industry in England and Wales may have lost some efficiency when
water-quality monitoring was transferred to the National Rivers Authority.
Comparing efficiency in the 10 large water and sewerage authorities before
they were privatised in 1989 with that in the smaller, privately owned
statutory companies, the paper says: 'The average levels of inefficiency,
relative to potential efficiency, were lowest in the public sector.'
