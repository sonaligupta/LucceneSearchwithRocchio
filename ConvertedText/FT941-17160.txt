FT  06 JAN 94 / World Trade News: Malaysia purchase for Laing


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


John Laing, the UK construction group, has acquired a 5 per cent stake in
YTL Power Generation, which has been contracted to build and operate two
privately financed power stations in Malaysia where it is based.
International construction companies increasingly are acquiring stakes in
ventures involved in private infrastructure projects to increase their share
of this work.
Laing, which has been appointed project manager for building and civil
engineering works of two gas turbine combined cycle power stations at Pasir
Gudang and Paka, is paying MDollars 45m (Pounds 12m) for 5 per cent of the
ordinary and redeemable preference shares of YTL. The construction contract
to Laing is worth just MDollars 17m. Laing said its decision was 'a further
step in the group's strategy of increasing involvement in private
infrastructure projects worldwide.'
The two power stations, costing a combined MDollars 3.5bn, are due to be
completed next year. The first dividends are expected to be paid to
shareholders in 1997.
