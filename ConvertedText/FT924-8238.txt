FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dutch, German steel groups in
co-operation talks

KLOCKNER-Werke, the German plastics, steel and engineering group, said
yesterday that it was examining possible co-operation deals with 'almost
everyone' in the European steel industry.
The company, which confirmed reports of such talks with Hoogovens of the
Netherlands, stressed that there had been no detailed negotiations.
The loss-making Dutch group said it was considering supplying Klockner with
coke and steel plate, but closer links through a merger or
cross-shareholdings were not being discussed.
Both sides agreed the search for partners had been prompted by the depressed
state of the European steel industry.
The German steel industry association says real prices for domestic steel
have fallen below levels reached in the 1965 crisis.
Already depressed by international recession, the market has also been hit
by rising cheap imports from eastern Europe. The association expects 2.3m
tonnes - sold 'at any price' - this year, after only 900,000 tonnes in 1991.
It claims there is up to 25m tonnes excess capacity in the European
Community, and has called repeatedly for restructuring aid and an end to
what it claims are unfair government subsidies in France, Spain and Italy.
Hoogovens, which estimates EC overcapacity at 38m tonnes, has presented
Eurofer, the Community steel association, with a proposal for Ecu1bn
(Dollars 1.23bn) in aid for a restructuring plan which will entail the loss
of 50,000 jobs.
The company, which is in the process of shedding 2,300 workers, has forecast
a record loss for 1992 after a Fl 51m (Dollars 28.41m) deficit last year.
Meanwhile, Klockner, one of the smaller German steel makers with only 3.4m
tonnes capacity, suffers from its relative lack of scale compared with
companies such as Thyssen and Krupp.
A medium-term restructuring programme has already radically altered the
group's shape.
Steel, which accounted for 60 per cent of sales in 1989, contributed only 33
per cent of last year's DM7.2bn (Dollars 4.5bn) group turnover. Plastics,
accounting for 38 per cent, is now the biggest single sector.
However, withdrawal from steel seems unlikely. Klockner is currently
building a DM400m steel galvanising plant at its main base in Bremen.
