FT  30 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ignores bond market
weakness


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US stocks moved ahead yesterday as investors shrugged off further weakness
in the bond market and focused on a fresh batch of economic news, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.38 higher at 3,681.69 while the
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 was 1.89 better at 450.99 in brisk
activity.
In the secondary markets, the American SE composite made scant progress, up
0.99 at 439.91, while the Nasdaq composite improved 2.15 to 733.84.
Cyclical stocks, which led the Dow industrials in retreat during the
previous session, enjoyed a modest rebound. Caterpillar was Dollars 1 ahead
at Dollars 109 7/8 , International Paper put on Dollars 1 to Dollars 65 1/4
, and Exxon gained Dollars 1 as well, to close at Dollars 62 7/8 .
The session brought plenty of evidence to indicate the economy remained on a
sound footing, allowing the market to quell the uneasiness triggered by
Thursday's ambiguous data on growth in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department said that personal income in March increased 0.6 per
cent, while personal spending was up 0.4 per cent. Both figures matched
expectations.
The data's suggestion of improving confidence was reinforced by the
University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment, which climbed to 92.6,
from March's reading of 91.5.
The bond market, meanwhile, continued to slide, with the day's data doing
nothing to shore up the market.
To add to its woes, the dollar was down sharply against other currencies,
making the US-denominated securities less attractive to overseas buyers.
Near midday, however, the Federal Reserve directly intervened in the foreign
exchange markets to prop up the value of the US currency. Bonds, in turn,
steadied, showing a moderate decline at the session's close.
The partial turnround provided extra support for an upturn in stocks, but
investors had to be satisfied with modest improvement. Few the Dow
industrials were showing substantial gains, or losses, going into the final
hours of trading.
But transport stocks surged for a second day running, following a tentative
agreement to end a national truckers' strike. Consolidated Freightways was
up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 .
The flood of corporate earnings buffeting stocks this week slowed to a
trickle yesterday. Ford jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 58 3/8 . Investors
were encouraged by its earnings of Dollars 1.66 a share, against Dollars
1.02 a year earlier.
Elsewhere in the industry, General Motors was unchanged at Dollars 56 3/4
but Chrysler was marked down Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 7/8 .
Scientific-Atlanta also benefited from a strong first quarter. The
cable-television supplier surged Dollars 4 3/8 , or 14 per cent, to Dollars
32 1/4 after posting net income of 31 cents a share, up from 18 cents.
Blockbuster Entertainment gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 27 1/8 amid
speculation that Disney or one of the regional US telephone companies would
bid against Viacom to take over the company.
IMC Fertilizer shed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 37 after an offering of 4m new
shares, to be used to reduce debt, was priced at that level.
Canada
Toronto ended little changed in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index slipped
3.66 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 4,267.12. On the week, the index was up
about 100 points.
Declines edged advances 387 to 363, volume of 55.06m shares was above
Thursday's 48.62m shares, and trading value was CDollars 529.0m compared
with CDollars 637.6m.
Brazil
Equities in Sao Paulo ended up 2.8 per cent in narrow margins on a
featureless day.
The Bovespa index rose 357 points to 17,084 in turnover of CR219bn (Dollars
168m). In Rio de Janeiro the ISENN ended up 2.1 per cent at 64,994.
Brazilian prices retreated 20.9 per cent during April. They were chiefly hit
by higher US interest rates and doubts over the government's anti-inflation
plan.
