   STOCKHOLM


ATLAS COPCO, Europe's largest air compressor manufacturer, yesterday
reported a 32 per cent increase in profits (after financial items) for the
first half of the year to SKr603m (Dollars 115m) from SKr458 for the same
period of 1991.
Sales climbed by 5 per cent at the same time to SKr7.87bn from SKr7.50bn,
while orders rose by 4 per cent to SKr8.57bn from SKr8.24bn. Operating
profit increased by 32 per cent to SKr669m from SKr505m.
Earnings per share increased to SKr17.45 from SKr13.60, a rise of 28 per
cent.
The return on capital employed over the past 12 months was 14.3 per cent, up
from 12.9 per cent, and on shareholders equity 9.8 per cent from 7.8 per
cent.
The company reaffirmed an earlier forecast of an improvement in annual
profits.
It added that an increase in orders was expected as a result of its
acquisition of AEG's power tools operation from January 1 this year.
Despite its strong performance, Atlas Copco said the market for its
industrial products continued to be weak with a slight reduction in orders
in Germany, which is now its single largest market.
There was a marginal improvement in the US but in Asia the sales trend
remained strong although a slow down in demand was noticed in Japan and
South Korea.
