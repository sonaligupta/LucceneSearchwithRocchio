FT  04 SEP 93 / Balladur's popularity rises despite economic problems

FRANCE'S unemployment rate is at 11.7 per cent and rising. Two of the
government's principal policies - a strong franc and European union - have
been undermined by the crisis within Europe's exchange rate mechanism. But
polls released this week show Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, is
more popular than ever.
A survey to be published today in Le Point, the weekly magazine, finds that
Mr Balladur is the only conservative politician who would beat left-wing
rivals in presidential elections scheduled for 1995.
According to the poll, Mr Balladur would beat Mr Jacques Delors, the
socialist European Commission president by 67 per cent to 33 per cent in an
election.
He would defeat Mr Michel Rocard, the probable socialist candidate, by 69
per cent to 31 per cent.
Equally significantly, a Louis Harris poll published in the Globe Hebdo
magazine earlier this week, showed Mr Balladur was much more popular than Mr
Jacques Chirac, leader of the prime minister's Gaullist RPR party.
According to the poll, 67 per cent believed Mr Balladur had a better chance
of being elected president in 1995 and 62 per cent thought he would do a
better job than Mr Chirac.
Most political analysts believe the explanation for the prime minister's
popularity is a result of his competent image and his unflappable nature in
the face of problems ranging from the European currency crisis to the
recession-hit French economy.
They also point to the peaceful 'cohabitation' between Mr Balladur and
France's socialist president Francois Mitterrand.
