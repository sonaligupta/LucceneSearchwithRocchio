FT  27 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bundesbank statements
encourage Frankfurt


   By Our Markets Staff


INTEREST rate prospects continued to dominate continental trading yesterday.
Vienna was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved from a negative position in the pre-bourse to close higher
as weekend statements from some Bundesbank council members led the market to
believe that interest rates would be cut this week.
In spite of warnings from Mr Helmut Schlesinger yesterday that inflation
would rise next year and from Chancellor Helmut Kohl on the possibility of
early tax increases, the DAX index closed 15.67 higher at 1,542.49 as
turnover fell to DM4.7bn from DM5.2bn.
The positive mood was reflected in leading shares which showed strong
advances. But Daimler-Benz managed a gain of just 80 pfg to DM561.80 after
denying weekend press reports that its Mercedes-Benz division would show a
loss this year because of weaker car sales. Mercedes fell DM3 to DM423.
Other car manufacturers reflected the depressed state of the industry while
BMW's DM7 gain to DM492 may have been helped by the stronger dollar which
supported export-orientated companies.
Investors took little notice of a magazine report that Thyssen was thinking
of cutting its dividend this year to DM8 from DM10 and the shares rose DM5
to DM162.
PARIS made an unexciting start to the new trading account, which was
reflected in the modest turnover of FFr1.8bn. A lower Matif amid
disappointment that a  1/4 point cut in interest rates did not materialise
took the CAC-40 index off its day's high of 1,785.44 to end 4.33 higher at
1,770.74.
Sextant Avionique jumped FFr22.50 or 21.2 per cent to FFr128.50 following
statements from senior executives at its parent Thomson-CSF that the company
was expected to approach break-even by year-end.
Among other risers were Moulinex which rose FFr4.10 to FFr84 after its
recent, heavy fall and Euro Disney which added FFr2.40 to FFr78.95. Losers
included L'Oreal, down FFr17 to FFr977 and Saint-Gobain which fell FFr7.40
to FFr487.
AMSTERDAM began the week where it had left off, with continued interest in
Fokker. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.2 to 104.1.
The aircraft manufacturer's shares recovered some 13 per cent as the
government said that it would give details of the takeover terms with Dasa.
The expected announcement had still not come by the close and Fokker
finished Fl 2.40 higher at Fl 18.20.
DAF slipped to an all-time low of Fl 10 before recovering slightly to end 30
cents lower at Fl 10.50. The group said on Friday that it was to reduce
working hours because of the slowdown in new truck sales.
DSM was Fl 1.30 lower at Fl 85.40 ahead of Thursday's third-quarter figures
which are expected to confirm the depressed state of the chem-icals sector.
ZURICH noted interest in Volksbank after the group announced that it was to
change its status from a co-operative into a joint-stock company. After a
brief suspension, Volksbank bearers advanced SFr40 before closing SFr20
higher at SFr805. The SMI index gained 9.9 to 1,930.9.
Other banks also firmed as money market rates eased further: UBS bearers,
the day's most active issue, advanced SFr8 to SFr833.
Among the insurers Swiss Re bearers put on SFr20 to SFr2,520, while Zurich
certificates rose SFr6 to SFr956.
MILAN closed off the day's highs on profit-taking after Friday's interest
rate cut. Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not follow suit also
prompted some selling. The Comit index rose 2.51 to 419.70 in turnover
estimated at L160bn after Friday's relatively heavy L241bn.
The food group Sme attracted attention on continued hopes that it would soon
be privatised. The stock added L261 or 5.8 per cent to L4,738. By contrast,
shares in Nuovo Pignone, another privatisation stock, fell heavily and were
suspended towards the end of trading, having fixed L555 lower at L5,100.
Elsewhere, Stet jumped L47 or 3.7 per cent to L1,325 on bargain-hunting
after its recent weakness.
MADRID retreated marginally, the general index falling 1.16 to 200.02.
Telefonica, which said that it expects group revenue to increase by 16 per
cent from 1991, improved Pta6 to Pta956, although recent presentations in
London and Madrid have disappointed some analysts.
STOCKHOLM gathered momentum after the central bank cut interest rates but
fell back later on profit-taking. The Affarsvarlden index closed 1.0 higher
at 722.9 in turnover down to SKr357m from Friday's SKr616m.
The forestry sector showed a gain of some 1.3 per cent as exporters were
lifted by the stronger US currency.
OSLO saw Elkem's A shares tumble by more than 25 per cent after the group
reported bigger than expected interim losses on Friday. The A shares lost
NKr5.5 to NKr16.0 while the free shares shed NKr8 to NKr20. However,
strength elsewhere left the all-share index up 3.66 to 352.63 in turnover of
NKr274.5m.
BRUSSELS closed narrowly mixed in thin trading as further gains in Petrofina
offset declines among some industrial stocks. The Bel-20 Index inched 1.84
higher to 1,134.80 in turnover of BFr760m.
Petrofina closing BFr160 or 2.1 per cent higher at BFr7,750 while Solvay
dropped BFr75 to BFr11,625 and Electrabel fell BFr60 to BFr5,310.
HELSINKI continued to gain strongly on lower domestic interest rates and the
HEX index firmed 2.8 per cent to close at 709.6. Turnover amounted to
FM83.8m.
