FT  12 MAR 93 / Reserve Bank of Australia will be made more accountable if
Labor wins election


   By KEVIN BROWN


   SYDNEY


Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday signalled that the
Reserve Bank of Australia would be made more accountable for the conduct of
monetary policy if Labor wins tomorrow's election, writes Kevin Brown in
Sydney.
Answering questions at the National Press Club, Mr Keating said high
unemployment had been exacerbated by the bank's reluctance to cut interest
rates as quickly as the government had wished. Mr Keating said monetary
policy was decided by 'an appointed board that is not elected and has no
reference to the way in which the economy operates.'
