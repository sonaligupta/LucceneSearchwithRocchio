FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Pearson advances 34% to Pounds 46m - Strong
performances by investment banking and newspapers


   By PAUL TAYLOR


PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group that owns the
Financial Times, yesterday reported a 34 per cent increase in first-half
pre-tax profits, mainly reflecting the strong performance of its investment
banking and newspaper interests.
Profits increased from Pounds 34.6m to Pounds 46.3m in the period to June
30, including a Pounds 3.1m (Pounds 11.6m) surplus on the sale of fixed
assets.
Sales from continuing operations rose 19 per cent to Pounds 824.4m (Pounds
694.8m) with currency movements accounting for Pounds 77m of the gain.
Currency changes added Pounds 2m to pre-tax profits and had an impact on net
interest costs, which rose to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 7.3m) despite net debt
falling to Pounds 170m (Pounds 185m).
Earnings per share rose by 41 per cent to 6.2p (4.4p) and the interim
dividend is maintained at 5.375p.
Mr Guy Lamming, a media analyst at James Capel, said the results were
'better than had been expected' and indicated that the group's recently
announced plans to focus on its media and entertainment businesses were
correct. Pearson's share price, which has risen sharply over the past year,
gained a further 6p to close at 519p.
As part of the new strategy, Pearson plans to spin-off its Royal Doulton
fine china division later this year and sell a majority stake in Camco, the
US oilfield equipment and services division, through a public offering in
New York.
Commenting on the results Lord Blakenham, chairman, said they reflected 'a
substantial improvement in underlying performance'.
They showed the benefits of three years of cost-cutting. 'We have become
more profitable in indifferent trading conditions and are making the most of
the patchy recovery we have seen in some of our markets. The outlook
continues promising.'
Operating profits jumped by 70 per cent to Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 30.3m) with
all the main divisions, except books and fine china, achieving gains.
Investment banking interests, including the 50 per cent stake in Lazard
Brothers in London, benefited from the improved market climate and more than
doubled their profit contribution to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 7m).
Newspapers operating profits rose to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 15.1m) despite
continuing flat advertising volumes. Within that, the FT Group, including
the newspaper, business information services, and Les Echos, the French
business paper, contributed Pounds 18m (Pounds 13.2m) and Westminster Press
Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 1.9m).
In contrast, the books division, which generally makes its profits in the
second half, saw its contribution fall to Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m). Higher
losses at Addison-Wesley, the US-based educational publisher, offset gains
at Penguin and Longman.
Profits from entertainment increased to Pounds 2.9m (Pounds 1.6m) boosted by
substantially more visitors to the attractions, particularly the Tussauds
group. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, said visitor numbers
were 13 per cent higher at 3.8m in the first half.
Mr Barlow added that a new television division would be set up for the 17.5
per cent interest in BSkyB, the satellite venture, the 14 per cent stake in
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees and the recently acquired Thames Television production
company.
He also said Pearson was seeking to expand its television interests in
continental Europe and Asia as regulations constrain its growth in the US
and UK television markets. No deal was imminent, but he said: 'Watch this
space.'
Oil services achieved a sharp improvement but that was masked by other
factors. As a result operating profits were up to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 7.4m)
on turnover of Pounds 182m (Pounds 128m).
