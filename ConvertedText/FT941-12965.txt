FT  27 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel chief optimistic


   By RICHARD WATERS


Shares in Bethlehem Steel jumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 23 1/4 yesterday
as the US's second biggest steelmaker reported a continuing improvement in
its operating position and a further restructuring charge.
Projecting another year of strong steel demand, Mr Curtis Barnette,
chairman, said the economic recovery and only a small rise in imports
'should result in 1994 domestic industry shipments which match or exceed
1993's estimated 87m tons.
'We expect that Bethlehem will be profitable for the year 1994,' he added.
The rise in its shares reversed a bout of profit-taking the day before,
confirming Bethlehem as one of the best performing large company stocks this
year. Bethlehem has risen from below Dollars 17 in early December as
investors have sensed a revival in the fortunes of steel companies.
Yesterday, the company reported a Dollars 350m charge (Dollars 290m after
tax) to cover a revised modernisation plan for its structural products
business and to write down a coke plant at its Sparrows Point works. The
plan will result in the loss of 2,000 jobs, compared with 1,500 expected
under an earlier plan.
