FT  16 NOV 93 / Yorkshire Water may appeal over conviction


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


YORKSHIRE WATER is considering an appeal after the High Court yesterday
upheld its conviction in a case where poisonous waste was illegally poured
into a sewer owned by the company.
The case has wide implications for the water industry.
The waste, which the company says was not readily treatable, passed through
the waterworks at North Bierley near Bradford, Yorkshire and polluted the
river Spen.
Yorkshire Water was convicted by Batley and Dewsbury magistrates of causing
the pollution, but Wakefield Crown Court overturned the conviction because
it said the company was not responsible.
That judgment was successfully appealed by the National Rivers Authority
yesterday. The High Court found that Yorkshire Water 'caused' the pollution
by allowing the waste to pass through its works. Mr Justice Buckley said,
however, that the size of the penalties imposed might be affected by the
fact that the company could not have known of its presence.
Yorkshire Water said there were points of law to be decided, and it might
appeal to the House of Lords.
It said: 'At question is whether a sewerage under-taker has a statutory
defence where it receives an illegal discharge by a third party. Yorkshire
Water believes that it and other water companies which regularly face this
situation cannot be liable on the charge of 'causing poisonous, noxious or
polluting matter to enter controlled waters'.'
