FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: GE targets HVAC


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


General Electric of the US said it hoped by 1995 to have between 5 and 10
per cent of the world market in small motors for use in residential heating,
ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, writes Alan Friedman.
The company outlined its strategic goal after the launch yesterday of a new
variable-speed motor that GE said was 20 per cent more energy efficient than
conventional induction motors now used in the sector.
GE said Carrier and Trane, two air-conditioning makers, had already agreed
to use the new motor.
