FT  30 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Flextech shows increased midway
deficit of Pounds 3.2m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


FLEXTECH, the cable and satellite television group, yesterday announced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.2m for the six months to June 30, against a
deficit of Pounds 2.91m in the comparable period which covered the six
months to September 30.
Losses per share deepened to 6.68p (5.86p).
The results reflected the change in the accounting year from March 31 to
December 31 and included only media interests following the disposal of the
oil services interests, completed in July 1992.
The company, which earlier this week announced plans to buy for shares the
European programming business of Tele-Communications by Christmas, increased
sales to Pounds 2.66m (Pounds 2.15m).
The deal would give TCI, the US broadcasting company which is itself in
merger talks with Bell Atlantic, a controlling stake in the enlarged
company, more than doubling Flextech's capitalisation to Pounds 200m.
'Notwithstanding the losses incurred during the period the board, given the
changes taking place, are convinced of the potential of the core business
and look forward to the future with confidence,' said Mr Stanislas
Yussakovich, chairman.
Flextech, which holds a 50.1 per cent interest in The Children's Channel and
will hold 39 per cent of The Family Channel, also plans to hold 85 per cent
of Action Stations, a project to open children's indoor play areas in the
UK.
The sites will consist of games and play areas combined with retail outlets
and food facilities. Flextech said participants will include The Discovery
Channel, TCC and TFC.
