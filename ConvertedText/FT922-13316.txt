FT  13 APR 92 / Hyundai refused loans by state bank

THE state-owned Korea Development Bank (KDB) is refusing industrial loans to
the Hyundai group, the second largest business group in South Korea, because
of a dispute between the conglomerate and the government.
Hyundai has complained that while the KDB granted Won250bn (Pounds 190m) in
loans to the group last year for the expansion or improvement of plant
facilities, the bank has not acted on its request for Won300bn in loans this
year.
KDB said it was refusing to make loans to Hyundai because its
creditworthiness could deteriorate due to its conflict with the government.
The government has imposed a series of financial restrictions on Hyundai
following the recent success in the National Assembly election of the
political party established by the founder of Hyundai, Mr Chung Ju-yung.
However, the government made conciliatory moves over the weekend in an
apparent effort to defuse the situation.
Mr Chung Se-yung, Hyundai chairman, met Mr Lee Jin-seol, senior presidential
secretary for economic affairs, to discuss the impact the feud would have on
the economy.
The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) also postponed a decision to deprive
Hyundai Electronics Industries (HEI) of its preferential rights to bank
loans.
