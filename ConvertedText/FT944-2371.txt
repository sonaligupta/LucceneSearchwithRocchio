FT  16 DEC 94 / Observer: Expensive exit


Forget Trafalgar House's Nigel Rich or his big boss, Simon Keswick. The man
to watch in the coming battle for Newcastle's Northern Electric is Ian
Robinson, a 52-year-old Geordie who has been running Trafalgar House's
biggest business, its engineering division.
A fortnight ago, he handed in his notice to take up a new job as chief
executive of ScottishPower - which also happens to be very interested in
what happens to Northern Electric. Not only does Robinson know where the
weak spots are in Trafalgar House's brand new top management team - and
there are still a few - but he should also have a pretty good idea of Traf's
game plan for Northern Electric. Hard to imagine an old pro like Lord Hanson
letting such a key player slip away at such a crucial time.
