FT  06 JUN 92 / Pawlak chosen Polish PM


   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINKSI


   WARSAW


Poland yesterday got its fourth prime minister in the three years since the
fall of the communist regime when parliament voted in Mr Waldemar Pawlak, a
32-year-old farmer and head of the PSL farmers' party, as the head of
government, writes Chistopher Bobinksi in Warsaw. Parliament also passed
overwhelmingly a tough, IMF-backed budget, as a first step toward winning
back credits and investment.
