FT  16 NOV 93 / Eurotunnel chief leads private finance initiative


   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor


SIR Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel, is to chair the government's
private finance working group, established to create a closer partnership
between the public and private sectors.
Announcing the initiative yesterday at the Confederation of British
Industry's annual conference, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the
government was determined to break new ground in developing public sector
projects with private finance.
'Just as privatisation broke new ground, so will private finance. This
working group will turn the project into reality,' he said.
Other private sector members of the working group are Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general; Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England; Mr
Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, Mr Neville Simms, chief
executive of Tarmac; and Ms Sheila Masters, a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accountants.
Mr Steve Robson, deputy secretary at the Treasury in charge of private
finance projects, will head the Whitehall side of the committee and be
joined by civil servants from the departments of Trade and Industry,
Transport, Employment and Health.
Whitehall officials acknowledge that there is resistance to the project from
both the public and private sectors. They argue, however, that just as there
were big gains for those who took part in privatisation, so will there be
big rewards for companies that take part in the private finance initiative.
To that end, the Treasury published a new guide to private finance, Breaking
New Ground, which highlights the possible opportunities for companies that
decide to take part. Mr Clarke hoped the working group would be able to
speed up public sector projects with private finance.
Sir Alastair said that since the 'public purse' was only a fraction of what
it had been, it was his aim to look at new ways of financing public sector
projects.
He planned to identify areas of activity where it might be possible to make
immediate progress as well as to encourage potential private sector
participants in the initiative.
