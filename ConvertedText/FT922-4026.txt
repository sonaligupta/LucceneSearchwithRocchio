FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: EC reaction to the Danish vote


LAST week's Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty sent tremors through
the European Community. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign
minister, did his best to salvage the remnants of Denmark's European
policies; President Francois Mitterrand called a referendum; Chancellor
Helmut Kohl confronted growing German opposition to European monetary union;
Prime Minister John Major faced a backbench Commons revolt which could
sabotage Britain's bid to play a constructive European role during its
six-month presidency starting next month; and Italy struggled on with the
task of trying to form a government.
EC foreign ministers met in Oslo, and tried to pretend it was business as
usual. Around the continent the voters pondered the confusion - and wondered
what it all meant. Denmark's referendum exposed a deep gulf between the
pro-Maastricht policies of the country's political establishment and the
hopes and fears of ordinary voters.
To assess reaction to last week's events, Financial Times reporters went on
to the streets at the weekend and asked citizens in Britain, France, Germany
and Italy for their views on the Community's post-Copenhagen crisis.
