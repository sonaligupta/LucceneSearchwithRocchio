FT  05 MAR 94 / How the plant will operate


Final tests in preparation for shearing the fuel rods, the next stage of the
commissioning of Thorp, have already begun. Shearing - or cutting up - will
probably go ahead within the next month.
The first fuel rods for reprocessing at Thorp arrived in 1988 and have since
been stored in ponds to allow short-lived highly radioactive isotopes to
decay.
Some of the fuel has already been moved to the 'head-end plant' where it
will be sheared into smaller pieces and dropped down a chute to a basket
suspended in nitric acid.
Dissolved fuel is transferred to the chemical separation plant where the
uranium and plutonium are parted from the waste. The uranium and plutonium
are then separated from each other, and converted to solid form for storage
and eventual re-use.
