FT  09 JAN 92 / Athens forced to tighten pollution curbs


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


THE Greek government yesterday extended emergency measures to curb high
atmospheric pollution levels in Athens, ordering heating in public buildings
to be shut off and factories to reduce fuel consumption by a third.
More than 400 people have been taken to hospital in the past 48 hours with
breathing problems attributed to increased amounts of smoke, carbon
monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide in the air.
The ban on private cars circulating in the city centre remained in effect,
while only half the taxi fleet was permitted to operate in the five square
mile central zone.
The government faces mounting criticism for delaying new legislation to
reduce traffic congestion in Athens.
