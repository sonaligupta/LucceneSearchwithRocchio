FT  03 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading water reclamation works


COSTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES has been awarded an Pounds 11.2m contract by
Severn Trent Water for what is believed to be one of the biggest mechanical
and electrical (M&E) contracts to be awarded in the industry this year.
Costain was one of seven companies bidding for the contract to extend and
refurbish the Netheridge Water Reclamation Works which serves most of
Gloucester's city urban area.
Built in the late 1950's, the plant is still geared to its original dry
weather capacity of 17m litres per day (ml/d). With population growth, the
capacity forecast for the year 2001 is 42 ml/d dry weather flow (DWF) which,
together with the need to process waste from a major new food plant,
requires the plant to be upgraded.
At present, Netheridge provides primary treatment only to storm water and
sewage. In order to meet the increased demand and the standards set by the
National Rivers Authority and European Community municipal waste water
directives, secondary treatment will be introduced. The capacity of the
works will be 108 ml/d DWF, with a storm treatment capacity of 235 ml/d.
Costain's work includes the design, supply, installation and testing of all
M&E equipment, including high-voltage electrical supplies and SCADA systems.
