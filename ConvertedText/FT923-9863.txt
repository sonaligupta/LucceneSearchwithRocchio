FT  03 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Inland Revenue offices in Sussex


WARINGS, Portsmouth, has won a Pounds 7m design and build contract for new
Inland Revenue offices at Durrington-on-Sea near Worthing.
The four-storey brick and block clad building with pitched aluminium roof
will be located on the car parking areas to the east side of the office
buildings forming the Worthing headquarters.
Planned in the form of a rectangle with a landscaped central atrium, the
building is designed to allow easy communication and flexibility.
The 75,000 sq ft building will re-house around 470 Inland Revenue staff
already working at the Durrington complex. Work on the 89-week contract is
scheduled for completion in April 1994.
Coldunell has awarded the company a Pounds 1.7m contract for the total
refurbishment of the Mitre Hotel at Hampton Court. Work has started and
completion is scheduled for autumn 1993.
Other recently awarded work includes a Pounds 610,000 refurbishment for WH
Smith in Fareham and a Pounds 380,000 award for alterations to the
loading/unloading bays at Sainsbury's distribution depot in Basingstoke.
