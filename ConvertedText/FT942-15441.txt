FT  15 APR 94 / Clarke forecasts steady recovery


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


The UK is on course for a low rate of inflation and a 'steadily
strengthening' economic recovery, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told
the Commons yesterday.
In an upbeat assessment aimed at ending fears about the impact of tax
increases taking effect this month he said Britain was set to have the
fastest growing economy in western Europe this year and next.
Mr Clarke played down his recent differences with Mr Eddie George, governor
of the Bank of England, over interest-rate policy,
These were highlighted by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, following the
publication on Wednesday of the minutes of meetings earlier this year
between Mr Clarke and the governor.
Mr Brown reminded the chancellor that in February he had stated that a
quarter point interest-rate cut was sufficient, while telling Mr George
twice as much was necessary.
Mr Clarke said the 'genuine discussion' ended in agreement and with him
exercising his responsibility as chancellor to decide interest-rate levels.
