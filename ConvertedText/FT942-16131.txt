FT  12 APR 94 / Observer: Grapes of froth


Champagne socialists naturally are prone to error when it comes to lesser
drinks. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that Britain's Labour party
confuses Bordeaux with Rhone in its brochure of upmarket summer gifts. It
offers two bottles of Chateauneuf de (sic) Pape for Pounds 21.75, describing
them as 'a pair of world-famous clarets'.
