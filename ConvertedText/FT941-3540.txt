FT  16 MAR 94 / Japan trade surplus with US declines in February

Japan's trade surplus with the US fell for the first time in nine months in
February, the ministry of finance said yesterday.
The slight drop in the surplus will help reduce tension with the US. But
Washington will need further and more substantial falls over an extended
period before it is convinced the problem has been solved.
The surplus with the US was Dollars 4.344bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in February, a
fall of 0.9 per cent compared with the same month last year. Imports from
the US rose 15.1 per cent, while exports grew by 6.8 per cent.
Car sales in the US were down sharply, hindered by the strong yen, but
exports of semiconductors continued to rise. Imports of US computers, food
and machinery surged in February, as did aircraft deliveries.
Analysts said the level of the surplus with the US, which was below
expectations, would help support the dollar against the yen.
Japan's overall trade surplus was up 3.3 per cent in February compared with
the same month last year, reaching a record Dollars 10.912bn, although the
increase was lower than that in previous months. In December and January,
the surplus rose 15.5 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. In yen terms,
the surplus, which had risen in January, dropped 9.1 per cent to Y1,186bn.
Japanese exports rose 5.6 per cent to Dollars 29.532bn, while imports grew 7
per cent to Dollars 18.62bn. Imports of food, including foreign rice, were
up 20.3 per cent year on year.
The growing importance of Japan's trade with other Asian countries was
underlined by a 2.6 per cent increase in exports to Asean nations and a 0.7
per cent rise in imports. Exports to China were up 0.8 per cent while
imports rose 3.6 per cent.
The markets were surprised by a rise in domestic machinery orders placed by
the private sector during January. These orders represent a leading
indicator of capital investment intentions. A fall of about 6 per cent had
been expected, but they increased 1.9 per cent against the previous month,
data released by the Economic Planning Agency showed.
