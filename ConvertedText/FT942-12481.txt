FT  29 APR 94 / People: Nikko Europe promotes Fukuda


Haruko Fukuda has been appointed to the newly created position of vice
chairman of Nikko Europe, the highest ranking post held by a woman at the
Japanese securities company.
Fukuda was educated in the US and UK, as well as Japan, and holds an MA from
Cambridge University. She was already the top woman at Nikko in her previous
position as board director, which she took up in 1988. Her areas of
responsibility in that job included corporate finance and European strategy.
Previously, she was a partner at James Capel, where she headed the Japanese
department.
'Although Japanese by nationality, Haruko Fukuda is a prominent and highly
respected City figure. Her appointment is yet another signal of our
intention to place responsibility for our future growth and success on the
skills and knowledge of local staff,' a spokesman said. 'As local staff
herself, she will be spearheading this change, providing as she does a
unique bridge between Japanese and English business cultures.'
The promotion of local staff to senior positions is a relatively new
development at Japanese financial institutions, which in the past have
tended to appoint senior managers on assignment from Tokyo for relatively
brief stints.
