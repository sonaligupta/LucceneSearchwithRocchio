ABB Power Generation and Pyropower Corporation of California have won a
Dollars 363m contract to modernise two 200MW generators at the Turow power
station in south-west Poland. The consortium also has the option to work on
four more generators at Turow. Most of the equipment for the first stage of
the project will be locally produced in plants like ABB Zamech bought by the
Swiss-Swedish engineering company in 1990 and Fakop in Sosnowiec, recently
bought by Pyropower.
Turow, which is fuelled with brown coal, is in the middle of the 'black
triangle', one of central Europe's most polluted areas, between Poland, the
Czech Republic and the former east Germany. The new generators and boilers
will reduce emissions to European Union standards and increase fuel
efficiency.
