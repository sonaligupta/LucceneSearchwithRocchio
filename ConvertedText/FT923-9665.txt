FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Trencherwood swaps debt for equity as
losses mount


   By ANGUS FOSTER


TRENCHERWOOD, the USM-quoted housebuilder, has reached agreement in
principle for its bankers to take a 'substantial' stake in the company, in
return for conversion of debt and unsecured liabilities.
Details of the debt for equity swap are likely to be finalised in the next
few weeks and are subject to legal and other conditions, the company said.
The conversion will secure borrowing facilities until the end of 1997.
Midland, Royal Bank of Scotland and Schroders are Trencherwood's main
bankers.
'We're very pleased, especially when many other property companies have
fallen by the wayside,' said Mr Richard Brooke, finance director.
Trencherwood yesterday reported mounting pre-tax losses of Pounds 37.7m in
the year to October 31, from Pounds 29.3m in the previous period. Mr John
Norgate, chairman, said conditions had deteriorated during the year and he
expected a further decline in volumes this time.
Operating losses were contained to Pounds 863,000 (Pounds 2.92m) thanks to
cost cutting. But exceptional items increased to Pounds 29.9m (Pounds
23.3m). These included about Pounds 15m of provisions against land holdings
and work in progress, restructuring costs of about Pounds 2.5m and Pounds
12m of provisions against losses in the company's property joint ventures.
Turnover fell to Pounds 28.8m (Pounds 38.3m). A total of 306 units (328)
were sold during the year at an average price of Pounds 78,000. Prices were
not comparable with the last year because the types of unit sold differed.
Pressure on margins led to a Pounds 3.6m loss before exceptionals in the
residential division.
The company continued to reduce its exposure to off-balance sheet associated
companies. Off-balance sheet borrowings fell to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 26.9m).
But increased borrowings for land purchases lifted total bank borrowings to
Pounds 45m (Pounds 40.5m). The loss for the year of Pounds 34.3m resulted in
negative net assets of Pounds 12.5m (net assets Pounds 21.8m).
No dividend is recommended. Losses per share increased to 137.01p (102.39p).
