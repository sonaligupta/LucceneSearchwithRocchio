FT  22 OCT 92 / Ukraine spending comes under fire


   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND

MR VADYM HETMAN, the outspoken chairman of Ukraine's central bank, yesterday
renewed his crusade for a tighter monetary policy by lashing out at his
government's spendthrift policies. He also called for a postponement of
Ukraine's plans to introduce a separate currency.
A technocrat with a good reputation in western financial circles, Mr Hetman
said Ukraine must kick its inflationary habit of bailing out inefficient
state enterprises with government credit. Similar statements made over the
summer earned Mr Hetman a public rebuke from President Leonid Kravchuk.
According to government statistics, since January Ukraine has issued
unbacked credit totalling Rbs211.8bn to save faltering Ukrainian
enterprises.
Arguing that this soft credit policy meant Ukraine was exporting inflation
to Russia, last month Russia froze all payments from Ukraine, provoking a
furious response from Kiev. Mr Hetman yesterday took the unprecedented step
of siding with Russia on the payments issue.
He noted that Ukraine had come under criticism from the International
Monetary Fund for its piecemeal economic policy-making.
Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine yesterday appeared to end a row over the cost
of gas which has disrupted supplies to western Europe when Ukraine diverted
them from storage tanks and domestic industry to the export market. A
statement from Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, quoting gas
distributors Ukrgazprom, said deliveries of Russian gas to customers in the
west had returned to normal.
Germany's largest gas supplier, Ruhrgas AG, had said earlier that Russian
gas supplies were still 20 per cent below normal because of the row.
