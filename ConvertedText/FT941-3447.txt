FT  16 MAR 94 / Observer: Nails out at Birmingham


Masochistic voyeurs have enjoyed watching Birmingham's local government draw
up a list of candidates to recline on the bed of nails marked chief
executive; the present occupant, Roger Taylor, has decided to go early.
Why should intelligent bureaucrats step in between the warring fiefdoms of
council departments and combative councillors? It has to be the eighth
deadly sin: ambition. Brum is England's largest metropolitan authority.
The council is silent over who wants the Pounds 80,000-a-year job, but word
is that among the 10 names in the frame are two women - Sheffield's Pamela
Gordon and Southwark's Anna Wyatt. There is thus the intriguing possibility
of a female alliance emerging. Theresa Stewart, the current Labour leader,
faces difficult elections in May. Does she favour either Gordon or Wyatt?
The last woman chief executive in the West Midlands - at Sandwell -
eventually decamped for New Zealand. Must be something in the water . . .
