FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): A new FT
service for investors


THE Financial Times has launched a new, free service for private investors
who would like to receive the annual reports and interim reports of listed
companies.
All you need to do is ring
081 643-7181 and quote a code which is listed at the end of the London Share
Service listings in the FT. This code is changed every week. Then name the
company concerned, and give your name and address. The report will be sent
to you on the next working day.
The lines are open between 9am and 5.30pm on weekdays, and there is an
answering service at other times.
At present, 130 listed companies have agreed to join the service. The
companies concerned are identified with an ace-of-clubs symbol ( ) in the
share listings pages.
Only one annual report per company can be sent to each caller, but you may
order the reports of several different companies.
