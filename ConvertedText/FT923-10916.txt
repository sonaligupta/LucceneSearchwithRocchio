   PARIS


DEVANLAY, the French textile group, is strengthening its hold over Lacoste
sportswear by buying the North American manufacturing and distribution
rights to the brand.
Since 1977 Lacoste has been manufactured and distributed in North America by
Crystal Brands, a US clothing company.
Crystal's contract runs until June 30 1993 and will then be taken up by
Devanlay, which already holds 35 per cent of Chemise Lacoste, the company
responsible for Lacoste's sports shirts.
Crystal is also selling its 50 per cent interest in Lacoste Alligator, the
holding company for the brand, to the Lacoste family and Devanlay.
