FT  02 NOV 93 / House prices are up on year, says society


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


HOUSE PRICES have recorded an annual increase for the first time since
Nationwide started its house price index in 1990.
The building society said yesterday that an average house price of Pounds
53,932 during October was 1.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding
month last year.
Nationwide said the comparisons had been distorted partially by large price
falls which occurred last autumn when sterling left the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Nationwide is the second building society to announce that prices have begun
to rise year-on-year.
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported a 1 per cent rise in
the 12 months to the end of September, the first annual increase since
January 1991. Halifax is due to publish its October house price figures
tomorrow.
Despite the improvement, the industry says the housing recovery remains
fragile.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations manager, said yesterday: 'Although
conditions for a more substantial recovery in activity are in place, the
market remains muted to some extent, perhaps because of uncertainty ahead of
the Budget.
'Our estate agents report that in many areas there is a shortage of
good-quality, reasonably priced property available as potential sellers
delay putting their houses on the market. Even so, the market is less
volatile than it was a year ago.'
Nationwide said prices had risen by 1.5 per cent between September and
October, an increase of Pounds 783 in the average price.
