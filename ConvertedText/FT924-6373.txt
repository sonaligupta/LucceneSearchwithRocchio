FT  21 NOV 92 / UK Company News: TR Property cuts interim dividend


Hit by a severely weak UK property market, TR Property Investment Trust
reported an 18 per cent fall in net asset value per share to 25.34p at
September 30, against 30.7p six months earlier.
In the light of the difficult conditions, the interim dividend has been
reduced by 33 per cent to 0.4p (0.6p) despite increased earnings per share
of 0.5p, against 0.39p last time.
Mr Paul Hyde-Thomson, chairman, said the dividend decision reflected the
board's continuing strategy of readying the trust to move swiftly on
opportunities once the property market allowed.
Pre-interest profits rose 48 per cent to Pounds 3.64m (Pounds 2.46m) mainly
due to to the increase in rental flow that offset an expected fall in
franked and unfranked dividend income. Pre-tax profits rose 43 per cent to
Pounds 2.2m.
