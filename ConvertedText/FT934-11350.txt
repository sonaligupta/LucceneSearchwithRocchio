FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: JVC passes dividend as losses
continue

THE slowdown in the domestic market and the strength of the yen this year
dealt a blow to JVC, the maker of video cassette recorders and other
audio-visual products.
The Japanese company announced a pre-tax loss of Y9.9bn (Dollars 93.3m),
against a deficit of Y13.5bn a year earlier, on sales 1 per cent lower at
Y251.4bn and passed its interim dividend. Net loss was Y10.6bn against
Y15.9bn.
JVC is dependent on its audio-visual products for 79 per cent of its sales,
nearly half of which come from overseas markets where the yen's strength
cuts price competitiveness.
Video cassette sales in Japan have been on the decline, with shipments down
9 per cent this year according to industry estimates.
JVC expects losses to accumulate in the second half and predicts a pre-tax
loss of Y25bn and net loss of Y26.5bn for the full-year on sales of Y505bn.
