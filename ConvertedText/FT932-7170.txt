FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Citicorp plea for O&Y denied


   By REUTER


A US bankruptcy court yesterday denied a motion by Citicorp, the US bank, to
appoint a 'responsible officer' to run the US unit of Olympia and York, the
troubled property developer, but said it would appoint an examiner to call
up a 'protocol' agreement to consider creditor consent, Reuter reports.
Citicorp and other unsecured creditors wanted Mr John Zucotti, president of
O&Y in the US, to be named either a responsible officer or trustee.
