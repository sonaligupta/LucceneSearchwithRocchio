FT  06 JAN 94 / Germany to press EU on telecoms


Germany will press for an end-of-decade deadline for the liberalisation of
telecommunications infrastructure across the European Union when it assumes
the EU's presidency in July, write Andrew Adonis and Ariane Genillard.
Mr Wolfgang Botsch, German telecommunications minister, said yesterday that
Germany wanted to see liberalisation take place two years after competition
is introduced in basic voice services, which will take place in 1998 in most
EU states. The 1998 deadline will allow telecom operators to provide rival
services across each other's networks. However, existing EU policy does not
extend to allowing competitors to build their own infrastructure.
The European Commission is due to publish a policy statement on
telecommunications infrastructure early next year. But the Greek socialist
government, which holds the EU presidency, is unenthusiastic about
liberalisation, and little progress is likely to be made until Germany
succeeds in July.
The UK is currently the only EU state to allow full infrastructure
competition.
However, the Netherlands is likely to allow a consortium of utilities and
others to build a second network to compete with the state operator when it
is partially privatised this year. Infrastructure competition is also
permitted in some Scandinavian countries.
