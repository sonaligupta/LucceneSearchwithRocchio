FT  04 AUG 92 / Europe's spending on advertising falls


   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent


EUROPEAN advertising expenditure declined sharply in 1991 according to
figures published yesterday by Zenith Media, the media buying and planning
wing of the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising group.
Advertising revenue in Spain collapsed last year, following six years of
real growth in excess of 11 per cent annually. Zenith expects the decline to
continue this year, despite the impact of the Barcelona Olympics and
Seville's Expo '92. The recent proliferation of television channels in the
country has led to heavy discounting of advertising space.
In France, the world's fifth largest advertising market by expenditure, a
return to real growth is not expected before 1994.
The French industry is forecast to grow in nominal terms by 2.4 per cent
this year, representing negative real growth of 0.6 per cent.
Negative real growth is also expected in Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland.
Zenith suggests there is ground for optimism in the UK, with television
advertising expenditure up by 2.1 per cent in real terms in the first half
of 1992. However, the figure must be set against a real decline of 4.1 per
cent in UK tele-vision advertising revenue last year.
The US advertising industry also saw slight improvement in the first half of
this year. According to the study, US advertising - which accounts for about
39 per cent of world major media expenditure - should move from decline into
real growth in 1994.
But Zenith has revised downwards its forecasts made last December for global
advertising spending in 1992; moving from 5.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent
nominal growth, or 0.6 per cent in real terms.
