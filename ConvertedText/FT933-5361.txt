FT  03 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Burmah Castrol ahead 12% - Enhanced scrip
dividend pleases market and helps shares rise 15p


   By ANDREW BOLGER


SHARES IN Burmah Castrol rose by 15p to 813p yesterday after the lubricants,
chemicals and fuel group announced a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
and an enhanced scrip dividend.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 80.6m to Pounds 90.5m in the six months to
June 30, while sales increased by 18 per cent, from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds
1.35bn.
The group said conditions in the second half of 1993 were likely to be
similar to the first half but the longer-term outlook was encouraging.
Mr Lawrence Urquhart, chairman, said that in the second half recession in
continental Europe would be counterbalanced by more favourable conditions in
the rest of the world.
Earnings per share rose by 18 per cent, from 20.2p to 23.8p. The interim
dividend of 16.5p (8.75p) is equivalent in size to the 1992 final dividend
and is being paid earlier than usual. Burmah said no decision had yet been
taken on the size of this year's final.
The enhanced scrip dividend is worth 24.75p and BZW is offering to pay
24.255p cash for each share issued under the offer. Burmah said it would
seek shareholder approval for the scheme. This would also enable it to offer
an enhanced scrip final dividend, but no decision had yet been taken to do
so.
Net gearing, counting Burmah's convertible capital bond as debt, fell from
65 per cent to 63 per cent. Burmah said that if the enhanced scrip dividend
was taken up in full, net gearing would fall by some 10 points and earnings
per share this year would be improved by 4p.
Mr Urquhart said performance from the group's core divisions next year would
benefit from the move into profit of Castrol Syntec, Burmah's synthetic
motor oil, and the Foseco metallurgical chemicals would benefit from a
continuing cost reduction programme.
Burmah has adopted the latest accountancy standard on the treatment of
profits from hyper-inflationary economies - which in the group's case mainly
means Brazil. It said this had reduced profits after tax and minorities by
Pounds 1.7m and would reduce full-year profits by about Pounds 9m.
Burmah said volumes and gross margins in its Castrol lubricants division
increased in spite of lower market demand, with operating profits up by 15
per cent to Pounds 70.8m. Operating profits in chemicals rose 5 per cent to
Pounds 17.8m despite the severe impact of European recession on the
metallurgical division.
COMMENT
The market liked the enhanced scrip dividend, but the underlying operational
performance is even more impressive. Managing to enhance Castrol's volumes
and margins in the current climate is no mean feat, particularly in
continental Europe. The metallurgical businesses of Foseco, bought for
Pounds 260m at the end of 1990, continue to face dire markets, but the group
has moved swiftly to reduce costs, closing large plants in France and Spain.
Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 100m put the shares on a prospective
multiple of 15.3. The shares have had a good run, nearly doubling within two
years, but do not look overvalued even at this level.
