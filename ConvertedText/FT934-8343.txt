FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland flotation plans scuppered


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PLANS to float Swithland Group, the Midlands-based new and used car
retailer, have lapsed after an attempt to place the company's shares with
institutions failed.
The shares were priced at 81p each and the company would have been valued at
about Pounds 21m.
The placing was not underwritten.
It was conditional on a minimum of 48 per cent of 18.5m shares to be placed,
or 67 per cent of the 26.4m total share capital, being placed by November
12.
It is not known how many shares were placed.
The company could not be reached yesterday but former sponsors, Ionian
Corporate Finance, said: 'The position is that Swithland Group has withdrawn
its application to the London Stock Exchange for the ordinary share capital
to be admitted to the Official List.'
Swithland will issue a statement in due course. Ionian added that it had
ceased to act for Swithland Group.
It is thought that adverse press comment about the company is being blamed
for the lack of institutional interest in the stock.
