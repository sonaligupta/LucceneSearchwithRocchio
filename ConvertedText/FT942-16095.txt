   By JOHN MURRELL


Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, the environmental and
property services group, made Pounds 2.83m on the exercise of options over
1.65m shares last April, according to the company's report and accounts.
The exercise lifted Mr Thompson's holding in Rentokil to 2.8m shares, which
was worth Pounds 6.5m at yesterday's close of 231p.
The chief executive has options over a further 2.1m shares at an average
exercise price of 86.47p. This entitlement has an intrinsic value of Pounds
1.82m.
The accounts showed that his remuneration last year fell from Pounds 707,000
to Pounds 658,000. Some 37.9 per cent of his package is accounted for by
incentive payments. Mr Thompson is also on the boards of Wellcome, Caradon,
Farepak, Royal Dutch Shell and Boots.
