FT  16 DEC 94 / Major in row over early Christmas recess


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


An intended goodwill gesture turned sour on Mr John Major yesterday when he
was accused of bringing forward the Christmas parliamentary recess to dodge
a political roasting in the Commons.
In a rare display of public anger, the prime minister vigorously denied that
the earlier break was caused by a desire to avoid a testing question time.
MPs will start their Christmas break on Tuesday instead of Wednesday.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow leader of the Commons, said the scrapping of the
business originally planned for Tuesday would enable the prime minister to
escape a question time session. Mr Major was further angered by her
suggestion that he was resigned to the loss of the Dudley West by-election
and wanted to deprive Mr Ian Pearson, the Labour candidate, of a
high-profile introduction to the Commons on Tuesday.
After an animated conversation with the prime minister, Mr Tony Newton,
leader of the Commons, said MPs ought to know that the recess had been
brought forward a day in response to a request from the office of Mr Tony
Blair, the Labour leader.
After hurried consultations with other members of the Labour front bench Mrs
Taylor insisted that Mr Blair had not requested an earlier start for the
Christmas recess.
She pressed for the reinstatement of prime minister's questions and the
other business planned for Tuesday.
Mr Newton admitted in conciliatory tones that there could have been a
misunderstanding. 'Manifestly the impression had been created in Mr Major's
office that something approaching a request had been made,' he said.
