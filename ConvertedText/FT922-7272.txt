FT  19 MAY 92 / UK Company News: South Staffs' 36% advance boosts shares


   By PETER PEARSE


Shares in South Staffordshire Water Holdings leapt 62p to 905p last Friday
as the water utility revealed a 36 per cent advance in profits for the year
to March 31. The shares continued their rise yesterday, putting on a further
28p to close at 933p.
The pre-tax surplus of Pounds 8.74m (Pounds 6.43m) was struck on turnover 11
per cent ahead at Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 43.4m).
Mr Edwin Thompson, chairman, said the company's strong financial performance
over the year had enabled it to restrict the increase in charges to below
the maximum available for both domestic and commercial customers.
The final dividend is 26.7p, which together with the average statutory
dividend and the interim, makes 40.2p for the year - covered 3.7 times by
earnings of 148p (104p).
