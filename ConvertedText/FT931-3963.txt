FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Airlines downgraded by S&P


   By NIKKI TAIT


STANDARD & Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, yesterday downgraded
senior debt securities at the three largest US airlines to speculative grade
 -or 'junk bond' - status.
S&P said that it was lowering its rating on the senior debt securities of
United Airlines' parent, UAL, to double-B from triple-B-minus; lowering
AMR's senior debt to double-B-plus from triple-B; and cutting the rating on
Delta Air Lines' senior debt from from triple-B-minus to double-B.
Various other debt securities issued by the 'big three' US carriers were
also downgraded by the rating agency, and in total approximately Dollars
5.7bn-worth of securities were affected by the rating agency's changes.
S&P said that the downgrades were based on 'an adverse industry environment
and a narrowed competitive advantage over second-tier airlines'.
It pointed to the continued overcapacity in the sector, the encroachment of
foreign carriers into the US airline industry, and the persistence of weak
demand due to the slow economic recovery in the US and the recession in
Europe.
It also noted that many of the weaker carriers have been winning wage
concessions from employees, driving down their cost structures and giving
them an operating advantage against the big three.
The big three US carriers last night issued a pre-emptive response on
rumours that the US Department of Transportation may be poised to approve
the British Airways-USAir code-sharing agreement.
They said they were 'enormously disappointed that the Clinton
Administration's first aviation policy decision could give a permanent and
unfair advantage to foreign carriers over US carriers without requiring
reciprocal concessions by the UK'.
