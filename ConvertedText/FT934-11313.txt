Early retirement and increasing use of disability benefits have
substantially lowered the average number of years Dutch people work, the
statistics bureau said yesterday, Reuter reports from Voorburg, Netherlands.
Men of 80 years and older have worked an average 49 years of their life
while men aged 65-69 have spent 42 years working. For women the scores are
38 and 33 years.
