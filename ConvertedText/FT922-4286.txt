FT  06 JUN 92 / Out of step with the people: Politicians have failed to sell
the Maastricht Treaty


   By DAVID MARSH


A shock wave surged across Europe this week, sending a disruptive wash in
several directions at once. The narrow anti-Maastricht vote in the Danish
referendum has splintered the convoy of EC members on their journey towards
ratification of the European union treaty.
It has focused attention on an apparent lack of democratic backing for the
goal of greater European integration proclaimed at the EC summit in the
Netherlands six months ago. And it has added to domestic difficulties of
several governments - notably in Germany and France - at the centre of the
Maastricht process.
The Danish mood finds an echo in other states where government policies on
Europe are falling foul of disenchanted electorates. The squalls unleashed
by the Danish 'No' are, however, clearly not just about European
integration. Voters are showing discontent over European policies partly, it
seems, as a means of expressing wider irritation with the political parties
which govern them.
'This was less a vote against Europe, more a vote against the politicians,'
said a Danish diplomat this week. The Danes - traditional Euro-sceptics -
threw out policies which had the backing of most of the Danish political and
corporate establishment. The diplomat singled out his own boss for blame. He
said that over-insistent pro-Europe campaigning by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
the foreign minister, may have added to Danes' desire to teach the
politicians a lesson.
Officially, at least, the other EC states are brushing aside the Danish veto
almost as though nothing had happened. Foreign Ministers have agreed to
steam ahead with ratification, hoping to rope the Danes back on board later
on. None the less, the politicians can hardly afford to ignore the flare-up
of Euro-mutiny - unless they want to end up together on the rocks.
During the months before the Maastricht agreement in December last year,
there was in most EC countries astonishingly little public debate on the
exact nature of the institutional and economic changes planned by the EC.
Now, as the Danish referendum result helps bring anti-Maastricht feeling out
into the open elsewhere, the people's voice is starting to be heard. 'The
whole thing could become a catalyst,' says Mr Gordon Heald, managing
director of the UK arm of the Gallup opinion survey company, an experienced
hand in Euro-polling.
One member of a government clearly rocked by Tuesday's vote is Mr Ulf
Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for European affairs, who is in charge of
negotiating Sweden's application for EC membership. 'This was a warning
light for the politicians. What happened in Denmark showed that the
politicians are not fully in touch with the people,' he says. Showing how
Denmark's 'No' is reverberating well beyond its borders, Mr Dinkelspiel
points out how Swedish opinion polls at the end of this week showed a sharp
anti-EC swing. Although he believes such opposition will be overcome,
Stockholm's bid to join the Community, like those of Austria, Finland and
other countries may now be held up.
As far as their general views on Europe are concerned, the public across the
continent - in an inevitably diffuse way - seem to be expressing two broad
messages. People appear generally satisfied with the achievements of the
European Community so far. But they favour a slowdown in further changes
while they digest those which are taking place already. The Community's
regular 'Eurobarometer' of public opinion across the 12 members has shown a
steady increase in general support for the Community. An overall 69 per cent
of EC populations believe that Community is a 'good thing', according to the
latest poll at the end of last year against 60 per cent in 1985 and only 56
per cent in 1973, when Britain joined. The percentage of Britons in favour
has risen from 31 per cent in 1973 and 24 per cent in 1980 to 57 per cent
last year.
On the 'widening' and 'deepening' of the Community implicit in the
Maastricht process, the picture is different. Here, anxieties come to the
surface - for a mixture of motives. Worries about the cost of embracing the
poorer southern states, as well as, later, the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe, play a part. So do fears about falling barriers
to industrial and agricultural competition, and about a lack of democracy in
Community institutions. Last year, 27 per cent of those surveyed said they
were either 'rather fearful or very fearful' about the 'single market',
which comes into effect on January 1 1993, against only 22 per cent in 1988.
Additionally, as the chart shows, support for 'unification of western
Europe' has dropped in recent years in the richer countries which believe
they will have to pay for it.
At a time when established parties across the EC have been suffering falling
electoral support, the Danish rejection adds to governments' difficulties in
winning popular support for Maastricht ratification. One of the few
countries where the Copenhagen 'No' has not caused tremors is Italy -
reflecting the media's understandable preoccupation with the imbroglio over
attempts to form a new government. In Britain, where the pre-Maastricht
discussion was more vociferous than elsewhere, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, faces a revolt from Tory backbenchers on his European policies. In
France, where the popular mood remains heavily in favour of the Maastricht
treaty, President Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday announced a referendum on
the issue, scheduled to be held in the autumn. Most ominously for
Maastricht-backers, public opinion in Germany seems to be swinging against
the treaty. This partly reflects German worries about abandoning the D-Mark
as part of European monetary union. Many Germans also fear that the proposed
political union will be too far removed from parliamentary control, and will
contravene Germany's principles of sharing power with the federal states.
The basic reasons for German Euro-scepticism may not be all that different
from those which have always existed elsewhere. The doubts are however
coming to the surface in the country which has always, along with France,
provided the motor for integration. So these new German misgivings,
potentially at least, have considerable greater explosive power than the
small blast in Copenhagen which captured all the attention this week.
'The Germans are worried about the pace (of integration),' says Prof
Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, the head of the Allensbach Institute and the
doyenne of European opinion pollsters. 'Decisions are being forced through
too fast.' Ms Noelle-Neumann a confidante of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, points
out that the drive towards European union was intensified in 1989-90. This
was the result of a Franco-German initiative to show that, in spite of
German unification, Germany would remain a 'good European.' Now, with the
costs of unifying their own country much higher than expected, Allensbach
surveys show a growing number of Germans want to slow European union while
Germany copes with its own national challenge.
Only 18 per cent of the population, according to an Allensbach poll earlier
this year, believe a single European currency would be as stable as the
D-Mark. Some members of the Opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) have
this week called for a German referendum on Maastricht. If such a referendum
were held tomorrow, Ms Noelle-Neumann says, she would be 'uncertain' whether
Mr Kohl would receive a 'Yes' vote.
Mr Gunther Nonnenmacher, foreign editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, the conservative German daily newspaper, laments the lack of a
suitable forum in which German doubts about European policies can be
properly aired. 'There has never been a proper debate, either within the
parties, or between them,' Mr Nonnenmacher says. He believes that the Danish
vote may prompt a 'bandwagon' effect in Germany. An initial indication that
this may be happening was a hastily conducted opinion survey carried out
this week in which an astonishing 81 per cent of respondents said they
opposed the treaty.
One reason for such a result is that public opinion in all EC countries is
becoming much more volatile, says Mr Nonnenmacher. 'This is mixed up with
general antipathy against politicians, against the political class, and
against bureaucrats.' There is clear evidence of this trend, too, in France.
Mr Francois Cornut-Gentille, assistant director of political polling at the
Sofres opinion research organisation in Paris, notes that the Maastricht
Treaty is backed by the leaders of nearly all the mainstream political
parties, as well as most of the French media. The treaty is normally given
sizeable majorities in opinion surveys.
None the less, pro-European sentiment is both 'reserved' and 'ambiguous' he
says. 'This is partly because much of the Maastricht legislation is very
difficult to understand.' Alongside worries on questions like sovereignty,
'there is a confusion about where we are going,' he says. Mr Cornut-Gentille
adds that, like in Germany, 'The debate has never been given a real
content.'
This fluidity of French opinion carries clear risks for President
Mitterrand, who has slid down the opinion polls in recent months. A poll in
the Parisien newspaper on Thursday showed a 2 to 1 majority in favour of
Maastricht. But 42 per cent of those asked said they would abstain in the
forthcoming French referendum, or were undecided. Mr Mitterrand has called
the referendum chiefly to expose a split over Maastricht in the Right-wing
opposition. It is likely that Mr Mitterrand's ploy will succeed. Yet he is
also taking a risk. If the referendum is interpreted not only as a decision
on Europe, but also as a vote of confidence in the presidency, then the
referendum 'might incite the opposite of what the President wants,' Mr
Cornut-Gentille says.
As Europe ponders the fall-out, the Danish vote has demonstrated one very
real success of European integration. Trends in public opinion cannot be
confined to one country, but leap instantly across borders. The Danish
referendum, and its aftermath, underscores voters' mistrust of politicians
as much as it does their mistrust of a federal Europe. But if the people
cannot trust the politicians, who else is there to lead them towards an
integrated, stable and prosperous continent?
