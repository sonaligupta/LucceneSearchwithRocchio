FT  30 MAR 92 / Japanese by-election gives boost to LDP

JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday won two parliamentary
seats in a hard-fought by-election contest in Gunma Prefecture, a rural
constituency to the north-west of Tokyo.
The LDP's victory in the lower-house by-election comes after two consecutive
losses in by-elections for the upper house of the Diet (parliament) earlier
this year. Those losses were sharp setbacks for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the
prime minister, and his scandal-ridden gov-ernment.
The by-elections are an important barometer of voter sentiment ahead of
elections in July for the upper house. Many observers had all but written
off the LDP's chances of regaining its majority in the upper house.
Preliminary results last night put the two LDP candidates ahead by a
convincing margin.
It was the turn of the Socialists, the largest opposition party, for
embarrassment. The party has also been plagued by scandal recently and
voters vented their anger against Mrs Toshie Sunaga, widow of the former
representative from the district.
The LDP victory boosts by a single vote the party's majority in the lower
house of the diet (parliament).
More importantly, it could serve to raise morale in advance of the upper
house elections. The LDP's inability to command a majority in the upper
house has made it more difficult to push through controversial legislation.
Mr Miyazawa's popularity has dropped steadily since he took office last
November. A poll published last week put his approval rating at just 26.5
per cent, compared to 55.7 per cent four months ago.
