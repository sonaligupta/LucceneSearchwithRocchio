FT  29 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: S&P raises credit rating on
The Equitable


   By NIKKI TAIT


   NEW YORK


STANDARD & Poor's, the Wall Street rating agency, has raised its credit
rating on The Equitable, the large US life insurer, from A to A+. The
upgrade follows the insurer's conversion from mutual status, where it was
controlled by its policyholders, to a conventional shareholder-owned
company.
During the process, the insurer sold shares to investors - about Dollars
110m will be added to capital as a result - and received a further Dollars
1bn capital infusion from Axa, the large French insurer.
As a result Axa now holds a 49 per cent stake in The Equitable.
