FT  21 OCT 92 / Iraq bans import of luxuries


   By REUTER


   BAGHDAD


IRAQ, struggling to prop up its sinking dinar after more than two years of
sanctions, yesterday stopped importing luxury goods and told traders to
clear them from their shelves by November 20, Reuter reports from Baghdad.
The import ban, which was announced in August by President Saddam Hussein,
came into operation on a list of 157 items from cheese to personal
computers. Only essential items may still be imported.
