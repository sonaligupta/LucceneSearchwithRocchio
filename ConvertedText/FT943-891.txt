FT  27 SEP 94 / Cleaning up its act to fight the giants: Roderick Oram
explains why Reckitt & Colman is spending Pounds 1bn to build its US
household products portfolio


   By RODERICK ORAM


Mustard, barbecue sauce and potatoes were all Reckitt & Colman was selling
in the US 10 years ago. Two acquisitions turned it into a provider of
cleaners and other household products, making the US the British group's
largest single market. But it remained a second-tier company lacking some
key products in a field dominated by leading brands.
Reckitt's ambition, though, is to compete with the likes of
Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble on their US home ground, by far the
largest market in the world, and abroad. Yesterday's Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds
1bn) purchase of L&F Household from Eastman Kodak gives it the weapons to
take them on. It may also hasten the day when Reckitt concentrates entirely
on household products by selling its over-the-counter drugs including such
famous brands as Disprin, an aspirin-based painkiller.
L&F 'fits our strategy perfectly,' said Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive.
'It transforms the position and profitability of our US business.' According
to Mr Paul Woodhouse, a Smith New Court analyst: 'Reckitt was in need of
something to get it moving. It was in the second division with few products
mass marketers needed.'
But L&F also presents Reckitt with some stiff challenges. The biggest is to
assimilate L&F and use its brands and technology to good effect abroad.
Reckitt has a rather patchy record on these management techniques. It has
yet to maximise the potential, for example, of its Dollars 1.25bn purchase
in 1990 of Boyle Midway, another US household products group. The group has
found it hard to increase US sales and profits in recent years.
Founded in 1874 by Mr Lane and Mr Fink as an importer of raw materials for
New York City pharmacists, L&F became one of the first suppliers of
antiseptics. From that technology grew a range of disinfectants and other
household products. It was taken over by Sterling Drug in 1966 which in turn
was bought by Kodak in 1988.
Its products are tightly focused on some six brands such as Lysol which are
first or second in their markets. It has products such as lavatory cleaners
which Reckitt lacks in the US. It has disinfectant technology that Reckitt
hopes to use elsewhere in the world. It is much more experienced in the US
than its new owner at 'controlling shelf space', the art of dealing with
retailers. Strength in brands and distribution helped it to achieve a profit
margin last year about 2 percentage points better than Reckitt's world wide
average of 15 per cent.
Lysol is a leading brand with its products used in two out of three US
homes. Sales of Lysol products totalled Dollars 360m last year, about half
L&F's sales, but only Dollars 30m came from outside the US. Moreover,
Lysol's annual sales growth of about 2.5 per cent in recent years has been
moderate and some US analysts see it as a 'tired brand'. Reckitt could play
to both the strengths and weaknesses of Lysol. It intends to rebuild its US
business around Lysol and L&F's other main brands by selling off lesser
products from the two companies. L&F's products generating less than 25 per
cent of sales could be sold, Mr Sankey said.
The new US line-up, including successful existing products such as Woolite
fabric washes and Easy-Off oven cleaners, will broaden the range of products
Reckitt offers retailers and allow it to make better use of its marketing
expenditure. Reckitt could also apply to Lysol its skill at extending the
range of brands and take it into new markets.
North American sales by Reckitt after the acquisition and related disposals
will be about Pounds 775m, about 35 per cent of the group total, compared
with Pounds 553m and 26 per cent now. Once integration is complete in 1997,
the synergies will be worth some Pounds 40m a year in operating profits in
addition to the money Reckitt and L&F are currently making, Mr Sankey said.
In a world increasingly dominated by large over-the-counter drugs companies,
Reckitt will be a small player. Mr Sankey said yesterday its drugs 'were a
very fine piece of business' both for its brands and growing penetration in
south-east Asia which it intended to exploit.
But the division could be worth some Pounds 500m to a big player, analysts
suggest. A sale would give Reckitt the resources to make further
acquisitions to build itself into a worldwide household products company.
