FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: BCE warns of loss at Nortel


   By AP-DJ


BCE of Canada has warned that Northern Telecom is likely to record an
operating loss for the 1994 first quarter, AP-DJ reports.
For Northern Telecom, 52 per cent owned by BCE, 'the effect of pricing
pressures, product mix, and traditionally lower first-quarter volume is
expected to have a significant impact on gross profit and will likely
generate an operating loss in the first quarter of 1994,' BCE says in its
annual report.
'The annualised effect of improvements in the cost structure and volume
growth from a strengthened portfolio of products is expected to become
evident in the second half of the year.'
BCE says its Bell Canada unit's earnings target for 1994 'is at the low end
of the 11 per cent to 12 per cent range of regulated rate of return' set by
Canadian authorities.
