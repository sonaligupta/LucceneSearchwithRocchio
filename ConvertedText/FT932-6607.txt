FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nippon Oil shares rise despite
fall in earnings

NIPPON Oil, Japan's largest petroleum distributor, announced a 1.6 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y43.3bn (Dollars 394m) for the year to March, and
blamed the yen's appreciation for the price cuts on its energy products.
Net profits dropped 6.9 per cent to Y30.6bn on sales of Y1,995.9bn, down 1.6
per cent. The company's shares, however, rose Y14 on the news to end at Y853
on the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday.
Earnings per share fell to Y25.35 from Y31.05 the year before.
Nippon Oil estimates pre-tax profits will fall by 7.6 per cent to Y40bn in
the current year, making a third consecutive annual decline. It expects
overall sales to inch up 0.2 per cent to Y2,000bn .
In response to Japan's economic environment, the company plans bond
redemptions by taking about Y100bn from its reserve funds, a move that
contributes to the lower profit forecasts.
Mitsubishi Oil, the Tokyo-based refiner and distributor, announced its
pre-tax profits rose 3.8 per cent to Y24.3bn in the year to March.
Net profits dropped 21.6 per cent to Y10.6bn, while total sales gained 6.7
per cent to Y1,111bn. The company estimates pre-tax profits will grow by 2.6
per cent to Y25bn this year.
