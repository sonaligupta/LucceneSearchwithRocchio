FT  30 JAN 92 / Iran 'took US military exports'


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


THE US Department of Commerce approved nearly Dollars 60m worth of
militarily useful US exports to Iran in the 12 months to last September,
including equipment that could help make nuclear weapons, says a report
released yesterday by the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms
Control.
Professor Gary Milhollin, project director, yesterday said the Commerce
Department had approved some of the licences, in spite of opposition from
the Defence and State Departments.
Restrictions applied to exports of militarily useful equipment to Iran
because of its status, under US export law, as a backer of terrorism.
The approvals were of dual-use equipment - items that could have civilian or
military applications. Hence, the shipments would not have been illegal.
A similar series of shipments of such dual-use equipment to Iraq occurred
after Commerce Department approval of exports between 1985 and 1990.
Prof Milhollin said that among the exports approved were items that could
clearly be used for the making and testing of nuclear weapons.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that it had not seen the Milhollin
report but wished to note that 'all of these licences were decided in
accordance with export control policies, following inter-agency review and
with Congress being informed.'
