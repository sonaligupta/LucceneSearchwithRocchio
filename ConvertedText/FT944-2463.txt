FT  16 DEC 94 / Dudley defeat worst since war


   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent


The Dudley West by-election will go down as the worst Conservative defeat
since the second world war.
The 29 per cent swing against the Conservatives cut their share of the vote
to just 19 per cent from 48.8 per cent in the 1992 general election.
Labour's vote, by contrast, increased to 69 per cent from 40.7 per cent in
the general election, and from its 59.5 per cent share of the vote in the
constituency at the local elections in May.
The defeat reduces the government's notional majority in the Commons to 13,
including the nine Tories who lost or resigned the whip two weeks ago after
a parliamentary rebellion on UK contributions to the European Union.
However, the willingness of the rebels to continue to vote against the
government means that Mr John Major now leads an administration with an
effective overall minority of five votes.
Even more worrying for Mr Major, if this result was repeated in a general
election it would result in the loss of most Conservative seats in the
Commons - raising the prospect of a Canadian-style Tory wipe-out.
Mr David Butler, the leading psephologist, calculates that every
Conservative MP would be defeated on a uniform national swing of 25 per
cent. Even a 20 per cent swing would defeat all but 12 Tories.
The swing last night will be a severe blow to ministers, whose authority has
been battered by recent revolts on value added tax and fishing policy, and
by the struggle to cope with a deep split on Europe.
Although lower than the record anti-Conservative swing of 35 per cent at
Christchurch, won by the Liberal Democrats in July 1983, it equalled
Labour's second-highest ever swing.
The victory was in the same league as the famous inter-war Labour victories
at Liverpool Wavertree in 1935 and Fulham East in 1933, when the party
achieved swings of 30 per cent and 29 per cent respectively.
It significantly bettered the 21.5 per cent swing at Mid-Staffs in March
1990 - the biggest shift in support from the government to Labour in a
Tory-held seat since the Conservatives returned to power in 1979.
There were a few crumbs of comfort for the government. The scale of the
defeat was undoubtedly reduced by the low turnout, which fell to 47 per cent
from 82.1 per cent in the 1992 general election - probably with
disillusioned Tories staying at home.
