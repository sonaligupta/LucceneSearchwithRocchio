FT  25 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard attacks 'unwelcome' Pounds 59m
bid


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SECURIGUARD, the security and cleaning services company, has again dismissed
the hostile Pounds 59.2m bid made last week by Rentokil Group, the
environmental and property services company.
Securiguard said it was 'unimpressed' by Rentokil's offer document,
delivered to shareholders yesterday.
Mr Alan Baldwin, chairman of Securiguard, said the offer was 'unwelcome and
inadequate'. He said the cash offer price of 270p a share was not 'anywhere
near' an acceptable price.
The 270p a share offer represented a 46 per cent premium to Securiguard's
closing price on Monday of 185p. Following Securiguard's rejection last
week, its shares closed 19p above the offer price at 289p, and closed
yesterday up 4p at 296p.
In a letter to Securiguard shareholders, Mr David Newbigging, chairman of
Rentokil, repeated the company's offer to meet with Mr Baldwin.
Except for a phone call on the morning the bid was launched, there has been
no contact between the two sides.
The understated tone of Rentokil's offer document, and both sides' refusal
so far to criticise their opponents, has prompted some observers to comment
that the bid has the flavour of a recommended rather than a hostile offer.
