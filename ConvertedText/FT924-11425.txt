FT  26 OCT 92 / International Company News: Agreement to save Fokker step
closer

DEUTSCHE Aerospace of Germany is near a definitive agreement with the Dutch
government that would pull cash-strapped Fokker, the Dutch aircraft maker,
out of financial difficulties, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam.
Sources said over the weekend that all the parties on Friday reached an
informal consensus over key terms for the transaction.
The definitive agreement for the takeover is understood to involve DASA
paying between Fl 35 and Fl 40 a share for the 10.6m Fokker shares held by
the government, and 13.2m shares it would buy directly from Fokker through a
private placement.
There were suggestions in European aerospace industry circles that DASA
would end up paying around Fl 37, well above Fokker's closing price of Fl
15.80 a share on the Amsterdam exchange on Friday.
At that price, the deal would be worth around Fl 880m (Dollars 510m); in
July, Fokker expected well over Fl 1bn.
The Dutch state owns nearly 32 per cent of the bourse-listed Fokker and has
around Fl 1.8bn of further exposure to the company via development credits
and loan guarantees.
