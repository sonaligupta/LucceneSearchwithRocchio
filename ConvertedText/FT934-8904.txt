FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed welcome for Shell


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


THE MARKET'S recent love affair with Shell Transport, which took the shares
up to a record 724p, was halted yesterday after the oil group announced
third-quarter results broadly in line with expectations. 'The stock market
is a very fickle place at present, and there is nothing wrong with these
numbers except that the super optim-ists have been marginally disappointed,'
said one sector specialist.
He said the oil sector had possibly been carried away on a sea of optimism
prompted by BP's recent excellent figures and those of the US majors.
Some of the market's more enthusiastic analysts, and specifically many of
those in the Netherlands, had pencilled in a net income forecast on a
replacement cost basis of Pounds 900m for the period. The actual figure came
out at Pounds 861m, at the top end of most UK forecasts.
Among the market bulls, Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull described the
results as 'operationally good' and said he remained 'more than happy with
the shares', noting the positive points, such as gearing of only 3.8 per
cent and cash reserves of Pounds 6.7bn. Of the more cautious brokers, Mr
Nicholas Clayton at Nomura said: 'The long-term bull case for Shell remains
intact, but the shares look well up with events.'
Mr Fergus MacLeod at NatWest Securities commented: 'After outperformance of
25 per cent against a similar stock like Exxon this summer, driven by UK
optimism on these issues and dislike of BP, they are vulnerable to even mild
disappointments; our recommendation remains hold/underperform.'
At the close, Shell was 18 lower at 704p, with turnover of 10m the highest
single day's trade since May.
