   By REUTER


   BEIRUT


Four ministers boycotted the first meeting of Lebanon's new cabinet
yesterday, ramming home a crisis of confidence over its ability to revive a
war-shattered economy, Reuter reports from Beirut. The Lebanese pound
plunged to close at a record official low of LPounds 1,650 to the dollar,
4.8 per cent down from Friday, as Mr Rashid al-Solh's Syrian-backed cabinet
convened.
