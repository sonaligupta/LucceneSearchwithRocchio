FT  12 NOV 92 / Wales wins more foreign cash


WALES consistently won a greater share of foreign direct investment than any
other part of Britain during the 1980s in terms of jobs created and new
projects, according to a survey by Cardiff Business School.
Scotland came second in terms of jobs and third in terms of projects. The
north of England was third for jobs and second for projects, while the
south-east of England did particularly badly.
