FT  15 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: Mowlem clinches Pounds 50m station
deal


JOHN MOWLEM has won a Pounds 50m build contract from London Underground as
part of the Jubilee Line extension.
The company will construct the surface section of the line from Canning Town
to Stratford, new stations at Canning Town and West Ham and part of a new
interchange station at Stratford.
Work also requires the demolition of a number of existing buildings on the
site, culverting of a section of the Channelsea River, preparation of cable
routes for signalling and power supply equipment, construction of track
drainage, new retaining walls and acoustic barriers.
The Canning Town station will handle British Rail's North London Line,
Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee Line extension. The structure has to
be built on a constricted site between the DLR and BR's North London Line,
with 132 kva electricity cables for the national grid running overhead.
The DLR platforms will be above those for the Jubilee Line and there will be
an underground ticket hall giving access to all platforms. Mowlem is to
build a new bus station with subway links to the station and a riverside
walkway.
Consultants for the project are Kenchington Ford and Mason Pittendrigh. Work
starts November for completion in summer 1997.
