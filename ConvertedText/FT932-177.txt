FT  30 JUN 93 / Corporate fraud rises sharply


   By ANDREW JACK


CORPORATE FRAUD has risen sharply to more than Pounds 571m in the first four
months of 1993, according to figures compiled by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
accountancy firm, Andrew Jack writes.
Its 'fraud barometer', which catalogues press reports of UK criminal fraud
charges exceeding Pounds 100,000, shows there have been 355 cases involving
a total of Pounds 2.2bn since 1987.
Nearly 60 per cent of fraud since last year has been committed by top
management, 13 per cent by middle management and 22 per cent by employees.
In the first third of this year, the figure of Pounds 571m included Pounds
489m in charges connected to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The total figure for last year was Pounds 671m.
Of the other 13 cases detected in 1993, nearly half were brought against
lawyers or accountants and the average charge was Pounds 6.3m.
Over the last seven years, more than one third of fraudsters charged were
aged between 41 and 50, and a further 30 per cent were between 31 and 40.
