FT  13 NOV 92 / Ecu8bn loan to Italy under review

   BRUSSELS


THE European Community's Monetary Committee will vet the terms of an Ecu8bn
(Dollars 9.9bn) loan to Italy when it meets next week, Reuter reports from
Brussels.
The Committee will examine a proposal from the European Commission that the
balance of payments loan to prop up Italy's economy should be split into
four equal parts spread over three years, EC sources said.
At present the conditions attached to the loan concentrate mainly on
periodic reviews of the progress of Italy's budgetary programme, but the
Monetary Committee can suggest further conditions if it deems it necessary.
If, as expected, the Monetary Committee approves the loan, it will go to the
November 23 meeting of EC finance ministers for their final decision.
When Italy applied for the loan in early October it implied that approval
would help speed re-entry of the lira to the exchange rate mechanism which
it left under intense speculative pressure in mid-September.
At the time Prime Minister Giuliano Amato said approval of the loan was
likely to be conditional on the government pushing through a 1993 budget
which sets a target of L93,000bn (Dollars 68.5bn) in savings.
