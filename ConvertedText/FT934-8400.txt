FT  16 NOV 93 / Labour upset by Mirror health offer


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE LABOUR party's traditionally close relationship with the Daily Mirror
newspaper was undermined yesterday after Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow
health secretary, criticised it for promoting private health insurance.
His attack came after the Mirror sponsored a Pounds 10m promotion of private
health schemes in yesterday's edition. Readers were invited to apply for one
of a range of policies.
He said that the Daily Mirror was playing into the government's hands by
scaring people into believing that they could no longer trust the National
Health Service.
Mr Blunkett said: 'Ten million pounds used in the NHS would do a lot more
good than building future profits for private insurers.' He planned to take
the paper to the Advertising Standards Authority.
The paper said in the article accompanying the offer: 'The Mirror has always
been proud of the NHS. We have been in the front line of the battle to save
and improve it. We will go on doing that.'
