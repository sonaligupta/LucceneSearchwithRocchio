FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Digital seeks a successor to
Shingles


   By ALAN CANE


MR Geoffrey Shingles, who has been at the head of Digital Equipment's UK
subsidiary since 1968, announced yesterday that he will give up the role of
chief executive from the beginning of next year.
But he will continue as chairman, a position he has combined with chief
executive for the past two years.
A successor is now being sought and is expected to be in post by the middle
of next year. Mr Shingles, 53, said the company was starting with no
preconceived ideas about his replacement, who could come from within the
company or from outside. But it was likely that the eventual choice would
have extensive operation experience with a modern, high technology industry.
Mr Shingles is the longest-serving head of any large UK information
technology company.
His change of role is the latest in a series of senior management changes,
including the retirement of founder and chairman Mr Kenneth Olsen and the
resignation of European head Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, which are reshaping
Digital Equipment world-wide.
Mr Shingles said his move had been planned for some time and was not a
disappointed reaction to the appointment of Mr Richard Poulsen as head of
Europe.
As chairman he intends to concentrate on developing relationships with
Digital's customers in industry and Government.
