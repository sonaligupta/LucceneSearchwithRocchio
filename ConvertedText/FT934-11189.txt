FT  02 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Writer Michael Frayn is a great fan of Prague and he manages to excite our
interest in the city in Omnibus: Magic Lantern (BBC 1, 10.20). The Czech
capital has escaped extensive war damage, and Communist poverty has further
hindered re-development.
The result is a city that is an architect's dream, with every historical
period well represented from the baroque to art nouveau.
More wholesome diversion is First Tuesday (ITV, 10.40). Johnny Kingdom is a
countryman who has spent his life on Exmoor. But he is modern enough to own
a video camera and has built up his record of the region. It will be a
treasure trove for a late 21st century historian.
This is National Library Week and Channel 4 is doing its bit with short
dramas from five works of fiction, Blow Your Mind (8.00). If you enjoy your
brief taster you will be directed to the local library for more. Among the
authors included are James Joyce and Edgar Allen Poe.
Big film of the night is that classic of Grand Guignol, Whatever happened to
Baby Jane? (BBC1, 11.20), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.
