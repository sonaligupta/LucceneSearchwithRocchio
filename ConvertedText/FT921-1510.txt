FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Woodchester advances 34% to IPounds 39.6m

WOODCHESTER Investments, the Dublin-based leasing and financial services
group, reported a 34 per cent growth in pre-tax profits from IPounds 29.6m
to IPounds 39.6m (Pounds 37m) for 1991.
The results included an exceptional gain of IPounds 3.3m from the disposal
of Pinnacle Insurance in the UK. The underlying trading profits increased by
a more modest 26 per cent. The results were broadly in line with market
expectations.
Gross rentals were up by 16 per cent to IPounds 377.5m (IPounds 324.3m),
while group assets rose from IPounds 1.08bn to IPounds 1.12bn.
The figures included a first time contribution from the Mercantile Credit
Company (Ireland), acquired from Barclays at the end of 1990.
Mr Craig McKinney, chairman, said: 'The result represents a considerable
achievement given the difficult conditions prevailing, in particular in the
UK.' He added that the group's consumer finance and leasing operations had
remained profitable in the UK despite the high level of insolvencies there.
The expansion of the equity base from 139m shares to 194m shares was largely
the result of Credit Lyonnais increasing its 29.8 per cent stake to 45 per
cent in January 1991, and a IPounds 12m rights issue the same month.
The group now has estimated cash of IPounds 80m, which together with a new
Pounds 85m syndicated loan facility arranged through Credit Lyonnais, gives
it a substantial war chest for new acquisitions.
A number of opportunities in the UK are being examined. Mr McKinney said:
'We will not be looking at anything with gross assets of anything less than
IPounds 200m'.
He added that although competitors in the Irish market had been dismantling
their UK leasing operations 'we believe it is short-sighted. The UK is
always going to be an important market . . . While we believe that 1992 will
be difficult, with our well developed infrastructure we are well positioned
to take advantage of any upturn in the UK economy'.
Meanwhile, the strategic acquisition of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent
of CLLE, Credit Lyonnais' European leasing activities, is moving forward. A
due diligence exercise of CLLE's subsidiaries is under way and the deal is
expected to be presented for shareholder approval 'within the next two
months'.
The incorporation of CLLE will double the group's core activity of
small-ticket leasing and for the first time give it a broad European spread.
In its domestic market, the group earlier this month finalised the
acquisition of UDT Bank. On a pro-forma balance sheet, including UDT at
October 31 1991, total assets now stand at IPounds 1.45bn.
From earnings per share of 17p (16.8p) a final dividend of 2.24p makes a
total of 3.75p (3.125p).
