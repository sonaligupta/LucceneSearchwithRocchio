FT  30 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Securicor ahead 27% despite flat outcome
from Cellnet


   By ANGUS FOSTER


SECURICOR, the security and communications group, yesterday announced a 27
per cent increase in profits despite flat results from Cellnet, its 40 per
cent owned mobile telephone network.
Pre-tax profits rose from a restated Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 28.9m in the six
months to March 31. The increase would have been a modest 7 per cent on a
pre-FRS 3 accounting basis.
Security Services, the 50.75 per cent owned subsidiary where most of the
group's operating companies are held, expanded profits 36 per cent to Pounds
20.1m (Pounds 14.7m).
Mr Christopher Shirtcliffe, finance director, described the overall results
as 'impressive'. Turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 317.6m, helped by
last year's acquisitions of Federal Express' UK parcel business
Cellnet's pre-tax contribution fell from Pounds 22.8m to Pounds 21.4m.
Profits were dented by marketing costs for the new Lifetime service,
launched six months ago. Neither Securicor nor BT, which owns the remaining
60 per cent of the network, has disclosed start up costs for Lifetime, which
has built up just over 100,000 subscribers.
The security division lifted profits from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 3.76m,
although the rise was flattered by prior year restructuring costs.
Parcels, which operates as Securicor Omega Express, increased profits 10 per
cent to Pounds 3.3m; but that stemmed from the Federal Express purchase and
the company said overcapacity in UK parcels meant margins were slipping.
Securicor's communications division, which excludes Cellnet and mainly
involves cellular retailing, continued to lose money because of its small
subscriber base, although losses were reduced from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds
2.4m.
Earnings, helped by a lower tax charge, increased 59 per cent to 14p (8.8p).
Earnings at Security Services almost doubled, again helped by a lower tax
charge, to 12.2p (6.3p).
Both companies raised their interim dividends by 10 per cent to 0.732p and
1.533p respectively.
COMMENT
Results at the top end of expectations sent Securicor's A shares up 11p to
645p. After a poor start to the year, the shares have added 15 per cent
since April as analysts became more sanguine about competition threats to
Cellnet from new entrants like Mercury. The threat remains, of course, and
its shadow can be seen in the unspecified start-up costs incurred to gain
market share for Lifetime. But for the longer term the shares are
underpinned by the eventual likelihood that BT will make Securicor the offer
it cannot refuse. Until then the company's managed businesses offer solid,
if unspectacular growth. Full year profits forecasts of Pounds 65m put the
shares on just under 21 times, which looks about right.
