FT  05 JUN 92 / Bonn seals Bundesbank reform deal


   By QUENTIN PEEL


   BONN


THE German government has reached a last-minute deal on reform of the
Bundesbank in a bid to ensure that the country's 16 federal Lander (states)
do not gain excessive control over the central bank.
However the plans, which would reduce the representation of the states on
the bank's governing council from 11 to nine, may remain in the balance
because of constitutional challenges.
The plan will be put to the vote today in the Bundesrat, the upper house of
the German parliament, in which the 16 states are represented. There it will
probably be rejected by a majority of the states, ruled by opposition Social
Democrats.
But the compromise should ensure the reform eventually becomes law: there
will not be a two-thirds majority against it. This means the Bundesrat
decision can be overturned by a simple majority in the directly-elected
Bundestag, the lower house, which the government controls.
The key change was an agreement that a new joint state bank will be formed
by Saxony and Thuringia, both part of the former East Germany, instead of
combining Thuringia with Hesse in the west, as originally planned. In all,
the state banks will combine to form nine new banks, instead of the present
11, and instead of an automatic increase to 16 to take in the new eastern
states.
