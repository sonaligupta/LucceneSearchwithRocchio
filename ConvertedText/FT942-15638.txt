A new series of Taking Liberties begins with allegations that a British
based multinational company has used legal chicanery to cheat employees and
their widows out of compensation for mesothelioma, an asbestos-related
disease. One of the company's workers, Doreen Percival, who now has the
disease, says that even if the expose comes too late to help her, 'It is
some sort of revenge for what they have done to us' (7.50 BBC2).
On C4 Jonathan Glancey begins a three-part series called Heaven, Hell And
Suburbia. According to Glancey 'The Englishman's home is less a castle than
a half-timbered, bay-windowed semi with a fanlight neo-Georgian door'. He is
not in favour of suburbs: 'They undermine cities, consume the countryside,
and bleed both dry'. Yet more and more people want to live in them (8.00).
I hesitate to label Class Act as 'formula drama' because that is a
pejorative phrase and this series works. Well, the opening episode did
anyway. Joanna Lumley is perfectly cast as the embattled Sloane ranger (9.00
ITV).
