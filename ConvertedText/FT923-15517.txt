FT  01 JUL 92 / Strike hits Bermuda tourism industry


   By LINDA BILMES


   HAMILTON, BERMUDA


BERMUDA'S ailing tourism industry has been hit hard by a week-long strike
called by the island's main union, the Bermuda Industrial Union (BIU). The
strike was triggered by the allegedly unfair dismissal of a black employee
of Bermuda Forwarders, a small freight forwarding company.
Buses, taxis shipping ferries, rubbish collection, dock loading, and some
hospital and construction services have been affected by the strike.
Picketers have been blocking access to the island' airport since Friday,
causing delays and five-hour traffic jams.
The strikers are demanding the reinstatement of the employee as well as 15
co-workers fired after walking out in sympathy.
The strike has been fuelled by an undercurrent of racial tension. The
island's population is more than 50 per cent black, and blacks comprise a
majority of BIU membership. Mr Ottiwell Simmons, MP, president of the BIU,
accuses the government of 'a concerted effort to break the union and destroy
its leadership'. On Monday, police arrested 15 prominent union leaders who
were picketing the airport, including the presidents of the port, hospital,
bus operators and lorry drivers' divisions.
The government has also obtained a Supreme Court injunction ordering public
employees back to work. The BIU vows to intensify the strike. Bermuda's
tourist industry, already battered by three consecutive years of recession,
fears that 3,500 unionised hotel workers will join the strike.
Premier Sir John Swan warned yesterday that 'there is a danger of very real
damage being done to the economy. We cannot allow visitors to this island to
be used as pawns in the dispute.'
