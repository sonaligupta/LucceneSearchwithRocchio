FT  02 JUL 92 / Hong Kong citizen's protest at evictions


An inhabitant of Hong Kong's Walled City throws a stone at police who were
trying to evict residents from their homes yesterday in the last phase of a
British colonial plan to clear the enclave in the heart of Kowloon. The
seven acres of the Walled City are to be turned into a park.
