FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: JAL unveils plan to increase
revenues

JAPAN Air Lines, the Japanese international carrier which last month
announced a loss for the year to the end of March, yesterday unveiled a
cost-cutting and revenue-boosting programme.
By increasing income from domestic operations, JAL hopes by the 1996-97
financial year to increase net revenues by Y100bn (Dollars 782m) a year. It
is planning a Y25bn pre-tax profit in 1996-97.
The company, hit by the recession in the airline industry and the slowdown
in the Japanese economy, is halving to 250 the number of employees it plans
to recruit in Japan next year.
JAL is scrapping plans to hire 900 extra ground staff, the number of
managers will be cut by 50 to 500 and around 30 overseas posts will be axed.
However, the airline intends to continue hiring cockpit crew.
Overall, employment will still rise, albeit more slowly than planned - from
22,100 now to 23,600 in 1996. Other proposals include transferring some
administrative and maintenance work overseas.
At the same time, JAL plans to increase its share in the lucrative Japanese
domestic market from 24 per cent to around one-third. It wants domestic
revenues to increase from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of total revenues and
intends to expand its network and to increase the frequency of flights.
