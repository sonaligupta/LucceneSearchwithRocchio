   NEW YORK


USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways plans to invest Dollars 750m
(Pounds 392m) for a potential 44 per cent stake, is among four companies
named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of two victims of the La Guardia crash in
March, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Twenty-seven passengers died when a USAir Fokker F28 veered off a runway on
March 22 at New York's La Guardia airport and ended up in the icy waters of
Flushing Bay.
The lawsuit, filed in northern Ohio, seeks a total of Dollars 80m in damages
from USAir, Fokker Aircraft USA, Dow Chemical and Rolls-Royce.
It alleges that Dow Chemical, which made the de-icer used on the plane, and
the other companies 'knew or should have known that the de-icer they were
using was not effective on this particular airplane in these circumstances'.
