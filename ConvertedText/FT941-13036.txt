FT  27 JAN 94 / Mercedes trucks heads for 1994 loss

Mr Helmut Werner, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading
truck maker, warned yesterday that the commercial vehicle operation would
suffer a third successive annual loss in 1994.
The car division, which also suffered an operating loss in 1993, was
expected to return to profit, helped by a forecast 12 per cent increase in
sales to 570,000.
Turnover at Mercedes-Benz, which accounts for about two-thirds of its parent
Daimler-Benz's total sales, was forecast to rise by 5 per cent this year to
DM68bn (Pounds 26bn). Daimler-Benz suffered a loss of DM2bn in the first
nine months of 1993 under US accounting rules.
Mr Werner said that Mercedes-Benz had embarked on a 'radical rethinking' of
its production structure. It was planning to:
increase the share of car production outside Germany to 10 per cent in the
medium term from only 2 per cent, in such countries as the US, Mexico, South
Korea and India. It expected to sign shortly a deal with Tata, the Indian
vehicle maker, to assemble up to 15,000 E-Class cars a year from 1995.
cut the level of in-house manufacturing from 45 per cent to less than 40 per
cent by 1998 by making greater use of outside components suppliers.
enter more co-operative ventures with other vehicle makers and suppliers.
Mercedes-Benz was also seeking to improve productivity. Capital spending was
being reduced to DM18.7bn in the five years to 1998 from the DM21bn
previously planned for the five years to 1997.
'We shall be able to achieve more with our available funds than in the past.
High investment expenditure is not always a sign of efficient performance,'
said Mr Werner. Research and development spending was also being cut by
DM1bn to DM16bn between the two planning periods, although spending on
product development was being increased by DM1bn.
Capital productivity had fallen steadily in recent years leading to 'a
dramatic increase in depreciation', said Mr Werner. 'We have to deploy our
investment more efficiently.' The company had cut its costs by DM4bn in 1993
alone and planned to close the present cost gap with Japanese producers by
1998. Mercedes-Benz cut 14,700 jobs from its domestic workforce in 1992,
some 11,000 last year and planned to cut a further 8,000 jobs this year to
give a total of 151,000 by the end of 1994. The German vehicle industry
overall cut 70,000 jobs last year, said Mr Werner.
