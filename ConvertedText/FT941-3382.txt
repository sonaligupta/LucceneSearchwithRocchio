FT  16 MAR 94 / International Company News: SGS advance curtailed by SFr27m
restructuring charge

   GENEVA


Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Swiss inspection and insurance loss
adjusting group, reported a 1.3 per cent rise in net income in 1993 to
SFr196.1m (Dollars 91m) in spite of a SFr27.2m exceptional charge for
discontinued activities.
Earnings per share grew faster, 7.15 per cent, to SFr22.02 per registered
share and SFr110.10 per bearer share, due to the successful campaign last
year to buy back for cancellation 5 per cent of the share capital. The
directors have recommended a 7 per cent rise in dividends.
Mrs Elisabeth Salina Amorini, SGS chairman, said the group looked forward to
the current year 'with confidence', expecting that the effects of internal
restructuring and the economic recovery in the US and the UK would boost
profits. Mr Serge Pahud, finance director, said no further restructuring
charges were expected this year.
Revenues last year were up 6.8 per cent to SFr2.6bn, thanks to 6.3 per cent
of internal growth, 1.5 per cent from acquisitions and a negative 1 per cent
from exchange rate adjustments. Operating income advanced 8.9 per cent to
SFr237.4m.
Mr Thierry Chereau, chief executive, said brisk business in Asia, Africa and
Latin America offset sluggish performances in Europe and North America.
Revenues from European countries were flat at SFr1.19bn, with growth in
eastern European countries preventing a decline. Revenues from North America
were up 9 per cent to SFr648.6m while income from the Asia-Pacific region
advanced 11.1 per cent to SFr562.7m.
Net financial revenues eased only marginally to SFr59m, in spite of the
downward trend of interest rates last year, but pre-tax profits dropped 1.8
per cent to SFr269.2m because of the restructuring charges.
