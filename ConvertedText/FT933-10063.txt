FT  06 AUG 93 / Baseball strikes out in trust case


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


A US judge yesterday rejected the argument of the owners of America's
professional baseball teams that their sport should remain exempt from US
anti-trust laws.
The lawsuit had been brought by two Pennsylvania businessman prevented by
other baseball owners from buying the San Francisco Giants team last year
and moving it to Florida.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1922 that the sport was not 'interstate
commerce', and thus not subject to anti-trust legislation, which prohibits
unregulated business monopolies. A series of court cases since have upheld
the decision.
Yesterday's ruling, however, is the most serious challenge yet to baseball's
exemption. US district court judge John Padova ruled that baseball's
exemption relates only to players' contracts, not to the buying and selling
of teams.
Anti-trust exemption has allowed owners to join forces to determine all the
big issues that affect baseball, such as the ownership of teams, the moving
of teams, and the negotiation of highly lucrative television contracts.
In March, a bill was introduced in the Senate that would end the sport's
immunity from anti-trust laws. Congressional critics argue that baseball is
no longer a sport run by owners in the public interest, but a sport run
purely for profit.
