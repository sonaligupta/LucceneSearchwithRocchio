FT  23 NOV 92 / Engineers draw up plan to end recession


   By ANDREW BAXTER


A PROGRAMME for lifting the UK out of the recession will be launched today
when the Engineering Employers' Federation announces its keenly awaited
proposals for an industrial strategy.
The EEF, which has 5,000 member companies and is the UK's largest federation
of engineering companies, will argue that greatly increased investment is
the key ingredient for economic success.
The foreword to the document, which has been hammered out over the past few
weeks as the troubles of the manufacturing sector deepen, paints a gloomy
picture of the UK industrial scene.
It says: 'Unemployment is increasing by the day, businesses are closing at
an alarming rate and confidence is at an all-time low.
'Something must be done. There is an urgent need to start rebuilding our
manufacturing base while there is still time.'
In recent months the EEF has been increasingly critical of government
policies and, under Mr Neil Johnson, its new director-general, has been
beefing up its public profile.
Earlier this month, along with other industrial associations, the EEF
welcomed the chancellor's Autumn Statement as 'a great improvement' on the
government's previous industrial policies. But Mr Johnson said then that
rebuilding the UK industrial base was a job that demanded much longer-term
policies.
