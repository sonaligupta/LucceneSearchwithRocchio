FT  06 JUN 92 / Mellor rejects call over arts export ban


   By ALISON SMITH


THE CREATION of a list of certain art treasures that could not be exported
was rejected yesterday by Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary,
Alison Smith writes.
The idea of the list, containing probably about 2,000 items, was proposed by
the committee that advises on the export of works of art.
Mr Mellor said listing 'would represent a diminution in the rights of owners
to dispose of their property as they saw fit' while banning the export of
outstanding heritage items 'would distort the market value, both for
outstanding items and others'.
He said he shared the view of almost all those who had commented that the
disadvantages of a list outweighed the benefits. He believed there were
other ways of protecting heritage, such as the acceptance of works of art in
lieu of tax.
