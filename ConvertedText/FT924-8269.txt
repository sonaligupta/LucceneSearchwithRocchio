FT  12 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool


Prices are managing to hold fairly steady in most, but there is no sign that
demand is picking up. Recession remains the main factor in most consuming
countries. Only China seems economically sound enough to buy wool in
Australian and New Zealand markets with confidence. The market indicator in
Australia is hovering within a cent or two of the 500 mark, just about at
its lowest this season. There was however a strong sale of Scottish wool in
Bradford yesterday with a full clearance at higher prices.
