FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Well able to adjust


   From Mr P J ROBINSON


Sir, In 'A bureaucratic legacy' (November 5), the authors assert that the
growth in building society staff numbers between 1989 and the present day is
a result of those societies' inability to adjust their management structures
and bureaucratic practices, better to reflect the current business
environment.
This view is two-dimensional at best. It takes no account of diversification
into related financial activities or growth, both organic and by merger.
For my own society, the four years between 1989 and 1992 have seen
substantial changes. No fewer than seven subsidiary companies, spanning life
assurance to unit trusts and French mortgages to savings in the Channel
Islands, have been established. In addition, the society has undertaken an
important merger and has seen assets increase by 54 per cent.
Taken overall, rationalisation following the merger has resulted in a
reduction of staff numbers in real terms, illustrated by a 46 per cent
increase in assets per head.
