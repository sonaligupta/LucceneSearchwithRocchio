FT  04 AUG 92 / UK Company News: New chairman for Reflex


Reflex Investments, the Dublin-quoted computer company, swung from profits
of IPounds 2.51m to losses of IPounds 2.44m (Pounds 2.29m) pre-tax for the
year to April 30.
The result, struck after an exceptional provision of IPounds 1.93m against
stocks, was returned on the back of a IPounds 3.7m reduction in turnover to
IPounds 13.5m.
Mr Tony Kilduff, a 5.2 per cent shareholder in the company, is to increase
his interest in Reflex to 29.99 per cent and become chairman after the
annual meeting in September.
He will purchase 780,340 new ordinary shares from the company at I13.5p to
raise his holding to 9.6 per cent of the enlarged capital and will then make
a tender offer to all shareholders to purchase up to 3.44m shares to bring
his holding up to the 29.99 per cent level.
Mr James Flavin, the current chairman, will step down from the board
following Mr Kilduff's appointment.
