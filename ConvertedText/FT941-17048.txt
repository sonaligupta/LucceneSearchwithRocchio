FT  06 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Kwik Save sells non-core side for Pounds
9.5m


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Kwik Save, the discount food retailer, is selling its Tates convenience
store subsidiary for Pounds 9.5m to AF Blakemore, the family-owned
wholesaler which is a main supplier to the Spar group.
The sale enables Kwik Save to dispose of a non-core business, and is a
significant boost for Blakemore's ambitions in the convenience store market.
Blakemore is paying Pounds 3.5m for the business, plus about Pounds 6m to
settle inter-company loans from Kwik Save to Tates.
Kwik Save acquired Tates, which operates 71 Lateshopper convenience stores
in Humberside, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and the east Midlands, from Northern
Foods in 1986.
Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said it was decided to sell the business
after a strategic review last year.
'We had to decide whether we wanted to feature in a major way in the
convenience store market. If we did, we realised we would have to invest
more.'
Before the sale, Kwik Save bought the freehold of 35 Tates stores for Pounds
7.6m and granted Tates 25-year leases on the properties.
Rental income from the properties will total Pounds 700,000 a year.
Mr Pretty said the net financial effect of the disposal on Kwik Save would
be minimal.
Tates made pre-tax profits in its last financial year of Pounds 1.4m on
sales of Pounds 57.8m.
Blakemore, based in the West Midlands, operates eight cash-and-carry
outlets, as well as supplying 640 Spar and VG stores across central England
and Wales.
These so-called 'symbol' groups comprise independent retailers, who trade
under the same fascia and buy from the same source to reap the benefits of
centralised buying and distribution, advertising and marketing.
Blakemore itself also owns and operates 36 Spar stores.
