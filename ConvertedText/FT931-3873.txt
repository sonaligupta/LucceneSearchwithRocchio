FT  13 MAR 93 / Letter: Not so crazy about it either


   From Mr PETER J TIMMONS


Sir, My sincere thanks to Malcolm Rutherford, who has restored my faith in
drama critics. He alone was not caught by the hype surrounding the opening
of Crazy for You, and gave the only honest review I have read of this
lamentable show which, for some strange reason, seems to be receiving
considerable backing from Radio 2. Is this really the purpose of Britain's
national radio station?
