FT  12 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Further change to asylum bill


A FURTHER move toward providing independent reviews of decisions made on
asylum cases was made by the government yesterday in order to facilitate the
passage of the asylum bill through parliament.
Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, accepted a move to appoint an
independent 'auditor' to monitor the working of the new arrangements. The
bill now awaits a final discussion by MPs of the changes made by peers.
