FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): What they show
 -Equities / The UK Indices


FT Ordinary (30-Share) Index:
Based on 30 blue-chip shares, it is the oldest of the well-known indices and
still a sensitive guide to the day-to-day movements of the stock market.
FT-SE 100 Index:
A capitalisation-weighted index based on the top 100 London-listed stocks,
the 'Footsie 100' is a widely quoted measure of short-term movements.
However, it does not include smaller companies' shares. It is available
minute-by-minute from 8.30 to 4.30, and can be found in your home on BBC and
Channel 4 teletext.
FT-SE Mid 250 Index:
Like the Footsie 100, but covers the next 250 companies ranked by market
value. It is designed to reflect the performance of shares in the middle of
the market. It is calculated minute-by-minute, but may only be found on
professional information services such as the Stock Exchange's Topic.
FT-SE Actuaries 350 Index:
Includes all 350 constituents of the 100 and 250 indices. It is continuously
calculated, and is divided into industry baskets. Covering 92 per cent of
market value, rather than the 72 per cent represented by the Footsie 100, it
gives a better guide to the performance of the market as a whole.
FT-Actuaries All-Share Index:
Published daily since 1962, and well established as the professional
investor's benchmark for medium-term and long-term portfolio performance.
This index has this year been extended to cover about 800, rather than 650,
stocks. It now covers about 98 per cent of the UK market, in terms of value.
It is calculated each evening after the market close, and has many groups
and sub-sections.
FT-SE SmallCap Index:
An innovation for 1993, the SmallCap Index's constituents consist of all
those companies within the All-Share but not large enough to be within the
350. Like the All-Share it is worked out once a day. It is a benchmark for
smaller company funds, including certain unit trusts and investment trusts,
and is liable to show significantly different movements from the indices of
market leaders.
