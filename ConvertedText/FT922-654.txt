FT  26 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Citibank censured after
cancelled bonds appear


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


US REGULATORS yesterday censured Citibank and ordered it to improve controls
on the handling and destruction of cancelled bond certificates after some
certificates the US banking group thought it had destroyed six years ago
turned up recently.
Although most of the cancelled bonds were never exchanged for money, Wall
Street broking house Smith Barney was deceived last November into paying out
Dollars 6.2m on a transaction involving the certificates and a Liechtenstein
bank.
Smith Barney has since filed a lawsuit against Citibank, and against the
Liechtenstein bank, a financial clearing house and Dow Chemical, whose
cancelled bonds it said it unknowingly bought.
Citibank says the suit is without merit. It claims that the certificates
presented to Smith Barney had been perforated to declare them invalid, and
were therefore clearly cancelled.
The controversy over the certificates dates back to 1986, when Citibank used
an outside company to dispose of an unusually large volume of cancelled
certificates that had been in storage.
Although Citibank was assured at the time that all of the certificates had
been destroyed, some found their way to Europe, where last year they were
fraudulently presented for transfer or offered as possible collateral for
loans.
Citibank said that since 1987 its own personnel had destroyed cancelled
certificates on bank premises. Citibank also said yesterday that it believed
it had no 'material financial exposure' to any of the certificates.
