FT  27 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs bid seen


   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


Suggestions in the UK press over the weekend that Zeneca, the drugs group
demerged from ICI last year, may be preparing a Pounds 900m-plus bid for
Boots' pharmaceuticals division triggered a strong performance by the
latter's shares but left those of Zeneca floundering.
Some of the market's drugs analysts were unimpressed with the story; 'A
Glaxo move to acquire Boots' drugs division would make much more sense,'
said one.
Boots' intention to hive off its drugs business has been discussed in the
market for many months but Zeneca had not, until this week, been viewed as a
potential bidder.
Zeneca itself has been considered by the market as a potential target for an
overseas bidder and there has been talk around the City's trading desks of a
merger between Zeneca and Wellcome.
Zeneca shares dropped 25 to 797p on turnover of 2.9m, while Boots was one of
only a handful of FT-SE 100 stocks to make progress on the day, finishing 4
1/2 higher at 530 1/2 p, after touching 536p.
