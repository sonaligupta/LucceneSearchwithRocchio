FT  20 APR 94 / Equitable Life backs watchdog


   By ALISON SMITH


The Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private
investors, received a boost yesterday with the announcement that Equitable
Life has applied to join it.
But Mr Roy Ranson, Equitable's managing director, made it clear that the
life insurer still had reservations about the new regulator.
At a time when some life companies, banks and others - including Allied
Dunbar and Lloyds Bank - have not yet decided whether to apply to join the
PIA, the expression of support from a company seen as having a good record
on compliance will be valuable to the authority.
The PIA has suffered from uncertainty about whether it will attract enough
industry support to win credibility, and has also come under fire from a
cross-party committee of MPs looking at financial regulation. The Commons
Treasury committee continues its inquiry today with evidence from TSB, which
has already applied to the PIA, and from Halifax building society, another
important potential dissident.
The PIA has received about 2,350 applications so far, out of a total
potential membership of about 6,000.
Mr Ranson said that whatever the long-term direction of regulation might be,
Equitable Life believed the PIA was 'the next practical step', and that it
would build on the work done by Lautro, the existing regulator for the life
insurance industry.
However, he criticised the PIA's planned fee structure, in which
subscriptions will be based on amounts of new business. He called for a new
approach in which the amounts paid were related to the amount of regulatory
effort a company required.
This could mean, for example, a structure in which the size of sales force
and the company's record on compliance might be factors in setting fees.
