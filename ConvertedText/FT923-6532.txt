FT  24 AUG 92 / Courtship in the land of the giants: A look at the prospects
for a GMB/TGWU merger


   By MICHAEL SMITH


MR John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general workers' union, is not
the shy, retiring type. He is quick to express his views and rarely allows
himself to be overshadowed by other union leaders.
Imagine, then, the surprise of the union's 863,000 members to see the
prominence given to Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary of the TGWU
general union, in the first four issues of Direct, the GMB's glossy new
monthly magazine.
Each issue has carried at least one picture of the TGWU leader and one
printed four images of him to accompany an interview in which his views on a
wide range of issues were given a generous airing.
The explanation can be found in the courtship which has emerged this year
between the GMB and TGWU. The GMB has used promotion of Mr Morris's views to
gauge its members' views of him, of the TGWU and, most important, of a
possible merger.
The word from the union's headquarters in Wimbledon, south-west London, is
that the reaction to Mr Morris has been favourable.
That is just as well. It now seems almost certain that merger talks will
begin later this year. That does not make amalgamation a certainty, but for
the first time it seems a strong possibility.
If industrial logic was the only criteria amalgamation would have taken
place years ago.
As general unions, the GMB and TGWU organise in similar and, in many cases,
the same industries. They both have substantial memberships in local
government, and non-engineering areas of manufacturing such as plastics,
chemicals, glass, and food. Together they claim about 95 per cent of the
unionised part of the clothing and textiles industry.
In many companies officials of both unions attend the same meetings with
employers, represent the same kind of workers, often unskilled, and argue
the same points. Merger supporters point out that thousands of working
hours, paid for by the unions, could be saved by sending one official to the
meetings rather than two.
There is scope for rationalisation of office space. Both unions have offices
in virtually all large towns and declining membership means that some are
already underused.
There are, however, powerful cultural and political differences between the
unions which will make amalgamation discussions difficult, and may
eventually scupper them.
In the TGWU shop stewards wield considerable influence and the executive,
which is made up of lay members, is left of centre. At the GMB the
officials, negotiators and regional officials are more dominant and power is
concentrated in fewer hands. Mr Edmonds tends to get his way far more than
recent TGWU general secretaries have at their union.
His politics and those of the union are right of centre in the Labour party.
The TGWU has embarrassed party leaders several times in recent years, over
issues including nuclear disarmament, while the GMB has been a model of
loyalty.
The political and cultural differences, with fierce competition to recruit
members from similar groups of workers, meant that until just a year ago the
possibility of a merger had never been seriously raised. Two developments
have changed the climate.
First, all unions have experienced financial difficulties as the membership
rolls have declined, few more so than the TGWU which last year spent Pounds
11m more than its income.
Backed by hefty assets, the TGWU's future is not in danger, especially as
monthly operating deficits have been significantly lowered and possibly
eliminated.
But the financial difficulties have concentrated minds as to whether
resources would be improved if a powerful merger partner could be found.
The second development has been the merger of the AEU engineers and EETPU
electricians to form the AEEU, and the likely amalgamation of Nalgo, Nupe
and Cohse public-sector unions.
For more than 60 years the 1.1m-strong TGWU has prided itself on being
Britain's largest union and in recent years the GMB has been chasing it
hard. Next year both will be overtaken by Unison, the Nalgo, Nupe and Cohse
amalgamation, which will have 1.5m members.
'Where do we general unions go?' says one GMB official. 'The danger is that
the we will be squeezed hard when we try to recruit members, both in
manufacturing, by the AEEU, and in the public services by Unison.'
As recruitment becomes increasingly difficult, the TGWU and GMB's best hopes
of growth are through mergers. Other unions that may seek partners in the
next few years include the Usdaw shop workers, the Ucatt construction
workers and perhaps even the MSF general technical union.
