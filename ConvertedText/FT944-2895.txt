FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: HK watchdog seeks liquidation of
MKI


   By SIMON HOLBERTON


   HONG KONG


Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), the colony's corporate
watchdog, has applied to the Hong Kong Supreme Court to have MKI
Corporation, an investment company, wound up.
The petition - the first of its kind by the SFC - follows an investigation
of the company's affairs under a section of the SFC's enabling legislation
where it suspects a company or its officers may be involved in fraudulent
activity, misfeasance or other misconduct.
MKI's shares were suspended in June after the SFC questioned it about its
recent share price performance and a number of statements it had made
concerning future prospects. These included a mobile telephone deal in China
and a plan to site a super-computer in Inner Mongolia to analyse seismic
data in Asia.
The decision came days after Mr Yao Mingwei was appointed chairman. Mr Yao
is the son of the late Mr Yao Yilin, a former Chinese vice-premier. He
replaced Mr Khundkar Khalid Ahmed Hossein who had himself only replaced Mr
David Tang, a company director, as chairman in September.
MKI's founder and main shareholder is Mr Arthur Lai, an entrepreneur, who
sold his stockbroking business to Standard Chartered in the wake of the 1987
stock market crash.
The SFC said that its application to have MKI wound up was based on its
belief 'that the affairs of MKI have been conducted in a manner unfairly
prejudicial to its shareholders'.
The High Court will hear the application on January 11.
