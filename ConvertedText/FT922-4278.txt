FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wintrust declines to Pounds 3.02m


Wintrust, the merchant banker, saw pre-tax profits for the year to March 31
fall from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 3.02m. However, the company said that the
second six months showed profits 10 per cent higher than the comparable
period and the return on assets had increased from 2.7 per cent to 3.7 per
cent.
Mr Richard Szpiro, managing director, said the results must be regarded with
satisfaction as they covered a period in which the problems of financial
companies worsened.
Earnings per share were 19.54p (27.37p) basic or 19.16p (25.66p) fully
diluted. An unchanged final dividend of 6.3p is proposed for a maintained
9.3p.
