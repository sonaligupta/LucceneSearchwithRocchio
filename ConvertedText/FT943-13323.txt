FT  20 JUL 94 / Observer: Name-calling


Hi-Tec, the sports and leisure-wear company 54 per cent-owned by founder
Frank van Wenzel, is selling 60 per cent of a subsidiary, Cofex, to a Dutch
company, Vile Holdings. Some clever nominal synergy at work here - Cofex
sells sports and leisurewear under the brand name 'Bad Boys'.
