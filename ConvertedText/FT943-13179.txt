FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Eve static following interest income
setback


   By TIM BURT


Eve Group, the USM-quoted civil engineering group, blamed sluggish trading
conditions in the construction industry for a flat performance in the year
to March 31.
Pre-tax profits fell slightly from Pounds 4.15m to Pounds 3.9m despite a 16
per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 61.6m (Pounds 53m).
Mr Peter Adams, finance director, said the decline was exacerbated by a
sharp fall in interest earned on the group's deposit funds, which fell from
Pounds 487,000 to Pounds 181,000.
Although operating profits were virtually unchanged at Pounds 3.68m (Pounds
3.66m), he claimed it was 'a creditable performance given the battering the
industry has taken during the recession'.
The shares, however, fell 25p to 383p.
Gross margins declined from 8.6 per cent to 7.5 per cent and profits in
contracting - the largest of the company's three business sectors - fell
from Pounds 3.95m to Pounds 3.65m.
Mr Graham Foster, managing director, hinted that the results would have been
worse had it not been for increased orders in the transmission division,
which designs and manufactures overhead power line systems and communication
towers. It had won a number of contracts for the National Grid network and
had opportunities to win orders in France and Italy, he added.
Mr Foster also hailed an improved contribution from Trakway, the portable
road and walkway division, which increased profits from Pounds 1.21m to
Pounds 1.34m.
Losses in the property development division, meanwhile, were cut from Pounds
576,000 to Pounds 390,000 although the company warned that activity remained
subdued.
Earnings per share fell from 27.4p to 25.4p.
While expressing disappointment at the pace of recovery in the construction
industry, Mr Foster said the company was confident enough about future
prospects to recommend an increased final dividend of 8p, making a total of
11p (10p) for the year.
