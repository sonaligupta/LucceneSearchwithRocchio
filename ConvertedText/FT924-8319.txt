FT  11 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips encounter another
late sell-off


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Wall Street
FOR THE second consecutive day, blue chip stocks ran into a late sell-off
yesterday as the broader market more than held its ground, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 15.40 at 3,225.47, with
the bulk of the loss incurred in the final 30 minutes of trading. Secondary
indices fared better. The more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 ended
0.03 up at 418.62 and the Nasdaq composite continued to outperform, rising
5.71 to 627.76 amid further strong demand for technology stocks.
New York SE turnover was heavy at 223m shares, and rises outpaced declines
by 986 to 817.
The day's economic news appeared positive for both equities and bonds. The
index of producer prices (PPI) rose 0.1 per cent in October (it actually
fell 0.1 per cent when the traditionally volatile food and energy components
were excluded). The market had been expecting a rise in the PPI of about 0.3
per cent, and the figures sparked a rally in bond prices, lowering long-term
market interest rates in the process.
The positive inflation news, however, failed to boost senti ment on stock
markets. Analysts said that with the Presidential election out of the way,
investors were looking to economic and corporate earnings fundamentals and
the PPI figures were not good enough on their own to spark a rally.
Airlines, which have posted strong gains recently on the back of falling oil
prices, came under selling pressure on reports that Saudi Arabia supports
limiting the crude output of Opec member countries. AMR, parent of American
Airlines, relinquished Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 65.
Revco slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8 after the company, as part of a
major refinancing, filed for a rights offering and an issue of new senior
notes due in 1999.
Wal-Mart eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 62 3/8 , although it revealed
third-quarter profits of Dollars 438m, up sharply from the Dollars 353m
earned a year ago. Other retailers reporting yesterday included JC Penney,
down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 75 1/2 after a near 60 per cent improvement in
profits, and The Limited, Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 23 3/8 after net
income only slightly higher than a year earlier.
Canada
THE PRICE of gold bullion and gold shares sank further, leaving the Toronto
market with its sixth consecutive loss. The TSE 300 index fell 16.6 to
3,277.2 and declines led rises by 322 to 242 after a large volume of 40.6m
shares. The golds sector index dropped 3.74 per cent as spot gold in New
York lost USDollars 2.80 to USDollars 330.25, another six-year low.
The market was also focused on a possible rise in the Bank of Canada's key
rate, which is expected to climb as much as 90 basis points at tomorrow's
weekly setting of the rate.
