FT  20 APR 91 / Way clear for Hungarian property compensation bill


   By NICHOLAS DENTON


   BUDAPEST


A BILL to give limited compensation for property expropriated by the
Communist regime in Hungary has overcome a crucial legal hurdle, clearing
away damaging uncertainty over Hungary's privatisation programme.
The constitutional court rejected an application to annul the government's
proposals, clearing the way for the bill to be passed by parliament next
week.
The court's decision carries the promise of a conclusion to a long and
bitter debate over conflicting priorities: justice for former owners or the
encouragement of new and foreign investment.
'The general approach will be that the state will sell state property, and
not give it back to original holders,' said Mr Karoly Szabo, deputy director
of the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority. Reparation would
be partial and financial, costing an estimated Ft100bn (Pounds 750m) he said
yesterday.
Redress for farming families, though, is much more generous, reflecting the
conservative government's dependence on the Smallholders' party for its
parliamentary majority.
