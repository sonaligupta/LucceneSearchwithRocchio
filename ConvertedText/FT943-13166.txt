FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Westland share sale helps United
Tech


   By MARTIN DICKSON


United Technologies, the diversified US technology group, yesterday reported
a 32 per cent increase in net income for the second quarter, helped by
higher operating profits at most of its divisions and an Dollars 87m pre-tax
gain from the sale of its interest in Westland, the UK aerospace business.
UTC made profits of Dollars 172m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, compared with
Dollars 130m, or 89 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues
totalled Dollars 5.49bn, compared with Dollars 5.57bn.
The company took a pre-tax charge of Dollars 50m at its Pratt & Whitney
aero-engine unit and one of Dollars 35m at its Hamilton Standard aerospace
business.
Pratt reported operating income of Dollars 103m before the charge compared
with Dollars 22m in the same period of last year. Revenues dipped to Dollars
1.48bn from Dollars 1.77bn.
The improved profits were attributed to higher commercial spare parts sales,
reduced research and development spending, and the sale of participation
interests in its PW4000 engine programme.
The flight systems segment, which includes the Sikorsky helicopter unit, had
operating income of Dollars 47m, down from Dollars 80m last year.
For the six months, UTC made Dollars 278m, or Dollars 1.98 a share, compared
with Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.38, in 1993.
