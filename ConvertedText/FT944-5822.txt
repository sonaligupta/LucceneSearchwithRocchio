FT  01 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By JEFFREY BROWN


Stock index futures extended their recent rally to five days, the FT-SE 100
December contract moving back near to 3,100 in improving trading volume,
writes Jeffrey Brown.
December stood at 3,093 at the close of pit trading for a rise of 25 points.
Over the past five sessions the contract has advanced 69 points.
At the official close the premium to the cash market was 13 points - more
than seven points over fair value - but at times during the day the premium
topped 20 points, encouraging a certain amount of arbitrage business.
Although volume remained below the level at which most traders are happy to
run a book, there was a notable increase to 12,828 lots, from under 10,000
on Tuesday. Most real business was on the buying side and dealers said
sentiment showed a clear improvement.
There was some buying for next year, which helped to underpin the better
mood, with around 1,400 of the day's trades counting as roll-over into the
March contract.
Option trading remained subdued, with 27,102 contracts dealt, against 25,991
on Tuesday. Call and put trading was again fairly evenly matched. FT-SE and
Euro FT-SE turnover accounted for almost 17,000 lots. British Gas was the
most active stock option at 1,145 lots dealt. Banks were busy, notably
Barclays and HSBC.
