FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas rises


   By MARTIN DICKSON


MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, the financially-stretched US defence and aerospace group,
underscored its improving health by reporting a sharp increase in
fourth-quarter earnings and a further reduction in its debt burden, writes
Martin Dickson.
The St Louis-based company, which is being hit by the downturn in US defence
spending, reported net earnings of Dollars 211m, or Dollars 5.50 a share,
compared with break-even in the fourth quarter of last year, when the
company took a Dollars 219m after-tax provision for the cancelled A-12
aircraft programme.
Revenues totalled Dollars 1.5bn, against Dollars 1.12bn. For the full year,
the group earned Dollars 423m, or Dollars 11.03 a share, compared with
Dollars 306m, or Dollars 7.99 in 1990.
The company's debt - apart from at its financial services unit - fell to
Dollars 2.39bn at the year-end, against Dollars 2.68bn three months before.
The level of debt has dropped 28 per cent since its peak last March, when
analysts questioned if the company might have to file for bankruptcy. The
company still needs capital to develop aircraft, and Taiwan Aerospace is
considering buying a 40 per cent stake in its civil aircraft operations for
Dollars 2bn.
Behind the improving balance sheet and profit figures is a much better
performance at its civil aircraft business, which began deliveries of its
new wide-bodied jet, the MD-11, just before the start of 1991.
