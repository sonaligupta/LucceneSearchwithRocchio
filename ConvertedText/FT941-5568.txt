FT  05 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Sector led by Glaxo


   By JOEL KIBAZO, STEVE THOMPSON and CLARE GASCOIGNE


The pharmaceuticals sector was led by Glaxo, which also took the accolade as
the FT-SE 100's best individual performer and the market's heaviest traded
stock as the shares raced higher on news that the German authorities are to
ban the use of the intravenous-type anti-ulcer drug Losec, manufactured by
Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals company. It was emphasised by analysts,
however, that the intravenous form of Losec is only a small part of overall
sales of Losec. The German ban on the intravenous form of Losec came amid
concerns about possible damage to patients hearing and sight.
Losec has long been viewed as the biggest market threat to Glaxo's
anti-ulcer drug, Zantac. The Losec news came during an afternoon global
conference call organised by Astra.
Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals specialist at UBS, the securities house,
said the latest developments regarding Losec would be seen as good news only
in the near-term until the Losec details are clarified. He did emphasise
however, Glaxo's 'exceptionally attractive' yield. Mr Peter Cartwright,
pharmaceuticals specialist and head of research at Williams de Broe, the
stockbroker, described Glaxo as 'the most attractive stock in the UK
pharmaceuticals sector.'
Glaxo shares raced up to 712p, before closing a net 25, or 3.7 per cent,
higher at 707p. Turnover of 13m was the highest single day's activity in the
stock since the group revealed sharply better than expected interim figures
on February 17. SmithKline Beecham put on 5 to 396p.
