FT  19 APR 94 / UK Company News: Usborne shares suspended


Shares in Usborne were suspended yesterday at 19 1/2 p after the group
warned of substantial interim losses following problems on the pig
production side.
Dealings have been halted until publication of the interim results, expected
next month after completion of an investigation and review of the pig
operations.
Usborne said arrangements to date, including a long term supply contract
with Unigate, had not been sufficient to insulate pig production activities
from the impact of the weak market.
The conditions, combined with a deterioration in productivity, had
contributed to substantial trading losses on pig activities.
The difficulties had been further compounded by a breakdown in management
control of the pig operations, including accounting systems, as a result of
which the extent of the decline was not immediately recognised.
The group's main grain trading activities had been unaffected by the
problems, although first-half profits were lower than last time.
