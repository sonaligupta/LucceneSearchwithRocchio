FT  12 APR 94 / Ark Royal 'under fire'


   By KERIN HOPE


   ATHENS


A left-wing Greek terrorist organisation yesterday claimed it had fired a
rocket at the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal while it was docked in
Piraeus harbour for maintenance work. In a call to a radio station, the
group also claimed responsibility for attacks on Sunday night on two foreign
insurance companies in Athens. A search of the vessel revealed no evidence
to back the terrorist group's claim. However, Greek police later found two
3.5in rockets and two plastic pipes, apparently intended as launchers, in a
timber warehouse near where the ship was docked.
