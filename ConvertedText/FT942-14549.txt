FT  20 APR 94 / Minister assures veterans on D-day


   By PHILIP STEPHENS


The government yesterday sought to defuse the row over the 50th anniversary
of the D-day landings by assuring veterans' organisations that the planned
celebrations would not undermine the solemnity of the event, Philip Stephens
writes.
Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, told leaders of the Royal British
Legion and the Normandy Veteran's Association that the government would not
trivialise the commemoration of the allies' invasion in June 1944.
His meeting with the veterans followed complaints from former participants
in the Normandy landings that the government's support for street parties
and other celebrations were an inappropriate way to mark an event which saw
the deaths of 37,000 allied soldiers.
It was followed by a firm defence by Mr John Major in the Commons of the
government's commemoration plans. The prime minister insisted that the
veterans had been consulted.
However, after their talks with Mr Brooke the veterans' representatives
insisted that they remained unhappy with the plans. They said they would be
sending a list of recommendations to the government calling for a national
day of mourning on June 6 - the anniversary of the landings - and the
cancellation of a planned extravaganza in London's Hyde Park.
