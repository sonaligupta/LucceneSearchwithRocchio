FT  12 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Wm Cook hit by US losses


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday reported a
collapse in profits following the slide into losses of a US company acquired
two years ago.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to October 3 fell from Pounds 4.05m to
Pounds 604,000 on sales down 13 per cent at Pounds 49.6m.
In spite of the recession, the company said its UK operations held up well
with margins almost maintained at 8.2 per cent.
The problem was with Unitcast, the US steel-caster purchased in 1990. During
the period, it lost Pounds 1.1m on turnover of Pounds 3.47m after sales to
the US rail freight cars business collapsed.
Monthly losses at the US company have been reduced to Pounds 100,000 a
month. If a buyer is not found by the end of the year, the company will be
closed, according to Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive.
Sales in the US fell 40 per cent and while eight William Cook executives had
been despatched to sort out the problem, Mr Cook said the company had been
caught in 'an old fashioned knacker-trap.'
In the UK, however, sales of Pounds 46.2m produced profits of Pounds 3.77m.
Gearing fell slightly during the period to 65 per cent. However, an expected
write-off of the Unitcast investment is likely to increase the percentage.
Earnings per share dropped from 12.96p to 1.93p and the interim dividend is
cut from 5p to 1.5p.
COMMENT
There are occasions when shareholders would be best served by the chief
executive leaving for a two year holiday; sometimes, there can be no more
powerful sell signal than a management team with time on its hands. William
Cook is a case in point. Within two years it has paid Dollars 12.6m for an
ill-considered expansion into the US and has tried and failed to take over
Telfos, the engineering group. The latter left William Cook with a bruised
reputation and a Pounds 300,000 loss; the US move is more likely to leave
the group with a Pounds 6m write-off. Whether exceptional or extraordinary,
this is a nasty dent in the balance sheet. The shame is that underneath is a
good business. The same man who sunk William Cook in its US adventure
successfully forged the UK foundry industry into a workable and
internationally competitive form. With forecasts of Pounds 3.7m pre-tax this
year, giving 12p of earnings and a prospective multiple of 8, this stock is
undervalued.
