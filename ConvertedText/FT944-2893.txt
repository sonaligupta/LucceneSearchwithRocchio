FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: Israeli electronics maker
postpones equity issue

   LONDON


Tadiran, the Israeli electronics company, has postponed an international
equity issue due to 'market conditions in both the Israeli and international
markets', writes Richard Lapper in London. The company, one of a number of
Israeli businesses seeking capital on international markets, had been
planning to raise up to Dollars 80m in an issue lead managed by Merrill
Lynch.
The price of the company's shares, which trade only in New York, is
currently at Dollars 18.50, having fallen Dollars 3.50 since the issue was
announced earlier this year.
Tadiran also said a special interim dividend, which depended on the global
offering being done, will not be paid. 'Plans for a future offering will be
announced as events warrant,' the company said. It also said it would report
by January 3 whether its shares would be listed in Tel Aviv.
