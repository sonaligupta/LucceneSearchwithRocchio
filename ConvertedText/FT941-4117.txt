FT  12 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift Barclays


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


Increasing optimism about Barclays Bank's dividend paying capacity prompted
another powerful performance by the bank's shares which extended Thursday's
late rally. News that Goldman Sachs, the influential US investment bank, had
added Barclays shares to its list of best buys helped to boost the stock.
Mr Rod Barrett, Goldman's UK banks specialist, said both Barclays and
Natwest were cheap stocks in the sector. He said the appointment of Mr
Martin Taylor as Barclays' new chief executive was an 'influence for the
positive' and he expected the bank to build from a base of lower provisions.
The Goldman recommendation was preceded by sustained and heavy buying of
Barclays. Other big broking houses, such as Lehman Brothers, were also said
to have been recommending the shares.
However, news that Standard & Poor's, the US debt-rating agency had placed
its double 'A' senior debt ratings for Barclays on creditwatch took the
shares down from the day's high of 536p. They closed 9 up at 519p on
turnover of 24m. S & P said Barclays' underlying profitability was
satisfactory but provisions were high and there appeared to be further
deterioration of asset quality in Europe and the US.
NatWest responded to Goldman's positive stance, ending the session
marginally higher at 467p.
