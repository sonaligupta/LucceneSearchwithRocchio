FT  01 JUL 92 / ICI and Calgene see red over longer-lasting tomatoes


   By PAUL ABRAHAMS


IMPERIAL Chemical Industries and Calgene, a Californian company, are trying
to squash each other's tomato patents.
The tomato war broke out yesterday when each claimed the other had infringed
its patents for genetically improved longer-lasting, non-squidgy tomatoes.
At stake is a significant part of the world's Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn)
fresh tomato market.
Both companies have developed tomatoes which retain their flavour and
firmness longer. Each pinpointed an enzyme that makes tomatoes rot and then
blocked its action. Unfortunately, they both picked the same enzyme.
Yesterday the US Patent and Trademark Office said their patents were similar
and would investigate which was valid.
Once decided, the winner could make significant profits from the US
processed tomato paste market worth about Dollars 4.2bn a year. In 1995, ICI
plans to introduce into the processed tomato market an improved fruit which
makes naturally thick paste for use in ketchups and sauces.
But the companies are not intent on driving each other out of the market. Mr
Simon Best, business manager of the fruit and vegetable activities at ICI
Seeds, says the company is prepared to negotiate a compromise with Calgene.
'Although we have no immediate plans to contact Calgene, the lines are
open,' he says.
However, the companies may need to be thick skinned. If a compromise is not
achieved, the Patent and Trademark Office would adjudicate, starting its
hearings in September.
Meanwhile, the race is on to use the technology to stop peaches, plums,
apples, apricots, pears, papayas, bananas and avocado pears rotting, says Mr
Best.
