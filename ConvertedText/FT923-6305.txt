FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Honeywell settles suit with
Nikon


   By AP-DJ


   TOKYO


NIKON will pay Honeywell, the US controls group, Dollars 45m to settle a
lawsuit involving the Japanese camera maker's use of patented auto-focus
technology, according to a report filed with Japan's Ministry of Finance,
AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
The Nikon-Honeywell agreement covers the Japanese camera maker's use of the
patented technology in cameras from March 1986 through to March this year.
For the ensuing period, Nikon will pay an undisclosed amount in royalties
until the respective expirations of the patents.
Honeywell brought the suit on March 3 against Nikon and several other
photographic equipment manufacturers.
Japan's Canon, in a related but separate move, reported last week that it
had reached agreement with Honeywell to settle their legal dispute. The two
companies declined to comment on the details, but the pact is reported to
involve the cross-licensing of products, positioning Canon to make a profit
in the long run.
Mr Shigeo Ono, Nikon's managing director, said the sparsity of overlap
between his company's and Honeywell's business activities precluded such an
arrangement.
