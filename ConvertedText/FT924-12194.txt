FT  22 OCT 92 / Summers calls for economic rethink


   By REUTER


   SINGAPORE


A senior World Bank official yesterday called for richer nations to adopt
active economic policies and ease 1980s-style fear of inflation to revive
growth, Reuter reports from Singapore.
'If we're going to do better in the next decade I don't think there's any
alternative to greater government action,' Mr Lawrence Summers, bank
vice-president and chief economist, said in a speech in Singapore.
Mr Summers said industrial nations should ease adherence to the tight-money,
non-interventionist dogma of the 1980s - including fear of inflation and a
reluctance to fine-tune economies through targeted government spending and
flexible policies.
