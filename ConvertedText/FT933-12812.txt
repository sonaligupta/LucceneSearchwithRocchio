FT  22 JUL 93 / Observer: Not cricket


Mere heart surgery will not be a sufficient excuse for MPs to miss tonight's
Commons vote on Maastricht's social chapter, about which CIB, and others,
are so exercised. Bob Parry, Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, has said he
will travel to London, in spite of recovering from a quadruple by-pass
operation.
On the government side, ailing cabinet ministers Michael Heseltine and John
Patten will of course also rise from their sick beds. Only a Eurosceptic
could stay tucked up under the sheets safe from the whips' attentions.
Meanwhile, the fit in body, of whichever political persuasion, will be aware
of one unappealing consequence of a Conservative trouncing. With an
Anglo-French government summit set for Monday, the confidence motion that
Labour would demand were John Major to lose would almost certainly have to
be debated tomorrow - completely disrupting the planned annual cricket match
between MPs and political journalists.
