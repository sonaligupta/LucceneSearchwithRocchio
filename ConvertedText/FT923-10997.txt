FT  28 JUL 92 / Dentists strike in Germany


   By QUENTIN PEEL

NEARLY 3,000 dentists in Germany's populous North Rhine region downed drills
and closed surgeries yesterday in protest at the government's plans to cut
spending on the state-subsidised health care system.
Members of the Free Association of German Dentists are being urged to pull
out of the public health insurance scheme, and only accept patients
privately, mirroring a move taken by British dentists three weeks ago.
At the same time doctors in the wealthy state of Baden-Wurttemberg are
organising a mass poster campaign attacking the health minister, Mr Horst
Seehofer, who has drawn up plans to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year from
the swelling costs of the health service.
They include a freeze on doctors' and dentists' fees, as well as on
pharmaceutical prices, an increase in hospital fees, and a system to curb
prescriptions by doctors: if they prescribe more than laid down in strict
budgets, their fees will be cut accordingly.
Mr Seehofer denounced the dentists' strike action yesterday as 'absolutely
excessive'.
