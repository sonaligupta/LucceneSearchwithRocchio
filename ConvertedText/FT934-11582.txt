FT  30 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Record high for Warburg


   By STEVE THOMPSON, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY


THE recent upsurge in the merchant banking area of the market, triggered by
expectations of substantial trading profits from booming international bonds
and equity markets plus the probability of increased mergers and acquisition
business, continued apace.
SG Warburg, the more marketable of the two merchant banks in the FT-SE 100
index raced up 11 more to a record 924p, leaving the stock on the brink of
the exclusive Pounds 2bn market capitalisation club. Turnover in the shares,
rarely above 1m a day, totalled 1.5m. The bank is scheduled to announce
interim results on November 9, with analysts looking for something like a
150 per cent increase in profits and a near 15 per cent jump in the interim
dividend. Marketmakers are talking the shares up to Pounds 10-plus in the
short term.
The upsurge on Hong Kong markets had a big impact of the UK banks with
widespread and lucrative interests in the far east. HSBC was the big winner
in the sector, closing 15 higher at 762p -within 13p of the all-time high -
after heavy turnover of 7.8m shares. Standard Chartered, meanwhile, raced up
18 to a peak 1088p.
