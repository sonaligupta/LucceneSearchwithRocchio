FT  11 APR 92 / Letter: Reactions to inflation


   From Mr PETER STEPHENS


Sir, Your leader, 'New challenges for Mr Mieno' (April 1), graphically
describes the effects of over-reaction to the age of inflation. As you say,
'last year's hero risks turning into today's villain'.
Your comments apply all the more to the UK. The terrifying consequences of
clinging to the wholly inappropriate discipline of the ERM in terms of flow
or zero economic growth and scandalous rises in unemployment for years to
come are just not being debated. Why not?
The level of currency is an effect not a cause. Winston Churchill discovered
this in the late 1920s when obliged to drop the Gold Standard.
