FT  29 JUL 92 / Brittan move on ABB 'aid'


   By ANDREW HILL and REUTER


   BRUSSELS


Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, is to recommend that Asea
Brown Boveri (ABB), the engineering company, should repay Pta35.9bn (Pounds
197m) in state aid to the Spanish government, write Andrew Hill and Reuter
in Brussels. Sir Leon will put his proposal to fellow commissioners on
Friday.
A court battle with ABB - which denies it received the aid - and possibly
also with Madrid, is likely to follow any repayment order. The Commission
claims the aid was in the form of forgiveness by Spanish public authorities
of debts owed by an ailing electrical capital goods group, CCC, when ABB
took it over in 1990.
