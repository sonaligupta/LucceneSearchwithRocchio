FT  22 OCT 92 / Group wins feasibility study

JAPAN'S six leading trading houses have reached an agreement to conduct a
feasibility study into the building of a Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex
in the northern Chinese province of Liaoning.
The complex would be one of the largest foreign investment projects in
China. Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house, said yesterday the
Japanese side would provide at least 51 per cent of the Dollars 4bn.
Mitsubishi said the Chinese government had given formal permission for the
feasibility study, likely to begin early next year and take at least a year
to complete.
If all goes to plan, the complex, which will include an oil refinery and a
450,000-tonne-a-year ethylene facility, would be completed by the end of the
decade.
The proposal by the six partners, also including Marubeni Corp, Sumitomo
Corp, Mitsui & Co, Itochu, and Nissho Iwai, is a reflection of the
heightened interest in China as a site for production facilities. Japanese
investment in China rose from Dollars 349m (Pounds 203m) in 1990 to Dollars
579m last year.
Mitsubishi said some of the required oil for the plant is likely to come
from the northern Chinese field of Daqing, and the remainder will be
imported. It is likely the Chinese government will insist that a fixed
percentage of the ethylene output be exported to earn foreign exchange,
while the rest would meet fast-growing demand within China.
The Chinese government recently approved equipment imports for a
300,000-tonne ethylene facility in the southern province of Guangdong.
