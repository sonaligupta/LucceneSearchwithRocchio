FT  21 NOV 92 / Banks fear green policy effects


   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent


BANKS MAY stop lending to companies in industries that are perceived to be
'environmentally risky' unless their liability is limited under British and
European law, the chief executive of National Westminster Bank warned
yesterday.
Mr Derek Wanless said the creditworthiness of enterprises in industries
including natural resources, forestry and chemicals might suffer if their
lenders were held responsible for environmental damage.
Mr Wanless, chairman of the financial sector working group of the
government's advisory committee on business and the environment, said
environmental damage for which a polluter could not pay should be treated as
a 'social cost'.
He argued that European law was in danger of straying from the 'polluter
pays' principle by extending liability for pollution to lenders, and thus
making banks liable to pay amounts 'considerably greater than the loan'.
He told a Brussels conference on business and the environment: 'A small loan
to purchase a small industrial site could result in millions of pounds in
clean-up costs for lenders or investors if the site is or becomes polluted.'
Mr Wanless said there was an increasing number of cases of lenders deciding
not to extend credit because of the risk of being held liable for
environmental damage. 'A large segment of Europe's economy is subject to
some form of visible environmental risk.' That might lead to businesses
being unable to find finance to clean up existing environmental damage.
