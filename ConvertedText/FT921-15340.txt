FT  10 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): LCD heads for the big screen


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


A LIQUID crystal display big enough for the screen of a portable television
set, has been developed by Sharp Corporation in Japan.
The 16.5-inch screen uses thin film transistor technology in which each of
the pixels (picture elements) that make up the screen is controlled by three
transistors - one for each primary colour. The latest Sharp picture has more
than 1.2m pixels and can handle wide-screen television broadcasts.
Sharp says the screen is also the first LCD one which can be used with
personal computers for multimedia applications, combining data, video and
sound.
