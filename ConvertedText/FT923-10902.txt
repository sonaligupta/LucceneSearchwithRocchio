FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Discount rate cut fails
to boost confidence in Japan

   TOKYO, ISLAMABAD


A CUT in the official discount rate failed to boost confidence, and the
Nikkei average fell to another six-year low as afternoon selling erased
morning gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 124.45 to 15,373.34, its lowest since March 1986.
The index registered a high for the day of 15,974.31 in the morning on the
Bank of Japan's half-point cut in the discount rate to 3.25 per cent.
However, buying by dealers petered out as investors remained reluctant to
commit new funds to the market, and the index dropped to the session's low
of 15,288.34 in the afternoon.
Volume was still thin, totalling 220m shares against Friday's 201m. Falls
outpaced rises by 625 to 299, with 189 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks shed 10.61 to 1,193.94, slipping below the year's
low recorded in April, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.94 to
934.46.
Traders said favourable domestic factors - the discount rate cut and the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party's victory in Sunday's upper house elections
 -were already discounted. Last Friday's emergency cabinet meeting convened
by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to discuss support measures for
the stock market and the economy did not produce specific results.
Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, said:
'Investors do not think the support measures for the economy will have a
direct impact on the stock market. What the market needs is something that
works immediately.'
Blue chip electricals declined, Hitachi falling Y13 to Y732. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone lost Y9,000 to Y582,000. Dealers took profits in
speculative theme stocks: Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue,
receded Y28 to Y894.
Daikyo, the condominium developer, plunged Y77 to an all-time low of Y544 on
further rumours of financial troubles.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 207.70 to 17,732.33, its lowest since
November 1986. Volume dropped to 6.5m shares from Friday's heavy 24m.
Roundup
THE Japanese discount rate reduction also failed to cheer other Pacific Rim
markets yesterday.
BANGKOK was pulled lower by the debut of Thai Airways International shares,
the largest issue ever offered on the exchange. The SET index lost 11.22, or
1.5 per cent, to 734.94 in a turnover of Bt4.83bn. Thai Airways fell Bt5.50
from the opening level to end at Bt55.50, almost losing a day's limit of 10
per cent.
BOMBAY rose sharply after a court ruled in favour of a BSE petition to free
shares seized by the government in connection with a financial scandal.
Brokers ended their trading boycott and the BSE index leapt 125.81, or 4.7
per cent, to 2,804.15.
KARACHI continued to slide as investors were discouraged by political
uncertainty, caused by a split between the ruling coalition and one of its
allies in Karachi, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad.
The KSE-100 index broke through the 1,400 support level to close at
1,384.94, down 16.41 or 1.2 per cent.
HONG KONG reversed early gains, the Hang Seng index ending a net 108.37, or
1.9 per cent, off at 5,664.3 in turnover of HKDollars 3.44bn. Active issues
included HSBC Holdings, down 50 cents at HKDollars 51.50, and Cheung Kong,
30 cents cheaper at HKDollars 24.00.
SINGAPORE saw profit-taking after climbing sharply in early trading. The
Straits Times Industrial index was finally 21.03 up at 1,422.34. SIA rose
SDollars 1 to SDollars 13.70 on news of a proposed one-for-one scrip issue,
but the foreign shares were unchanged at SDollars 17.20. Inchcape gained 20
cents to SDollars 5.75 on reports that it was distributing SDollars 109m to
shareholders.
SEOUL's composite index dipped 4.28 to 517.48 in thin trading. Turnover came
to Won121bn, against Won142bn during Saturday's half-day session. Declines
outscored gains by 486 to 213.
TAIWAN retreated on profit-taking and the weighted index, which had gained
more than 50 points earlier in the day, closed 10.63 down at 4,008.22.
Turnover amounted to TDollars 23.94bn, after Saturday's TDollars 17.5bn.
MANILA gained ground on optimism about the prospects for economic recovery.
The composite index climbed 11.71 to 1,475.10. Advances outnumbered declines
by 46 to 25.

Bank lost 5 pesos to 290 pesos, while Philippine Long Distance Telephone
added 10 pesos at 1,040 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR fell in dull trading. The composite index lost 3.83 to 589.70.
Falls led gains by 180 to 51 as volume shrank to 52m shares from Friday's
70m. Investors took profits in Telekom, which declined 30 cents to MDollars
13.40.
AUSTRALIA eased as investors remained cautious ahead of tomorrow's second
quarter inflation figures. The All Ordinaries index slipped 3.3 to 1,606.3
in turnover of ADollars 200.9m.
Among active stocks, BHP fell 6 cents to ADollars 13.46 and News Corp gained
20 cents to ADollars 22.14. GIO, which was listed last week, saw 6.5m shares
traded and weakened 8 cents to ADollars 2.42.
NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index closed 1.78 higher at 1,550.51 in turnover of
NZDollars 33m.
