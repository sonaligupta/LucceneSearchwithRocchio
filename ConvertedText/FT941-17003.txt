FT  06 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclical issues lead Dow to
record level

Wall Street
US stocks, led by cyclical issues, climbed to record levels yesterday
afternoon after investors put aside their initial uneasiness about sagging
bond prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 14.92 ahead at 3,798.82,
compared with the previous high of 3,794.33. But the Standard & Poor's 500
gained only 0.66 at 467.55. The American SE composite firmed 1.43 to 478.79
and the Nasdaq composite rose 3.77 to 778.05. NYSE volume was a very heavy
400m shares.
The advance by blue chips did not come easy. In early trading, concern over
higher interest rates again overshadowed hopes that a strong economy would
boost corporate profits. Strength in manufacturing was again documented by
the Commerce Department, which reported factory orders in November had risen
1.4 per cent, against a consensus forecast of 1.3 per cent.
The robust data, combined with a sharp rise in crude oil prices, assured the
demise of a late rally in bonds seen in the previous session. Inflationary
concerns resurfaced and the 30-year government security had shed  3/4 to 97
5/8 by 4pm.
In spite of the concern over interest rates, stocks most likely to be
rewarded by sustained growth showed steady improvement, pulling the blue
chip barometer into positive territory by late afternoon.
Paper and pulp stocks were strong. International Paper rose Dollars 2 5/8 to
Dollars 72 1/4 and Georgia Pacific Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/4 . Federal
Paperboard added Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 and Boise Cascade Dollars 1
1/2 at Dollars 25 1/8 on 'buy' recommendations from Oppenheimer.
Some oil issues improved on news of higher crude prices. Arco put on Dollars
2 1/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 and Amerada Hess Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 48 3/4 .
Borden dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 16 after its board approved a
sweeping restructuring plan, which includes the disposal of several
businesses and a Dollars 650m charge against fourth-quarter earnings.
Merck, the most active NYSE issue, advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/8
the day after announcing a reorganisation and naming an heir-apparent to its
chairman, Mr P. Roy Vagelos.
The Baby Bell regional telephone groups suffered in the wake of MCI's
decision to compete directly with them. Southwestern Bell was down Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 38 7/8 and USWest Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 43 3/4 . Canada
Toronto surged to a record high for a second consecutive session on a solid
rise in transport and industrial products shares. The TSE 300 index climbed
32.5 to 4,401.1 and volume was an extremely brisk 98.2m shares valued at
CDollars 990m.
