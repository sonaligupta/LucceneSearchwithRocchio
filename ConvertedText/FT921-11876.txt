FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Share sales lift earnings at
Advance Bank

ADVANCE Bank Australia has become one of the few Australian banks to report
earnings growth in the latest period. However, the Sydney-based bank had to
rely on an abnormal gain from share sales for its progress, writes Bruce
Jacques in Sydney.
Advance yesterday reported a 13 per cent rise to ADollars 20.6m (USDollars
15.4m) for the November half, from ADollars 18.2m. The result came on a 4
per cent increase in revenue, to ADollars 141.2m from ADollars 135.5m. The
interim dividend increased to 14 cents from 13 cents a share.
The result included a ADollars 3.4m pre-tax profit on share sales. In
contrast to most of its larger rivals, Advance reduced its bad and doubtful
debt provisions by 19 per cent to ADollars 14.3m in the half.
Net non-performing loans were virtually static at ADollars 139.7m, and tax
accounted for ADollars 12.4m against ADollars 10.8m. Depreciation charges
eased to ADollars 8.3m from ADollars 9.1m.
BOND Corporation, the troubled Australian conglomerate once run by Mr Alan
Bond, has confirmed the scheduled sale of its half-share in Australia's
first private university - Bond University - to EIE International, an
offshoot of the Japanese property conglomerate.
