FT  29 JAN 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank plans to increase
dividend payout


   By DAVID WALLER


   FRANKFURT


DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's largest bank, said yesterday it planned to increase
its dividend for 1991 by DM1 to DM15 (Dollars 9.28) per share, writes David
Waller in Frankfurt.
The bank said that the decision to raise the pay-out reflected satisfactory
1991 profits. Last month, it reported operating profits up 22 per cent to
DM5.2bn for the first 10months of 1991 and said it expected a 23 per cent
increase to DM6.3bn for the whole year.
Germany's large banks all reported good figures at the 10-month stage, a
result of strong demand for credit, high interest rates, and strong results
from own-account trading. But Deutsche Bank is the only bank to commit
itself to a dividend increase.
One reason why Deutsche Bank is able to raise the pay-out is that it took
early steps to make large provisions against its uninsured exposure to the
former Soviet Union.
