FT  28 APR 94 / Top US adviser on Haiti to step down


   By AP


   WASHINGTON


The US State Department's top adviser on Haiti is stepping down following a
prolonged conflict with exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide over how to
return democratic rule to Haiti, AP reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Pezzullo decided to resign after meeting US secretary of state
Warren Christopher on Saturday, according to the State Department.
Mr Pezzullo is a former foreign service officer who was called out of
retirement last year to become special adviser on Haiti. Almost from the
outset, his relations with Mr Aristide were strained by tactical
differences.
Mr Pezzullo urged Mr Aristide to reach out to opposition forces in Haiti as
a means of broadening his base with the aim of leaving the Haitian military
increasingly isolated.
But Mr Aristide rejected such an approach. He believed the US should take
the lead in arranging for his return to power. He has been a strong
proponent of tighter economic sanctions against Haiti.
Several members of Congress' black caucus sided with Mr Aristide and urged
that Mr Pezzullo resign, holding him responsible for the continuing impasse.
Mr Pezzullo is a former ambassador to Nicaragua.
