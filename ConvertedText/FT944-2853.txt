FT  15 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid hint sparks Recs


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN


Bid fever gripped the regional electricity companies (recs) sector after
international conglomerate Trafalgar House confirmed recent speculation that
it is considering making a takeover bid for Northern Electricity.
The stock moved sharply ahead at the outset fuelled by continued bid talk.
Momentum was lost briefly around midday when Northern said it knew of no
substance for the rumours. Two hours later Trafalgar confirmed that it was
considering a bid and Northern showed a 122p gain before coming off the top
to close a net 100 ahead at 1010p on volume of 4.3m.
Much of the activity was said to have been executed by Swiss Bank Corp,
Trafalgar's advisers, who were thought by rival dealers to have built up a
near 3 per cent stake in Northern over the past few weeks.
Analysts said Trafalgar may have to launch a rights issue to fund the
acquisition. Commentators pointed to 25 per cent stakeholder Hong Kong Land
and its parent Jardine Matheson as possible underwriters.
But one specialist warned that Trafalgar's move was an attempt to take
advantage of Northern's cash position. 'It may find that the regulator might
put a ring fence around the company to prevent it from getting at the cash.'
Another viewed it simply as a way for Hong Kong Land to move funds into the
UK before 1997.
The general view remained that Trafalgar's move is the opening shot in what
is likely to be a long and drawn out battle. Yorkshire, 26 up at 741p, and
Scottish Power, 11 1/2 ahead at 343p, were mentioned as the most likely
white knights. Southern, 30 higher at 786p, was also seen as a possible
contender, as was Hanson, which gained a penny at 228p. A two-way pull in
Trafalgar brought volume of 19m as the shares put on a penny at 72p.
The excitement brought about by the move on Northern Electricity ignited
takeover speculation in the rest of the sector. South West jumped 55 to 843p
and South Wales raced ahead 41 to 827p. Manweb, which reported a 40 per cent
dividend increase, strengthened 51 to 831p on the bid talk.
Composite insurers received a boost from a UBS valuation which landed on
clients' desks yesterday morning and argued that the sector as a whole was
undervalued by 16 per cent.
The research, part of an ongoing model that has been 'back tested' against
performances since 1981, highlighted General Accident. Analyst Mr
Christopher Hitchings commented: 'When we launched the model in the summer,
GA was not good value, but since then it has underperformed massively.' Mr
Hitchings turned buyer of the stock and the shares bounced 22 to 516p.
Elsewhere, Commercial Union gained 18 at 513p, Sun Alliance 10 at 302p and
Guardian Royal Exchange 5 at 176p. Dealers said SGST was also recommending
the sector.
Oil major British Petroleum advanced 9 to 412 1/2 p as investors took heart
from a key presentation to analysts. The profits forecasts matched those
already in place but the market liked the commitment to reduce debts.
Smith New Court was recommending the stock, arguing that the company's
estimates implied gearing of only 37 per cent by 1996, down from 59 per cent
in the third quarter. SGST also came away talking of 'an impressive
performance revealing steady progress'.
Elsewhere in the utilities, shares in Southern Water moved ahead 31 to 570p
after the group reported favourable figures.
Merchant bank SG Warburg finished 14 stronger at 798p, with some dealers
suggesting that an announcement over the possibility of a link with Morgan
Stanley, of the US, would come on Monday.
Until an announcement is made the shares will reflect the various views in
the market over Warburg's potential valuation. Some analysts argue that at
current levels the shares are already at a premium to the fundamental
valuation. Others believe the lower rating of Morgan Stanley will be
countered by Warburg's enhanced earnings and net assets.
Cazenove has apparently been putting the case for Warburg shares to trade
around 700p. However, Credit Lyonnais Laing cites the takeover of Morgan
Grenfell by Deutsche Bank which, at 2.4 times book value, would suggest a
take-out price around Pounds 11. Warburg's fund management arm Mercury Asset
Management rose a further 27 to 745p.
Some concern over Royal Bank of Scotland's insurance arm saw the Scottish
clearer's shares slip 4 1/2 to 399 1/2 p.
Transport group NFC climbed strongly for the second day running, adding 7 at
160p following the purchase of a large line of shares by a board member.
Turnover was 4.1m shares, and the stock has now risen almost 9 per cent in
two sessions.
Newly floated TeleWest Communications hardened to 179 1/2 p in 2.1m turnover
to modestly reverse the recent run of weakness, which at one stage yesterday
left the shares 4 short of their 182p issue price.
Traders suggested that TeleWest had been supported by Kleinwort Benson,
joint issue broker, which has until December 30 to smooth the market in the
shares.
The stock market's feeling was that TeleWest had suffered from a flow-back
from the US tranche of the issue in the wake of the continued weakness of
telecom stocks on Wall Street.
Vodafone added 2 1/2 at 197p in 9m turnover, while BT rounded off an active
day for the sector, rising 4 to 373 1/2 p in 7.3m shares traded.
Building materials leader Caradon recovered following a buy recommendation
from UBS which said the recent derating has left the shares cheap on both
yield and balance sheet criteria. They finished 6 higher at 234p after 3.5m
turnover.
British Steel was the most actively traded Footsie stock, ending 3 3/4 ahead
at 156 3/4 p in turnover of 14m. Similarly, British Aerospace regained all
and more of Tuesday's sell-off, rising 7 1/2 to 427 1/2 p, with Kleinwort
Benson placing the 3m shares not taken up within the recent rights issue.
Among smaller engineering stocks, Whessoe forged ahead 15 to 121p for a
two-day advance of 22p.
Food manufacturer Cadbury-Schweppes receded 5 to 404p in heavy trading of
7.7m shares, with Hoare Govett, the group's broker, cutting current year
profits expectations. BZW also reduced its forecast but remains a buyer.
Shares in train set manufacturer Hornby hit the buffers after the USM-quoted
company issued a profits warning. The stock fell 50 to 127p.
Brokers' downgradings left furniture group MFI trailing 2 1/2 at 122p.
