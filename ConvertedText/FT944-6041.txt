FT  01 DEC 94 / Halt to political funding urged

   PARIS


The Patronat, France's employers' federation, yesterday called on French
companies to suspend financial contributions to political parties in
response to a wave of corruption investigations which have shaken the
country's business community since the beginning of the year. Mr Francois
Perigot, president of the employers' body, said that until the government
had set new rules governing contributions to political parties it was best
to halt payments. 'The situation is too ambiguous. We must stop the
funding,' he said. Last month, Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, announced it had
halted political contributions. Other construction and utilities groups, the
biggest campaign contributors, are also reviewing their position.
