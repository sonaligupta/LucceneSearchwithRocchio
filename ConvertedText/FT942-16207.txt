FT  12 APR 94 / Minister delays art export licences


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, yesterday deferred the granting
of export licences on four works of art, giving art galleries and museums
time to raise the money needed to keep them in the UK.
Three of the works have had their export licences delayed until the end of
next month. They are: The Miraculous Translation of the Holy House of
Loreto, an oil sketch by Tiepolo, for which Pounds 3.2m must be raised to
keep it in the UK; St Sebastian Succoured by Two Angels, by the 17th century
Italian artist Guercino (Pounds 400,000); and a pastel portrait of the 4th
Duchess of Marlborough, by Gainsborough (Pounds 236,919).
A marble bust of Lady Harriet Pellew by Bertel Thorwaldsen, with a price tag
of Pounds 170,404, has had an export licence delayed until the end of June.
The Hoxne Hoard, the Roman treasure found in Suffolk in 1992 and one of the
finest in the UK, has been deposited in the British Museum. The National
Heritage Fund and the National Art Collections Fund contributed to the
Pounds 1.75m needed to meet the treasure trove reward.
