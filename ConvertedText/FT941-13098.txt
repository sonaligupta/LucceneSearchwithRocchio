FT  27 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan strikes a
chord with Asian teenagers - South-east Asia is lacking homegrown talent,
but Japan is ready to entertain


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


For years Japan's entertainment industry has been trying to reach out to a
western audience, sending its starlets on a mission to perform in Las Vegas
and Hollywood. But such efforts have been big flops.
Now, however, the industry has discovered Asia. Along with the country's
manufacturers, Japanese record companies, television networks and artist
management groups are turning to the rapidly growing Asian market.
Masahisa Aizawa, vice-president of Sun Music, a Japanese production agency,
says the entertainment industry in Asia has not caught up with the rapid
economic growth and the deluge of electronic hardware. 'Asia's entertainment
industry is behind Japan by about 15 years,' he says.
Sun Music was surprised at the popularity of Noriko Sakai, one of its
Japanese pop idols, among Taiwanese teenagers. Sakai recently became top
pin-up star in Taiwan, prompting the agency to work with a Taiwanese
television network to produce a drama starring the idol.
Until recently, Japan has been excessively cautious about exporting
entertainment software to Asia. Many of the older people in south-east Asian
countries still remember being forced to learn Japanese by the Japanese army
in the second world war, and South Korea still bans Japanese songs and
literature from its stores.
Younger Asians, however, crave news out of Tokyo. 'Tokyo is for Asia what
New York was for Japan 20 years ago,' says Eisuke Saito, managing director
of Amuse, another production agency, which organised concerts by Japanese
artists in Beijing last year.
Such is the demand that video tapes of Japanese television programmes are
sold in Taiwan video shops, Japanese soap operas are aired in Singapore and
Japanese songs sung on karaoke machines.
Harry Kaneko of Pony Canyon, a Japanese record company, believes that the
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) record market in Asia will grow threefold in the
next seven years. In contrast, marked growth in Japan's Dollars 4bn record
market is unlikely.
Japanese entertainment-related companies are keen to cash in on such demand,
and stress that there is little room for western corporations. 'Japan is
closer than the US or Europe, and besides, similar physique of the Japanese
people brings us closer to Asia than Caucasians,' says Aizawa. He also
claims the rhythm and melody lines of songs in south-east Asia are basically
the same.
Aside from bringing Japanese talent to Asia, the Japanese are eager to
capture the Chinese-speaking market including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
Malaysia and Thailand, by offering Chinese artists. Saito reckons the global
Chinese-speaking population totals some 1.6bn.
Many in the industry point out that Hong Kong and Taiwan are important
strategic areas for subsidiaries to distribute software throughout
south-east Asia. Pony Canyon is building a network in Asia to search for
potential Asian pop and rock stars.
Japanese production agencies are searching for talent in China to sell to
the Chinese communities. Production agency HoriPro, teamed with a Hong Kong
agency, recently organised a nationwide amateur talent search contest in
China. Events organised by local television stations were held in 19
regional cities. The semifinals and finals were held in Beijing, and
broadcast live to other parts of Asia through Hong Kong's satellite Star TV.
Kazutaka Hori, vice-president of HoriPro, explains that the project was also
backed by the Chinese authorities, since 'China never really had its own
stars and artists. They all came from Hong Kong and Taiwan'.
Amuse has also arranged a contest, with the finals to be held this month.
'We want to train and bring up people with talent for the Asian market,'
says Saito.
Exporting Japanese software and know-how in the entertainment business has
struck a chord with the Japanese hardware makers. Matsushita Electric
Industrial is using Sakai of Sun Music to sell its electronic products in
China and south-east Asia, while other consumer electronics companies are
lining up to become sponsors of the China talent search contests.
A concern in the Japanese entertainment market is the absence of copyright
protection in the region. Although China is trying to improve its
enforcement of copyright law, more than 800 companies produce pirate
cassette tapes. Others, such as some Taiwanese companies, have been blamed
for distorting the legitimate market.
Japanese companies, however, see the advantage of establishing themselves in
the region before this problem is solved. 'Once proper laws on copyright are
laid out, there will be profits that did not exist before,' says Hori.
