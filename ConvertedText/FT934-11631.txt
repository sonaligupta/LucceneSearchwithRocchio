FT  30 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rail privatisation, with BR as a
bidder, is route to necessary investment


   From Lord MOUNTEVANS


Sir, Your editorial 'Right lines for rail privatisation' (October 21)
unintentionally highlights the huge pitfalls that surround railway
privatisation.
One of the benefits of the proposals (and the reason I have supported them
in the House of Lords) is that they should open access to private capital
for the expansion of railway investment which is needed now.
You point out that Sir Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, wants to involve
private finance for infrastructure investment, yet while Railtrack remains
in the public sector he will presumably be subject to the same constraints
as is BR currently.
You acknowledge that short franchises are unlikely to attract the investment
needed in new rolling stock, so where will the investment come from?
I would also challenge your view on Lord Peyton's amendment (which I
supported), allowing BR to bid. The experience in Sweden, where this has
been tried, is that the state railway, SJ, did indeed secure the majority of
franchises, but that the stimulus of competition both improved services and
helped to reduce costs by some 30 per cent.
It must be in the interests of the taxpayer for private bids to be tested
against those of BR. It is certainly important in terms of the motivation
and morale of the many railway staff that will remain with BR that it should
not be seen as a 'rump' operator, managing those parts of the network that
are scorned by the private sector.
While those of us in parliament can legislate for privatisation, its
successful implementation depends on the enthusiastic co-operation and
participation of those who work for British Rail.
Mountevans,
House of Lords,
