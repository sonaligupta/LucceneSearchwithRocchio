FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Banesto sells Asturiana de Zinc shares at
discount to market price


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


The sale of shares in Asturiana de Zinc, the world's fourth-largest zinc
producer, by its parent, Banesto, the Spanish industrial holding group, is
to go ahead but at a discount to the market price.
Banesto yesterday priced the Asturiana shares at Pta1,515 each compared with
Tuesday's close of Pta1,550. The group previously indicated it hoped to sell
at Pta1,600 a share.
The sale will raise about Dollars 109m for Banesto and reduce its holding in
Asturiana from 62.39 per cent to 39 per cent.
Analysts said Banesto did well to get the Asturiana sale away, given present
weak market conditions which in the past two weeks have forced two other
mining companies - Samax and Union Miniere - to shelve share offers.
Banesto, whose parent Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto, was acquired for
Dollars 2bn earlier this year by Banco Santander, sold 23 per cent of
Asturiana in September, to a group of international investors for Dollars
82.6m or Pta1,500 a share.
Asturiana is the subject of a financial restructuring which includes the
placement of shares to Banesto to compensate for the cancellation of
Pta15.24bn (Dollars 115m) in loans that the zinc company has outstanding
from Banesto.
The latest offer is open to institutional investors and to Asturiana
shareholders who are entitled to one share for every 15 held.
Asturiana operates the world's largest zinc smelter in Spain, with an annual
capacity of 320,000 tonnes. This year it will produce about 250,000 tonnes
of zinc but management suggests this could rise to 300,000 tonnes in 1995.
