FT  21 JUL 94 / Technology: For men only


   By DANIEL GREEN


Unofficial estimates suggest that more than 50m men in Europe and the US
suffer from impotence. The true figure could be much higher because it is a
condition that many are reluctant to discuss with their doctors.
Most sufferers go untreated not least because there are no attractive
remedies available. The only drugs sanctioned by health regulatory
authorities are muscle relaxants that improve blood flow to the penis. They
must be given by injection and the effect lasts an hour or so.
But now, clinical trials have started on a pill which might do the trick.
Texas biotechnology company Zonagen has obtained a licence to commercialise
research conducted by Adrian Zorgniotti, professor of clinical urology at
New York University School of Medicine.
He worked on drugs that had a much more modest effect than the injection.
Zonagen's compound seems simply to make a man more likely to achieve an
erection rather than trigger an uncontrolled response.
It also seems to be more effective with men who suffer from impotence than
those who do not, providing some reassurance to health regulators who fear
that the drug will find a market as an aphrodisiac.
But apart from a physiological response, little is known about how it works,
admits Joseph Podolski, Zonagen's president. The tablet takes effect about
15 minutes after being swallowed and works best with men whose impotence
derives from psychological problems or poor arterial blood flow.
Even its name is under wraps while Zonagen tries to secure patent
protection. It was originally developed in the 1950s as a heart treatment
and Zonagen fears that without the threat of patent action, manufacturers of
the heart treatment will simply offer a tablet version.
At least the trial results should be clear quickly, says Podolski, and a
product could be on the market within two years.
