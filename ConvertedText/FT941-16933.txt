FT  07 JAN 94 / Vote threatens union merger


   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor


A merger designed to create one of the most powerful management unions in
Britain was jeopardised yesterday when delegates from one of the unions
voted to unravel the deal.
The merger of the Engineers' and Managers' Association, the 30,000-strong
electricity industry-based union, with the 5,000-strong British Association
of Colliery Management, was due to be concluded next Monday.
Yet in spite of an overwhelming vote - 4,017 to 211 - in favour of the
merger by Bacom members in September, a delegate conference of 60 members in
Nottingham yesterday backed a motion rejecting it.
The motion, moved by Mr Doug Bulmer, Bacom president, maintains that
assurances about Bacom independence within the merged union cannot be relied
upon. Neither Mr John Meads, leader of Bacom, nor Mr Tony Cooper, leader of
the EMA, was available for comment yesterday.
But senior union officials said a personality clash between Mr Bulmer and Mr
Cooper lay behind the move to unravel the deal.
It is unclear whether yesterday's decision can override a vote by the whole
Bacom membership. If, as still seems likely, the formal merger does go ahead
next week, legal action is likely to commence.
This latest union merger problem comes soon after the emergence of
infighting between the engineering workers and electricians in the AEEU
craft union merger.
Ironically the EMA, with other management unions such as the IPMS civil
service union and the STE telecommunications union, has pioneered a looser
form of amalgamation, designed to allow unions to share services and save
money without losing their identities.
