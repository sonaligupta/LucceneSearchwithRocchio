FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Plunge continues in UK farmers'
incomes


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


UK FARM INCOMES plunged by 14 per cent last year to Pounds 1.22bn, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture's annual report.
The figure, which reflects income for farmers and their spouses, compares
with Pounds 1.5bn in 1989 and a peak of more than Pounds 2bn in 1984.
Total income from farming, which includes earning attributable to partners,
directors and other family workers, fell by 6 per cent to Pounds 2.17bn.
Mr John Gummer, the minister of agriculture, said 1991 was not an easy year
for British farmers, who continued to face uncertainty over the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy and the Uruguay round of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. While agricultural productivity continued to
rise (by 3 per cent), farm incomes had been hit by increased input prices
(up almost 4 per cent) and lower returns (averaging 1 per cent).
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said the report
made grim reading.
'These income statistics are appalling. They not only confirm the downward
trend of the past years but bring the industry's real income to its lowest
level since the last world war,' he said. The fall was all the more worrying
because it had occurred in spite of a better harvest in some parts of the
country.
The number of full-time farmers continues to fall and now stands at 178,000
compared with 183,000. The industry's bank loans and overdrafts stood at
Pounds 6.55bn at the end of December 1990, compared with Pounds 6.4bn the
year before. But the fall in interest rates last year reduced interest
charges to Pounds 899m from Pounds 1.05bn in 1990.
The report says the fortunes of different types of farm across the UK varied
considerably. 'In most of the country cereal and cropping farms fared
relatively well in 1991, but in Scotland the high yields of the previous
year have not been repeated and incomes are forecast to fall.'
Livestock farm incomes had improved, while those on dairy farms had
declined. Pig and poultry farmers had suffered a sharp reduction in prices.
