FT  24 NOV 92 / UK Company News: National Grid in Pounds 100m investment


   By MICHAEL SMITH


NATIONAL GRID, which manages the electricity system in England and Wales,
yesterday outlined plans for an initial Pounds 100m investment in its
planned telecommunications network as it disclosed a 7.3 per cent rise in
interim pre-tax profits.
Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said that Pounds 100m had been earmarked for
investing in the next 18 months on the alternative telephone network for
large users.
Talks on potential collaboration on the project were in progress with three
North American companies with marketing and networking experience.
However, Mr Jefferies warned against City expectations of rapid returns,
saying that a market share of less than 1 per cent was likely in the first
few years.
Approval for the project, Telecom Electric, was given last week by 12
regional electricity companies which own the National Grid Company.
At the same time it decided against flotation of NGC.
In the six months to September 30, the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds
261.6m, against Pounds 243.7m in the corresponding period of last year on a
historical cost basis.
Turnover was Pounds 666.3m (Pounds 655m).
The interim dividend goes up 10.5 per cent at a cost of Pounds 42m, against
Pounds 38m last time.
Some analysts believe the RECs are unlikely to go below this percentage rise
when they fix their dividends this month and next.
Current cost operating profit of Pounds 179m, up 4.6 per cent, reflected an
improved contribution from the pumped storage and interconnections business,
offsetting a reduction in transmission revenue.
Part of the improvement was due to cost reductions. NGC expects staffing to
be about 5,500 by the end of the financial year and 5,000 by March 1994,
against 6,600 when it was formed.
