FT  08 NOV 94 / Passenger increase fuels BAA rise


   By SIMON DAVIES


A 7 per cent increase in airline passengers helped fuel a Pounds 28m rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 265m, at privatised airports group BAA during the
six months ended September.
Its shares fell 24 1/2 p to 492 1/2 p, although the figures were in line
with expectations, and BAA remained positive on the outlook for passenger
growth and retail spending.
Capital expenditure was Pounds 201m as the group continued its three-year
investment programme estimated at Pounds 1.4bn. Net debt rose to Pounds 790m
(Pounds 739m), while gearing remained less than 30 per cent.
The company said the recent collapse of a tunnel at Heathrow - part of a
Pounds 300m project to develop a high-speed rail link to central London -
was unlikely to have a meaningful financial impact as the tunnel was four
months ahead of schedule.
Group turnover rose 5.3 per cent to Pounds 660m (Pounds 627m). Revenue from
traffic and airport charges increased by Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 278.4m. It
was held back by its regulatory price formula, which reduced prices by 4 per
cent below the Retail Price Index.
For the next two years, however, the formula shifts in BAA's favour, with
potential increases of 1 per cent below RPI. In addition, a combination of
economic recovery and aggressive competition for passengers within the
airline industry should ensure further growth.
The company benefited from continued delays in the opening of the Channel
tunnel, which is expected to absorb around 3 per cent of BAA's passengers,
or around 2.6m passengers, once it is fully operational.
Retail revenue rose from Pounds 250.1m to Pounds 273.2m, with average
passenger spending 7.8 per cent more than a year earlier. The figures were
hit by the effects of construction at Terminals 1 and 2 at Heathrow, but
sales should recover strongly once the disruption ceases, over the next two
years.
Property income rose 9.3 per cent to Pounds 80m (Pounds 73m), because of
rent from Compass Point.
The company has kept tight control on costs, with a 5.3 per cent increase in
passengers per employee, versus a 5.7 per cent increase in staff costs per
employee.
BAA reported mixed fortunes from its overseas operations. Its Pittsburgh
operations have performed well, but it recently turned down a similar
contract in Philadelphia, 'because it was not profitable enough'.
The company has offices in Hong Kong and Australia to look at investment
opportunities, and Sir John Egan, chief executive, said any meaningful
investment outside the UK would be funded through equity.
The company announced an interim dividend of 3.75p (3.375p), up 11 per cent
while earnings per share rose to 19.2p (17.1p).
