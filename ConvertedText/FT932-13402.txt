FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Top pay awards reflect a system in need of change -
and a rising workload (3)


   From Mr COLIN COULSON-THOMAS


Sir, Your editorial (April 20) suggests that directors' pay is 'over the
top', while Lucy Kellaway refers to 'allegations of directors' greed'. The
evidence cited is a survey finding that directors' remuneration has
increased during a period of recession.
As well as causing a widespread fall in profitability, the economic
recession has subjected many directors and boards to considerable pressures.
Directors have onerous duties and responsibilities, and when corporate
survival is at stake these come to the fore. I know many directors who have
faced greater challenges over the past three years than at any time in their
directorial careers.
The tough choices that result from a difficult trading environment
invariably end up in the boardroom. I would expect the demands upon
directors, and their workloads, to increase at a time of economic adversity,
and I suspect the remuneration of many directors reflects this.
