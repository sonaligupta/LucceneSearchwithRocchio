FT  30 NOV 94 / International Company News: US aerospace groups join forces
on shuttle

Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace companies, are to join forces
in bidding for the next generation of space shuttle. The contract for the
initial development phase of the new vehicle, the X-33, is expected to be
awarded before the year-end, writes Tony Jackson in New York.
The 13-month contract will seek to design a vehicle which can be turned
round as quickly as an aircraft between missions and does away with costly
and complex ground support, the companies said. It is unclear whether the
X-33 will ever go into production. If it does, the choice of manufacturer is
expected to be made by NASA in 1996.
The companies, both of which are already active in space programmes, said
they would share costs and profits on an equal basis. The programme manager,
Dr William Gaubatz, will be supplied by McDonnell Douglas.
