FT  04 AUG 92 / Germany beocmes first European country to destroy cold war
arsenal


   By REUTER


   ROCHENSUSSRA


Germany yesterday became the first European country to start destroying its
cold war arsenal when officials lit a cutting torch to destroy a Soviet-made
armoured car and a cannon, Reuter reports from Rochensussra.
Defence Minister Volker Ruhe (centre) and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
(right) had to jump back from a massive BTR-40 P2 armoured personnel carrier
(APC) as sparks showered over them.
'There is no place any more in a Europe of democratic states and pluralistic
societies for over-armament and the bulging arsenals of the cold war,' Mr
Ruhe said at the ceremony in the village near Erfurt in Thuringen state.
Mr Kinkel said: 'This day is a symbol for the victory of reason and morality
over confrontation and the arms race.'
The APC and the 125mm Howitzer cut apart in Rochensussra, once behind the
Iron Curtain, were the first of about 40,000 tanks, artillery and
helicopters that European states will destroy by late 1995.
