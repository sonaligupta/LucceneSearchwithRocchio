FT  25 MAR 92 / Letter: Economic options for industry - and the cold water
horror (1)


   From Mr IAN R FOX


Sir, Your paper's comment and assessments of the Labour party's budget
proposals are objective insofar as they are based on theoretical economics.
There is, however, from an industrial viewpoint, a choice to be made in
budget terms between the two main parties when the key facts are considered.
The UK and western economies are mature markets and, therefore, future rates
of economic growth are likely to be downwards from those of the last 30
years.
Any recovery in the UK will be consumer and not investment nor export led.
The rate of corporation tax and weakness of world markets prevent it being
otherwise.
The southern half of the country, through commitment to the housing market
and mortgages, has been hardest hit in recession. Potentially this is the
engine for recovery in the UK, but little or no comment is made on the
effect of the Labour party proposals on this.
The shadow chancellor's proposals for national insurance and income tax must
surely represent the largest proportional increase in taxation history.
They are, therefore, highly significant, as the proportional effect will
have as great an impact as the absolute numbers. At a stroke the proposals
reinstate an effective standard income tax rate of 34 per cent and put many
taxpayers back to where they were in 1979.
There is, therefore, a real choice for the electorate to vote either for a
redistribution of wealth now or long-term improvements through wealth
creation.
The impact of these choices needs to be spelt out and debated by
commentators and, one hopes, politicians.
