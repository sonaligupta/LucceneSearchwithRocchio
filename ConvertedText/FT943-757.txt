FT  28 SEP 94 / Leading indicators point to expansion

Japan's index of leading economic indicators stood at 60.0 in July, the
seventh straight month it was above the so-called 'boom-or-bust' threshold
of 50.0, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) announced yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Tokyo
The EPA considers a reading above 50 as auguring economic expansion over the
short term but a level below 50 as heralding contraction.
The June leading index was revised by the agency from the preliminary 54.5
and May revised from the preliminary 58.3.
An agency official briefing reporters on the data said there was no change
in the agency's assessment that 'there is an increasing chance that the
economy is entering a new phase'.
He also suggested that the coincident indicator, a key component in the
index measuring the present state of the economy, stands a strong chance of
exceeding 50 in August, as the forecast by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry for a 1.6 per cent jump in industrial output would push
that component of the index from negative to positive territory.
Among components of the leading index, the counter-cyclical final
demand-to-inventories index changed from negative to positive in July, the
only part of the index that shifted direction from a month earlier.
