FT  17 JAN 92 / Observer: Staying power


Recognition at last] Vincas Bilickas, who for over 50 of his 87 years has
unoffically represented Lithuania in Britain, is to be recognised as his
country's ambassador by the Queen.
The first envoy to be appointed to the Court of St James by one of the newly
independent Baltic states, he originally came to London in 1938 as a
commercial counsellor. A year later the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact gave
Lithuania to the Soviets.
Bilickas stayed put, along with the ambassador Bronius Balutis, becoming
head of mission when his chief died in the 1960s. Although the UK foreign
office allowed him personal diplomatic privileges, deeming him a charge
d'affaires, he was not recognised as Lithuania's envoy nor, of course,
invited to diplomatic parties.
He'll no doubt make up for it after presenting his letters to the Queen on
February 11. But, while he wouldn't say so himself, a better date might have
been chosen.
Five days later comes Lithuania's longstanding Independence Day - one of the
two occasions each year on which Bilickas has stead-
fastly raised his faded yellow, green and red national flag over the
legation. The other is Her Majesty's birthday.
