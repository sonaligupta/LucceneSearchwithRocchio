MCDONALD'S, the world's biggest hamburger chain, yesterday posted a 14 per
cent rise in second-quarter earnings on sales which rose 11 per cent and
said it was on track with its plan to achieve double-digit earnings growth.
In the three months to June 30, the company earned Dollars 288.8m, or 78
cents a share on sales of Dollars 5.96bn compared with profits Dollars
254.1m, or 69 cents on sales of Dollars 5.39bn in the same period of 1992.
Revenues, which are less than sales because of franchising agreements, were
6 per cent higher at Dollars 1.88bn in the latest quarter. Operating income
grew 8 per cent to Dollars 517.8m from Dollars 478m a year ago.
For the first six months, McDonald's had net income of Dollars 507.1m, or
Dollars 1.35 on sales of Dollars 11.19bn against earnings of Dollars 441.5m,
or Dollars 1.20 on sales of Dollars 10.3bn the previous year.
Revenues rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.53bn from Dollars 3.39bn.
The Illinois-based company said its international business was helped by
expansion and higher sales at existing restaurants, but was hurt by weaker
foreign currencies.
Sales outside the US rose 15 per cent in the quarter. US sales grew 8 per
cent in the quarter while operating income rose 4 per cent.
The company said it had excellent sales results in many European countries
and attributed its success in weak economies to the value of its meals.
In England, 'sales growth over the past several quarters has been
noteworthy', the company said.
In Japan, however, McDonald's blamed a weak economy for soft sales.
Operating income outside the US rose 15 per cent in the quarter.
The company said higher general, administrative and selling expenses partly
offset higher franchised margins.
