FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonald's earnings hit new high


   By LAURIE MORSE


McDONALD'S, the world's largest hamburger chain, has reported record
third-quarter earnings. Results were strong in both domestic and overseas
operations, despite weak economies in the UK, Japan and several other of
McDonald's markets.
Third-quarter earnings were Dollars 289.2m, or 79 cents per share, up 12 per
cent from Dollars 258.7m, or 71 cents per share, in the same 1991 quarter.
Worldwide sales hit Dollars 1.9bn, up 11 per cent from Dollars 1.78bn last
year.
For the nine months ended September 20, McDonald's reported earnings of
Dollars 730.7m, or Dollars 1.99 per share, up from Dollars 659.2m, or
Dollars 1.80 per share for the same 1991 period. Year-to-date sales were
Dollars 16.2bn.
McDonald's domestic sales rose 5 per cent for the third quarter, and the
nine-month period, but because of value pricing and an increasingly
competitive environment, earnings in the US were flat.
Outside the US, sales rose 23 per cent in the third quarter, due to
restaurant expansion, currency conversions, and higher sales at existing
units. Earnings rose 21 per cent for offshore operations.
The company said sales were particularly strong in Australia, parts of
western Europe, and parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore.
