FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Southern Water sells stakes to SAUR


   By CLARE PEARSON


Southern Water has sold its minority shareholdings in three local statutory
water companies to SAUR Water Services, the French group which already owns
the majority of their voting capital, writes Clare Pearson.
Mr Martyn Webster, Southern finance director, said the Pounds 10.7m disposal
would give rise to a Pounds 7m exceptional profit in the current year.
He said Southern had built up a close relationship with SAUR, so achieving
the company's original aim when it bought the stakes in the Eastbourne,
Mid-Sussex and West Kent statutory companies between 1987 and 1989.
