FT  16 MAR 94 / French car sales drive pays off


   By JOHN RIDDING

Government measures to stimulate the French motor industry have prompted a
strong response and should result in at least 150,000 extra car orders this
year, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, said yesterday. The measures
include a payment from the government of FFr5,000 (Dollars 870) for car
owners who trade in vehicles more than ten years old to buy a new one,
helping to prompt 54,000 extra orders in February compared with January,
according to Mr Longuet. He forecast continued improvement and estimated
that total car sales this year should exceed 1.9m, compared with 1.72m in
1993. The measures, which also include extra tax breaks for company fleets,
have been matched by discounts from car producers. French manufacturers have
benefited most, with Renault and Peugeot enjoying a stronger increase than
the average 35 per cent. Mr Longuet said it was vital to revive car sales,
which fell more than 18 per cent last year. Mr Longuet said that it was
vital to revive the depressed car sector, which was severely hit by
recession last year and contracted by more than 18 per cent. 'The automobile
sector is one of the principal motors of the economy and represents more
than one million jobs' he said. 'It is an ideal target to help stimulate
consumption.'
