FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: AMR, USAir back in black in
second term

   NEW YORK


TWO of the biggest US airline groups - USAir and AMR, owner of American
Airlines - struggled back into profit in the second quarter of this year
after the effects of a prolonged price war and recession in their home
market.
However, both companies said their results were disappointing, and Mr Robert
Crandall, AMR chairman, called current profit margins 'wholly inadequate'.
He added that AMR's revenues and costs remained 'clearly out of balance. In
the absence of either stronger levels of demand or higher yields, present
trends will not result in satisfactory earnings.'
Mr Seth Schofield, president of USAir, said his company was 'encouraged' by
its improvement in operating income, but added: 'We are disappointed that
our earlier expectations for the second quarter did not materialise due to
sluggish economic conditions.'
The results of both companies were ahead of analysts' expectations, and
helped to push up their shares.
Mr Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said: 'It's an improvement
after last year's devastating fare wars, but they're still not operating in
full recovery mode.'
AMR reported net earnings of Dollars 47m, or 39 cents a share, after taking
a Dollars 79m charge for the retirement of 31 DC-10 aircraft and an
adjustment which added Dollars 67m to passenger revenues.
Leaving aside these factors, earnings were Dollars 59m, or 55 cents a share,
compared with a loss of Dollars 65m, or 86 cents, on a comparable basis in
the 1992 quarter.
For the half-year as a whole, net earnings were Dollars 25m, compared with a
net loss of Dollars 175m in the first six months of 1992.
Revenues in the second quarter reached Dollars 4.21bn, up from Dollars
3.59bn, while the company's yield (the average paid by each passenger to fly
one mile) rose by nearly 11 per cent to 13.77 cents (13.31 cents before the
one-off revenue adjustment). Operating costs climbed by 8 per cent to
Dollars 3.85bn
USAir, in which British Airways has a minority stake, reported net income of
Dollars 5.8m in the three months to the end of June, compared with a loss of
Dollars 131m in the same period in 1992, although this was reduced to
Dollars 12.6m after the cost of paying dividends on preference shares.
The loss per share, after the preference dividend, was 23 cents against
Dollars 3.07 a year ago.
Revenues advanced by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn, while operating expenses
fell by nearly 10 per cent to Dollars 1.75bn. The half-year net loss was
Dollars 72.1m, against Dollars 224.9m in 1992.
