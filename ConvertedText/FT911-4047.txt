FT  22 APR 91 / Letter: Pharmaceutical sector not the best health educator


   From Ms JH EWIN


Sir, Three cheers to Mr Ernest Mario, of Glaxo Holdings, for his article,
'Educating the patient' (April 17) and its presentation of the case for a
well-informed public. A medically aware population should contribute
significantly to greater effectiveness and efficiency within the National
Health Service.
However, I question the role of the pharmaceutical industry as educator.
Having seen some of the campaigns thus sponsored in the US it is hard not to
worry that people are encouraged to focus more on those complaints for which
there are expensive medical cures rather than on some of the more basic
issues of self-help.
The National Health Service was built on the belief that the government and
medical community must provide the medical care maintain the highest
possible level of health among the population. Unfortunately, the public
were never made full partners in this responsibility. Is it not time we
demanded a more direct means of participating in decisions concerning our
living and dying? As a start, we need more and better organised health
education.
If the pharmaceutical industry wishes to contribute to the cost of such an
educational effort, we thank them. But please, do not allow the piecemeal,
illness-oriented public relations efforts of the past masquerade as the
public health education we so desperately need.
