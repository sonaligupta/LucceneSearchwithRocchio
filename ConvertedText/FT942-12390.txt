FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Strube not satisfied with 47%
profits gain at BASF

First-quarter pre-tax profits at BASF, one of the big three German chemical
groups, rose 46.6 per cent to DM349m (Dollars 205m), bolstering hopes that
the European chemical industry is pulling out of a cyclical recession.
However, Mr Jurgen Strube, chief executive, said he was 'not satisfied'
given the poor performance in the comparable period a year ago.
BASF is the last of the big three to report first-quarter results. Hoechst
saw pre-tax profits rise 16 per cent to DM506m while Bayer revealed a 18 per
cent rise to DM755m.
Mr Strube said rising demand and cost-cutting would enable the company to
meet its profit forecasts for 1994.
'We will continue our efforts to examine all costs with a view to further
lowering fixed costs and improving the organisation,' Mr Strube said.
BASF pre-tax profits totalled DM1.06bn in 1993. Foreign sales rose 5 per
cent to DM7.6bn while domestic demand fell 6.4 per cent to DM3bn. Group
turnover rose 2.1 per cent to DM11.27bn while turnover at the parent company
rose 5.1 per cent to DM4.7bn.
BASF is more dependent on oil prices than Hoechst or Bayer and it said that
while demand in Germany was picking up slightly the 3.4 per cent fall in
first-quarter turnover was due to falling oil prices.
Higher returns on gas trading could not compensate for lower oil prices, the
company said.
Sales of synthetics and fibres rose 10.6 per cent and the chemicals division
was 'positive' with turnover up 10.5 per cent. Demand for agricultural
products fell 15.5 per cent.
The company said investment in 1994 would be reduced to DM3.2bn and would be
focused more on Asian markets.
BASF shed 2,495 jobs in the quarter, reducing total workforce to 112,020
people.
It said its foam plastics and polyurethane were developing 'especially well'
and that the product range had been extended following the takeover in March
of the European polypropylene division of ICI of the UK.
