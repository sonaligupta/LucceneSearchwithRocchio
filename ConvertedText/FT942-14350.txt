FT  20 APR 94 / World Trade News: Singapore may build Vietnam zone


   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor


Singapore may build an industrial park in Vietnam, along the lines of those
it already has under way in China and India, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean
prime minister, said yesterday.
He told a business conference in London that Vietnam wanted Singapore to
build a zone similar to, but smaller than, the industrial township which it
is constructing at Suzhou in China's Jiangsu province. But Mr Goh said
Vietnam would have to offer domestic market access to companies which set up
plants in such a zone.
Singapore plans to invest as much as 30 per cent of its reserves in Asia,
under its policy of developing an 'external wing' to its economy. Most of
its efforts are going to develope industrial parks in China, India and
Indonesia, and market them to foreign companies as an efficient way to
participate in Asia's rapid growth.
