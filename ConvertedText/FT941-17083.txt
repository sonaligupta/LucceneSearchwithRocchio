FT  06 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television


   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY


BBC2 continues its week of Dance For The Camera in which short ballets are
created expressly for television, with 'Beethoven In Love' by choreographer
and dancer Liz Aggiss (7.15). The first episode of BBC1's hospital comedy
Health And Efficiency (which, for the information of those who were
schoolboys in the 1950s, contains not a single naked lady toying with a
beach ball) looked pretty promising, mainly because it exploits all the
lunacies of today's market-driven healthcare schemes (8.00).
Perhaps George Cole's 'last' series of Minder will prove no more final than
Dame Nellie Melba's farewell concerts, but no doubt we shall watch just in
case. There are 10 episodes, starting tonight with a yarn in which Arthur is
looking for capital to finance a nice little earner involving freezers,
mopeds, and a Sicilian called The Pizza Man (8.30 ITV).
VCRs will be needed at 9.00 when a new series of David Jessel's Trial And
Error series (C4) on miscarriages of justice clashes with the first in The
All New Alexei Sayle Show (BBC2). Sayle may one day be seen as the most
inspired comedian of his generation.
