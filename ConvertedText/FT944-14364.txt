Human rights monitors returned to Haiti at the weekend in their first
mission since their expulsion by the former military government in July.
Thirteen observers and four administrative staff from the joint United
Nations and Organisation of American States mission arrived from
neighbouring Dominican Republic, the first contingent of a mission expected
to rise to around 300 monitors.
Haiti's greatly weakened army has said it will search the homes of people
suspected of having illegal arms beginning next week and warned suspects to
turn in their firearms or face arrest.
