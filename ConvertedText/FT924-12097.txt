FT  22 OCT 92 / DTI proceeds against former PPI directors


   By DAVID BARCHARD


THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has launched proceedings to have six of
the former directors of Polly Peck International disqualified from becoming
company directors again.
Those named in the DTI application are believed to include both former
non-executive and executive directors in the company. However, Mr Asil
Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, is not included in the
disqualification action.
The DTI apparently takes the view that he is already disqualified from
holding a company directorship because he is an undischarged bankrupt.
The DTI's application is due to be heard in the companies court today.
Polly Peck, a fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate with subsidiaries
across the world, was one of the stars of the London Stock Exchange for most
of the 1980s but collapsed with debts of Pounds 1.3bn in October 1990.
Although most of Polly Peck's main assets have been sold by the group's
administrators, creditors have been warned that they might eventually
receive as little as 11p in the pound.
Administrators are still seeking to gain access to assets held in companies
in the north of Cyprus.
The most recent sale was announced in August, when a Mexican investor group
agreed to pay Dollars 499m (Pounds 306m) for PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce,
the fresh fruit business. The agreement represented the administrators' last
hope to secure a large amount of cash to pay Polly Peck's 23,000 creditors.
