FT  27 OCT 92 / International Company News: American Express tumbles into
Dollars 205m loss


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


AMERICAN EXPRESS last night revealed a Dollars 205m third-quarter net loss
after a heavy Dollars 342m after-tax restructuring charge related to 4,800
planned redundancies and other measures in its core travel related services
(TRS) division.
The group's deficit, the biggest in a quarterly period since the disastrous
losses suffered by its Shearson Lehman investment banking and securities
subsidiary in early 1990, underscored what Standard and Poor's, the rating
agency, yesterday termed a negative outlook for the company.
Although it affirmed debt ratings last night, S&P noted American Express's
problems with credit quality and competition in the card market.
The American Express loss, which compares with a Dollars 31m net profit a
year ago, was caused by red ink in three of its most important divisions.
The TRS division loss was Dollars 187.5m, although operating earnings were
Dollars 155m before the restructuring charge.
The American Express Bank loss was Dollars 29.8m, caused by staff reductions
and by a large jump in bad debt provisions for property loans in the UK -
from Dollars 8m a year ago to Dollars 67m.
American Express's share of Shearson Lehman's loss was Dollars 37.4m. The
investment bank and brokerage house said its quarterly loss was Dollars 25m,
compared with net profits of Dollars 63m a year ago.
The reduction of the TRS workforce by 4,800 people represents 9 per cent of
the division's 53,000 employees.
Other costs were attributed to reorganised product groupings and the need to
cut expenses.
Loss per share in the third quarter was 45 cents, against net earnings of 5
cents a year ago. The losses slashed American Express's net earnings for the
first nine months to Dollars 380m, compared to Dollars 551m in the same
period of last year.
