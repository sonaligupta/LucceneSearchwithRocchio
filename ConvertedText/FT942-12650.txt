FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisition for Northumbrian Foods


   By REG VAUGHAN


Northumbrian Fine Foods, the USM-quoted food manufacturer, is taking a
further step in its expansion plan with the acquisition of Jesse Oldfield, a
Manchester-based cake manufacturer, for a maximum Pounds 2.56m.
An initial Pounds 1.26m will be paid via 11.68m ordinary shares, of which
6.68m have been conditionally placed on behalf of the vendors at 10p each,
subject to a 1-for-7.146 clawback under an open offer to shareholders.
In addition, 2m shares have been conditionally placed to raise about Pounds
200,000 for the company, which will meet the expenses of the acquisition,
the placing and the open offer.
Shareholders will be able to acquire these on a 1-for-23.632 basis.
A further consideration may be payable, of up to Pounds 1.3m, in unsecured
loan notes and is dependent on Oldfield's results for the year to December
31 1994.
The vendors have undertaken not to dispose of the retained 5m shares until
12 months after completion of the acquisition.
Oldfield was acquired by its present management in a buy-out from Mount
Charlotte Investments. It makes slab cake and Christmas cakes with about 60
per cent of sales effected through multiple retailers.
For 1993 its pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 45,000 to Pounds 235,000,
after a Pounds 100,000 bad debt provision, on turnover of Pounds 8.4m,
against Pounds 8.74m.
Mr Henry Roberts, chief executive, said that although operating in a
difficult and competitive market, NFF was maintaining its sales at
acceptable margins.
He said that the acquisition of Oldfield would prove a 'big enhancement' to
full-year profits. He expected group sales for 1994-95 to be in the Pounds
24m to Pounds 25m range.
Mr Roberts said that Oldfield had strong lines for Christmas, a season in
which NFF sales have traditionally been weak.
The acquisition provides opportunities for the enlarged group to increase
sales to a broad range of leading food retailing customers.
