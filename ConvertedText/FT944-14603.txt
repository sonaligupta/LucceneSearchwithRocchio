FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): An ally
against inflation - Investing for income / But be prepared for some ups and
downs


   By DAMIAN REECE


Anyone who wants to enjoy an income from their investment portfolio needs to
recognise the threat of an old and persistent enemy - inflation.
Unit trusts can play a big role in seeing off this threat, by providing
income and capital gains that keep pace with inflation, thanks to the
convenient and low-risk exposure they offer to the world's stock markets.
But with these advantages come risks. There are no guarantees with unit
trusts. Income payments may fluctuate, and your initial capital investment
is exposed to the sometimes alarming ups and downs of stock-market values.
You may end up losing money, especially over short periods.
Stephen Lansdown, a director of independent financial adviser Hargreaves
Lansdown, says: 'The value of unit trusts will go down as well as up, so
investors must be prepared to ride the peaks and troughs of the markets. No
equity investment should ever be made without five-year view in mind.'
Even so, for investors who want to boost their incomings with investment
revenues and protect their capital, unit trusts can play a useful role.
Thanks to personal equity plans, unit trusts can also pay out their income
and capital gains free of tax on annual investments of up to Pounds 6,000
per person.
But investors should not rely solely on returns from unit trusts when
investing for income. The funds should be combined with building society
deposits and gilts, in a balanced income portfolio.
The income record of a number of unit trusts is impressive. Take the most
popular type of income unit trust, those investing in UK equities. A number
of the UK equity income funds monitored by the independent research service
Income Fund Analysis, over the past 10 years, have managed to deliver a good
record of rising income and capital growth.
The table shows the income yield that was available at the beginning of this
year from an investment made in the funds on January 1, 1984. For example, a
Pounds 10,000 investment in the N&P UK Income fund, on 1 January 1984, would
have produced an annual income equivalent to 15.46 per cent to the
basic-rate taxpayer, or 19.33 per cent to a non-taxpayer as at 9 January
1994. And the original Pounds 10,000 had more than tripled in value even
after all the income had been taken.
Compare this with a Pounds 10,000 building society investment made 10 years
ago. The income paid out during 1993 in the form of interest on the initial
Pounds 10,000 investment would be worth about 5.08 per cent to a basic-rate
taxpayer, or 6.7 per cent to a non-taxpayer. Assuming that all the interest
is taken as income, then the initial investment will still be worth just
Pounds 10,000; but in real terms, after inflation is taken into account, it
will have diminished in value.
Although impressive, the unit trust figures mask the fact that income
payments from equity-based investments may not rise steadily year after
year. This is a drawback for investors who want a consistent, regular
income, especially in retirement. Income Fund Analysis has identified just
three unit trusts that have increased their income pay-outs every year since
1981, when it began its study. These are: Prolific High Income, Barclays
Unicorn Income and Kleinwort Benson High Yield.
Over the past five years, the picture is a little better with 16 funds out
of 126 enjoying an unbroken run of increased payouts.
Realistically, investors should expect to see some fluctuations in the
income payments from their unit trust holdings. This is why building society
deposits and gilts - perhaps index-linked to the rate of inflation - cannot
be ignored as part of a portfolio.
The level of income paid by income unit trusts varies considerably. Some
equity income funds pay low initial yields but pride themselves on steady
dividend increases, such as the Prolific fund.
Others pay out yields much higher than the overall stock market average.
These high-yield funds seek out anomalies in individual share prices which
manifest themselves in above-average yields. If a fund manager's ability to
pick such stocks is good, he should profit handsomely when the rest of the
market recognises the anomaly and buys the shares too, thus forcing the
price up. But this is a specialist and risky business, and returns can prove
volatile.
Other high-yield income unit trusts tend to mix equities with fixed-interest
bonds, or simply invest solely in bonds. While bonds will provide relatively
high income at the outset, they cannot increase their pay-outs, which are
fixed. In the past, bonds have also underperformed shares in terms of
capital growth in the long term.
Stephen Lansdown warns investors to check the make-up of a unit trust's
portfolio before investing, to ensure it reflects their investment
objectives.
A recent development has seen unit trust companies branching out into the
controversial and volatile derivatives markets, to engineer new income funds
which try to mimic high-income building society accounts or bond issues,
while maintaining and even growing capital.
Such funds are run by famous City names such as Morgan Grenfell and Foreign
& Colonial. They are suitable only for people with an urgent need for a high
income (9 or 10 per cent a year) and who are willing to take some risks with
capital.
Income payments from unit trusts have been given a recent boost by a
relaxation in the regulations which now allow a trust's charges to be
deducted from capital rather than income. This allows yields to rise 1.5 per
cent straight away, although capital growth will be held back as a result.
