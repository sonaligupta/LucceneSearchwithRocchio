FT  30 OCT 93 / Police chiefs back diluted reforms


THE ASSOCIATION of Chief Police Officers yesterday welcomed the home
secretary's ditching of controversial proposed reforms of police pay and
conditions.
Mr John Smith, association president, welcomed Mr Michael Howard's decision
to reject recommendations in the Sheehy report that junior ranks be employed
on fixed-term contracts, starting salaries cut and pension qualifications
changed. Mr Howard also intends to water down the suggested formula for
performance-related pay.
Mr Smith said: 'The home secretary has listened to arguments that we and
others presented. There's much more yet to discuss and to debate . . . We
will be wanting to continue to argue, but we believe with what the home
secretary said yesterday he's taken (the) police service and therefore the
public back from the precipice.'
Mr Richard Coyles, Police Federation chairman, agreed that there was much
still to be debated, with pay rates an important example. He said discussion
of the rates was back where it belonged, in the police negotiating body.
