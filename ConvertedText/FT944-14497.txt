FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Workers will own Digital unit


   By ALAN CANE


The German subsidiary of Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer
maker, is establishing an independent, employee-owned company to provide
continued employment for about 1,500 staff. The unit is being forced to sack
them as part of its restructuring measures.
The new company, Mitarbeitergesellschaft (Employee-owned Company) or MAG
will be set up in Munich. Employees transferring to the new company will
have their length of service recognised by the new company in addition to
their salaries, fringe benefits and retirement schemes.
Mr Klaus Lutz, personnel director for Digital Deutschland, and Mr Dieter
Jung, chairman of the company's works council said the initiative was: 'An
innovative way of securing employment'.
The plan was approved yesterday by Digital Deutschland, the German trade
unions and the local works council.
MAG's initial business will come from Digital Deutschland. It will be free
to market products and services in areas of the computer business where
Digital no longer intends to operate. It will be free to open up new markets
on its own initiative. The only constraint will be that the company should
not compete directly with Digital.
