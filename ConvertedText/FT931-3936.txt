FT  12 MAR 93 / International Company News: Canadian steel makers in
mini-mill plan


   By BERNARD SIMON


TWO CANADIAN steel producers are joining forces to build a 2m tons-per-year
mini-mill in the US.
Dofasco, Canada's biggest integrated steelmaker, and Co-Steel, which
specialises in mini-mill production, said the first phase of the project,
with a production of 1m tons of flat-rolled hot band a year, would come on
stream in early 1995 at a cost of USDollars 300m. The second phase is
expected to begin in 1997 at 'relatively modest additional capital cost'.
The location of the mill has not been decided, but the choice has narrowed
to sites in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The companies said the
selection would be influenced by electric power costs and infrastructure
requirements.
Mr John Mayberry, Dofasco chief executive, said the new mill would compete
with the world's lowest cost producers. It will also give the Canadian
companies a presence in the US, insulating them from the protectionist
pressures which are periodically exerted on foreign-based suppliers.
