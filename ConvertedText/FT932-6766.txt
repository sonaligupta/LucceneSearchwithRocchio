FT  27 MAY 93 / Builders still await upturn


   By ANDREW TAYLOR


MUCH of Britain's cons-truction industry remains in recession despite the
recent revival in housebuilding, according to separate statistics published
yesterday by the Department of the Environment and Blue Circle, the
country's biggest cement producer, Andrew Taylor writes.
Orders received by contractors were 2 per cent higher during the first three
months of this year than in the same quarter of 1992, the department said.
Construction orders were 22 per cent higher than during the final three
months of last year. Orders for private housing rose 7 per cent on the first
three months of last year. Public housing and housing association orders
were 26 per cent higher.
Sales figures announced yesterday by Blue Circle showed a 6 per cent fall in
volume during the first four months of this year compared with the
corresponding period last year, but the company said demand had stabilised.
