FT  20 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE


ANTICIPATION of an impending cut in German interest rates provided the main
point of interest in an otherwise featureless and quiet day's trading in the
derivatives market, writes Christopher Price.
The December FT-SE contract opened at 2,729 and proceeded to move forward,
although buyer interest was limited causing it to drift back. December
reached its low point of the day of 2,714 around 11am.
However, talk of an imminent German rate cut, which many in the market
believe may happen in the next month, sent December forward. It was also
helped by firmer short sterling and gilts, before settling to trade in a
range of 2,720-30 into the early afternoon.
An indifferent Wall Street, a weaker pound against the D-Mark and a lack of
buyers combined to prompt December to drift slightly in later trading. It
closed at 2,726, down 4 on the previous close and at a 10-point premium to
its estimated fair value of nine.
Wall Street volume was a tawdry 6,058 contracts.
In a busier traded options market, British Steel provided the main focus
among the stocks, recording 2,933 contracts.
This included a seller of 1,000 contracts of the January 50 calls.
Rolls-Royce clocked up 1,606, followed by Marks and Spencer at 1,023 and
HSBC on 982 contracts.
