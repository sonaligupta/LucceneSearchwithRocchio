Shares recouped morning losses caused by technical selling linked to the
March futures and options settlements and the Nikkei average closed
marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index closed up 24.60 to 20,115.31, or 0.7 per cent higher on
the week, after fluctuating between 20,256.23 and a low of 20,017.10. The
index also met selling by investment trusts in response to the yen's rise
against the dollar, but gained ground in the afternoon thanks to foreigner
buying.
Volume swelled on transactions linked to the futures and options
settlements, totaling 750m shares against 426m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks rose 3.39 to 1,619.90, while the Nikkei 300 added 0.15 to

unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index rose 24.60 to 20,115.31.
Foreign investors supported blue chip shares while some individuals dabbled
in speculative favourites. Hitachi rose Y3 to Y930, Toshiba gained Y10 to
Y780 while Sanyo Electric rose Y13 to Y497.
Aids related issues were higher on reports that Japan Energy, a mining
development and petroleum refining company, will launch clinical tests in
the US for an anti-Aids treatment it has developed. The issue jumped Y18 to
Y438 while investors sought other stocks linked to the 'Aids theme' such as
Sankyo, which rose Y50 to Y2,530 and Tsumura which advanced Y60 to Y1,760.
Mining stocks were bought as gold prices rose. Sumitomo Metal Mining added
Y29 to Y920.
Profit-taking depressed Nitsuko, a telecom parts maker, Y30 to Y1,620 while
NEC declined Y10 to Y1,030 and Fujitsu lost Y10 to Y1,020.
