FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: View polarises nuclear review


   From Prof I FELLS and Prof N J D LUCAS


Sir, It is a pity that Dieter Helm (Letters, November 4) seeks to polarise
the nuclear review at its outset by branding us 'pro-nuclear' merely because
we mention some of the advantages of nuclear power. He goes on to place
himself firmly in the camp of the market-led 'dash for gas'.
We suspect that readers of the FT will understand the advantages of a
balanced energy supply portfolio in preference to a precarious dependence on
gas-fired stations selected on a single, simplistic, short-term criterion.
