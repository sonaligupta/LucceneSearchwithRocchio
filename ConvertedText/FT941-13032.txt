FT  27 JAN 94 / Hanson lifts Beazer profits veil


   By MAGGIE URRY


Hanson yesterday removed one of the veils covering Beazer Homes, its UK
housebuilding subsidiary, which it aims to float by the end of March.
It revealed that the builder, which is the fourth-largest in the UK, made an
operating profit of Pounds 37.5m in the year to September 30 on sales of
Pounds 276m.
The information came as Hanson held its annual meeting in London. Lord
Hanson told shareholders: 'The industrial sun is beginning to rise both in
the UK and the US.' He said conditions in the UK building industry were much
improved. Hanson shares rose  1/2 p to 279p.
Before the annual meeting, the management of Beazer Homes, led by Mr Dennis
Webb, managing director, made a presentation to analysts who cover the
housebuilding sector. However, after the meeting some analysts said they had
been given little information and could not put a specific value on the
business until the prospectus was issued. The market value is expected to be
between Pounds 400m-Pounds 450m.
Beazer Homes was bought by Hanson as part of its Pounds 391m purchase of
Beazer in December 1991, when it also took on Beazer's debts of around
Pounds 1.25bn. Before the bid, Beazer had planned to float its UK and
European activities, which also included property and contracting, for up to
Pounds 500m.
Hanson is also floating a 70 per cent stake in its US housebuilding
operation, and the two deals will help reduce the group's gearing, which was
86 per cent at the September year-end.
Beazer Homes said that at the end of 1993 it had a land bank of 16,117
plots, equivalent to 3.4 years at its current rate of building. However, Mr
Webb said later that reservations were currently strong and it was
responding to this demand.
Mr Webb said the balance sheet was 'good' but refused to elaborate on the
level of debt Beazer Homes would have on flotation.
The Pounds 37.5m profit figure for 1992-93 compared with Pounds 37.6m in the
year to June 30 1992, before a Pounds 99.3m write down of assets following
Hanson's acquisition of Beazer, on turnover of Pounds 251.2m. In the year to
June 30 1991 operating profit was Pounds 47.8m on sales of Pounds 313m, with
sales of 5,006 houses.
Beazer sold 4,805 houses in the UK in the 1992-93 financial year, including
850 sold to housing associations. These sales depressed the average selling
price to Pounds 59,000 down from Pounds 63,000 in 1991 and Pounds 60,000 in
1992.
At the 1993 year-end Beazer had 249 second-hand homes in the UK, taken in
part exchange, worth about Pounds 11.5m. Since then Beazer has bought Walker
Group, a Scottish housebuilder, for Pounds 28.2m, adding 1,300 building
plots to its land bank.
Lazard Brothers is sponsoring the issue, and James Capel is broker.
