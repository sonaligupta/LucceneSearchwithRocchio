FT  22 DEC 92 / Jobs go in defence research


THE GOVERNMENT'S Defence Research Agency confirmed yesterday that it was
cutting 2,000 jobs, mainly in the south of England, saving Pounds 90m a year
from its Pounds 800m budget.
Consultations with local authorities, trade unions and MPs resulted in a
reprieve for 25 jobs in Christchurch, Dorset.
Eighteen sites out of a total of 54 will close over the next five years.
About 1,500 scientists will be transferred from those sites, with investment
increased at another 12 sites to provide equipment for them.
