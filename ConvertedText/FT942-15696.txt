FT  14 APR 94 / Eastleigh by-election poised for date in June


   By ROLAND RUDD


The Eastleigh by-election is almost certain to be held on June 9, the day of
the European elections, after the government failed to move the writ
yesterday.
By ensuring that it will not be held on the day of the council elections on
May 5, the government has prevented the winner - expected to be the Liberal
Democrats - from receiving a boost in advance of the European elections.
But the Tories have also raised the political stakes in June since the date
of the Eastleigh by-election may now be seen akin to a 'super Thursday',
with three east London by-elections and the European elections on the same
day.
The loss of Eastleigh coupled with a poor peformance in the European
elections could mark the end of Mr John Major's prime ministerial career.
Sir David Steel, the former Liberal leader, said: 'It is a disgrace that
Conservative fear has resulted in a serious delay to the election of a
representative for the people of Eastleigh.'
He accused the government of being afraid of the election because of the
dispute over qualified majority voting in Europe.
Only the Rotherham by-election will take place on May 5, after opposition
business managers yesterday began campaigning for the first poll in a Labour
seat this parliament.
The vacancy was caused by the death in January of Mr Jimmy Boyce.
