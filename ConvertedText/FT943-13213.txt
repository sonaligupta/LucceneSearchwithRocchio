FT  21 JUL 94 / Observer: Asian high noon


With one previous winner in jail and another having resigned from a senior
sporting post amid allegations of cheating, the Asian of the Year award has
something of a chequered past.
Tonight, at London's Grosvenor Hotel, the 1994 plaudit is likely to go to
Ghulam Kanderboy Noon, owner of Noon Products, which has successfully
cornered a niche in Indian frozen foods, numbering Sainsbury among its
customers. The gong is presented by the UK publication, Asian Who's Who
International, to high-achievers in the diaspora.
Previous winners have been Nazmu Virani - now spending 30 months inside one
of Her Majesty's less salubrious hostelries for his role in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International fraud - and Imran Khan, former Pakistan
test cricket captain.
Khan recently resigned from the International Cricket Council, after
admitting once using a bottle-top to tamper with a cricket ball.
Perhaps the organisers are feeling the need to polish up the award's image.
That could explain the presence of some big noises, including Michael
Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, as chief guest. He's joined by
Labour's Margaret Beckett and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown.
Associates of Noon describe him as 'squeaky clean'; so maybe the choice is
right for a change.
