FT  15 DEC 94 / Observer: Baby on board


Remember the South African Airways TV commercial which showed a passenger
giving birth prematurely? Apart from an attempt to symbolise the birth of
the new South Africa, delivered with the subtlety of a wildebeest skipping
down the aisle of a 747, the heroic air hostesses bring the young passenger
into the world without a drop of goo staining their impeccably pressed
uniforms.
Now TWA has set the record straight. On-board labour is a far messier
business - judging by an unscheduled arrival on a recent TWA flight from New
York to Orlando.
Fortunately, a doctor and two paramedics on the flight came to the rescue of
the cabin staff. Even so, they still needed a straw to clear fluid from the
baby's lungs and shoe-laces to tie the umbilical cord, according to TWA's
version of events.
However, when it comes to toe-curling sentimentality there is not much
difference between the new South Africa and TWA. The lucky parents honoured
the airport where TWA made an unscheduled landing by naming their child
Dulles. Pass the sick bag, please.
