FT  30 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Franchise pact signed for Texan railway


   By ANDREW BAXTER


A Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) high-speed rail network in Texas has come a
step closer after the signing of a 50-year franchise agreement authorising
the construction and operation of the proposed 622-mile network.
The network would be the first high-speed rail system in the US, and would
link Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin with trains running
at more than 200mph. Earlier this week the Texas High-Speed Rail Authority
authorised a corporation recently established by the Texas TGV Consortium to
plan, finance, construct, lease, operate and maintain the system.
It is still not certain, however, that the privately-financed project will
go ahead. Contracts are not expected to be awarded until 1994, and the first
phase of the the system would not be open until 1998.
