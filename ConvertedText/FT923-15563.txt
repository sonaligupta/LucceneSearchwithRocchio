FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Corporate heart


It's nice to know that Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee on corporate
governance is not going to be the last word on the subject. BTR chairman Sir
Owen Green has already complained that Cadbury's report was long on
accountability and short on encouraging efficiency. Now comes another
challenge, this time from the lateral thinkers at the Royal Society for the
encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce.
The Society, whose past initiatives include the Great Exhibition of 1851, is
running a two-year inquiry which started last year and goes under the title
of Tomorrow's Company. Unlike Cadbury, who accepted the existing framework
of accountability with reservations, the Royal Society's enquiry asks
dangerously fundamental questions. What are companies for? Who do they exist
to serve? What responsibilities do they have to groups other than
shareholders?
Like Sir Owen, the man in charge of the programme, Mark Goyder, thinks that
the present system lays too much emphasis on the investor. The most valuable
input in most of today's more important products is not materials, says
Goyder, but knowledge; yet we scarcely know how to measure it.
