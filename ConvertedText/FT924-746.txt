FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: PT Astra chairman to quit


   By REUTER


   JAKARTA


PT Astra International's chairman, who has been blocking the company's
takeover by a group of leading Indonesian businessmen, will resign today,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
The Soerydjaya family has been forced to sell its controlling stake in
Astra, Indonesia's second largest private company, to bail out another
family-owned company, the Summa Group, which has run up losses estimated at
more than Dollars 600m.
Analysts said Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusumo had become a stumbling block to
bids for Astra by two consortia. One is led by timber tycoon Mr Prayogo
Pangestu and the other by Mr Sumitro's son, Mr Hasjim Djojohadikusumo.
Mr Sumitro said earlier he preferred pension funds to buy the shares.
He said Toyota Motor, the Japanese car maker which owns 51 per cent of
Astra's main company, PT Toyota Astra Motors, was worried by the sale of
108m shares or 44.5 per cent of Astra to Mr Prayogo.
His consortium includes Mr Liem Sioe Liong, whose PT Indomobil Utama
assembles Suzuki Motor vehicles and competes with Astra.
