FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: IRI gains breathing space with
tax-credit windfall of L2,000bn

IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company which has total group debts of
about L73,000bn (Dollars 45.68bn), is set to receive around L2,000bn in
unpaid tax credits.
The funds, part of a L3,500bn package of tax credits being reimbursed to
various companies, should give the group a breathing space pending further
restructuring and asset sales.
The IRI group lost L4,809bn after tax last year. Losses at many operations -
notably Ilva (steel) and Iritecna (construction and general contracting) -
have continued to rise, while expected privatisation receipts have so far
fallen behind schedule. As a result, the group expects to lose about
L5,200bn in 1993.
Details of which companies would receive the tax credits were due to be
announced last night following cabinet approval this week for a decree
authorising repayment.
The L3,500bn represents the second tranche of L7,500bn in tax credits
authorised to be paid last March. About L4,000bn of the total has already
been allocated.
IRI has already raised about L1,000bn this year by selling the dividends and
tax credits on shares in some of its profitable subsidiaries over the next
three years. Further funds are due from the sale of the Italgel and Cirio,
Bertolli, De Rica subsidiaries of its SME foods unit.
However, the timing on the SME disposals has already slipped substantially,
and may fall further behind the original schedule.
A court in Naples, SME's legal base, has still to approve the outcome of a
special shareholders' meeting last month which authorised splitting the
company - a vital step to privatisation.
The delay means the deadline for final offers for the two subsidiaries on
sale, which has already been postponed to July 26, may have to be put back
further.
Finanziaria Ernesto Breda, the holding company controlling the defence
activities of the state-owned Efim group, now in voluntary liquidation,
yesterday revised its 1992 loss to L589.3bn from L539.3bn, barely a month
after approving the original figure.
The revision follows new information, which only came to the attention of
FEB's board this week, about possible difficulties recovering funds due from
the L255bn sales in 1991 of stakes in two defence subsidiaries.
