FT  12 APR 94 / Mexican murder inquiry set back

The investigation into last month's assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party, has received a setback after a judge freed an official
accused of helping plot the murder.
The judge on Sunday released Mr Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a PRI official who
hired the security guards accused of aiding the assassin, on the grounds of
insufficient evidence. Mr Rivapalacio had been charged with indirect
involvement in the murder.
His arrest had led to speculation that an organised faction in the PRI was
behind the murder of Mr Colosio, and his release seems to put back hopes
that the government prosecutor will discover who, if anyone, ordered the
assassination.
The judge ruled that there was sufficient evidence to bring to trial Mr
Mario Aburto, the confessed assassin, along with three security guards at
the campaign rally in Tijuana where Mr Colosio was killed - Mr Vicente
Mayoral and his son Rodolfo, and Mr Tranquilino Sanchez.
The three security guards were held on the basis of a video and photographs
that appear to show them helping Mr Aburto gain access to Mr Colosio.
However, Mr Aburto has said he acted alone.
Mr Rivapalacio, an official in a Tijuana branch of the PRI and a former
policeman, was not implicated by the video evidence, making it hard for the
government to sustain its case against him.
The government prosecutor has not released any evidence beyond the video and
photographs. While suggestive, the photographic evidence appears to be
insufficient to prove the guilt of the accused guards.
