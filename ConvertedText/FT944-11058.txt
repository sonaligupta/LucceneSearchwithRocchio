FT  08 NOV 94 / Observer: Infestations


The US State Department's new Bureau of International Narcotics and crime
has, predictably, been christened the bureau of drugs and thugs.
State Department officials say opposition from Congress means the bureau has
not, as originally suggested, taken on another responsibility - dealing with
international terrorism. The idea of a bureau of drugs, thugs and bugs was
too much, obviously.
