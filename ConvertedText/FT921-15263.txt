FT  11 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Oliver shares fall on Pounds 12m loss
warning


Shares in Oliver Group, the footwear and leather goods retailer, plunged 17p
to 68p yesterday after the company warned of losses totalling Pounds 12m in
1991 and said that no final dividend would be paid.
The deficit compares with Pounds 2.68m profits in 1990, which had turned
into larger than expected losses of Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 1.37m) at the
halfway stage last June. The interim dividend however, was in effect
unchanged at 0.71p after adjusting for a scrip issue and last year's total
payment was equivalent to 3.88p.
Yesterday's forecast losses included a Pounds 0.5m deficit on the sale of
properties and exceptional charges of Pounds 5.5m from the writedown of
certain fixed assets and other rationalisation and reorganisation costs.
