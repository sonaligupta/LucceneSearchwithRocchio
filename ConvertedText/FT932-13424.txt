FT  23 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Damaged goods sent packing


   By DELLA BRADSHAW


'Damaged in transit' is an all too frequent expression, but for many small
valuable items, such as china or electronic components, it could soon become
redundant.
Rapida Pak, of Bedford, has developed a packaging system that suspends
delicate items in a flexible film inside a sturdy double-walled corrugated
cardboard frame.
A sheet of the bio-degradable film, developed by Wolff Walsrode, in Germany,
is stretched across the two halves of the cardboard frame. When the item is
placed inside and the box closed around it, the film stretches to the shape
of the product, holding it tightly in place. Rapida Pak: 0234 214896.
