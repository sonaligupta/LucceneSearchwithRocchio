FT  13 NOV 92 / Puerto Rico sees gains in Nafta


   By CANUTE JAMES


PUERTO RICAN concerns that the island's export markets in the US could be
endangered by Mexico's participation in the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta) have eased with indications that the island could gain
from the trade pact.
Puerto Rico's exports to the US last year were valued at about Dollars 17bn,
accounting for 85 per cent of all the island's exports. But government
officials and economists had feared that earnings from exports would be
reduced because of direct competition from a more cost-efficient Mexico.
A study commissioned by the island's development bank, however, has
concluded that, if Nafta were to be implemented, Puerto Rico would have a
clear advantage over Mexico in the US and Canadian markets in
pharmaceuticals, electronic components and accessories, professional
instruments, electronic computing and rum distilling.
This conclusion, said the study done by KPMG Peat Marwick of the US, is
based on comparisons of the return on investments in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
'In pharmaceuticals, the estimated rate of return to a Puerto Rican
investment. . . is about 65 per cent, whereas after Nafta the rate of return
to an investment in Mexico making the same product for the US market is
about 32 per cent,' said the study.
It suggested, however, that Puerto Rico will find it hard to compete
successfully with Mexico in other sectors. In the clothing sector, for
example, the rate of return on investments in Mexico will be 50 per cent
with the implementation of Nafta, while the rate in Puerto Rico will be 30
per cent.
There will be similar disadvantages for Puerto Rico's textile, tuna and
leather footwear industries, the report concluded.
