FT  12 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Endangered males give praise . . .


   From Mr SPIRIDONAS DIOLITSIS and Mr ATHANASSIOS KUSSATHANAS


Sir, In this age of diminished expectations, job security is a laughable
relic of a former life. We request, however, that the FT put serious
consideration to offering Mr Michael Thompson-Noel a columnist position
until the unfortunate event of his passing away.
As management students in the somewhat humourless US, we have come to rely
on his witty column every weekend as a source of unquestionable
entertainment value. His latest offering, 'Wimp of the species' (March 5),
was his best to date. As beleaguered males living in the politically
correct/feminazi world that is academia in Boston, we have finally found a
worthy and able spokesman for the endangered male species.
Hardly a day goes by that we do not thank our lucky stars that the FT and Mr
Thompson-Noel are available on this side of the pond.
