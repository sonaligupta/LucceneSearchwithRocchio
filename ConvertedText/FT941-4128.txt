FT  12 MAR 94 / International Company News: Mazda reassesses loss forecast


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO

Mazda, the Japanese carmaker, expects non-consolidated pre-tax losses for
this year to be substantially heavier than forecast.
The company said losses would widen to Y45bn (Dollars 425.3m) from a
previously-estimated Y32bn. It blamed a steeper-than-expected downturn in
the domestic market, and the adverse impact of the yen's appreciation. Sales
are expected to be Y1,770bn rather than the Y1,890bn forecast in November.
Mazda, 24.5 per cent-owned by Ford Motor of the US, has already announced
its intention to pass its dividend.
This is the third time the carmaker has been forced to revise its forecast
for this year. Mazda said that while it had made strenuous efforts to reduce
costs by between 20 and 30 per cent, this had not been sufficient to cover
the weaker sales.
In the domestic market, Mazda saw unit sales fall from 460,200 to 400,000.
While Japanese carmakers have generally suffered amid the domestic economic
slump, Mazda has been one of the hardest hit.
