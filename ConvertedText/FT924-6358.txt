FT  21 NOV 92 / International Company News: Hoechst profits down 19% as
dollar fall cuts turnover


   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES


   FRANKFURT


PRE-TAX profits at Hoechst, the German chemicals group, fell 19 per cent in
the first nine months of this year to DM1.54bn (Dollars 960m), compared with
DM1.9bn in 1991 and DM2.5bn in the previous year.
A 'summer recession' set in at the start of the third quarter, continued
into the autumn and there is still no end in sight, Mr Wolfgang Hilger,
chairman, said yesterday.
The results, following a 45 per cent profits fall at BASF, further
highlighted the impact of international and now domestic economic weakness
on Germany's top companies. But the news was not as bad as expected, and
Hoechst shares closed DM1.40 up at DM241.90.
The company's fortunes were saved from a more dramatic plunge by its strong
pharmaceuticals business, which accounts for about half its earnings and is
less prone to violent cyclical swings.
But Hoechst could not escape the effects of exchange rate changes. The
effective devaluation of the US dollar against the D-Mark was responsible
for most of the DM770m fall in third-quarter turnover, Mr Hilger said.
Group sales, down 7 per cent in the three months to end-September, were 2
per cent lower after nine months at DM11.9bn.
Cost-cutting programmes, including job losses 'in three figures' next year,
are under way. One move, announced yesterday - the merger of Hoechst's PVC
activities with those of Wacker-Chemie - could save DM50m a year.
According to Mr Hilger, prospects have been dimmed by falling demand. Orders
on hand at end-October were 15 per cent lower than a year earlier.
Fourth-quarter results would be 'virtually the same' as in the third
quarter.
