FT  01 NOV 93 / Financing a cure for Japan's sick economy


   By EDWARD BALLS


MR YOH KUROSAWA, president of Industrial Bank of Japan, is unusually willing
to criticise Japan's policymakers. In an interview in yesterday's Observer
newspaper published in London, he attacked the government for failing to
take sufficient measures to boost Japan's ailing economy. He called for a
Y10,000bn to Y15,000bn (Pounds 62bn to Pounds 93bn) income tax cut - the
government is rumoured to be considering a Y5,000bn cut - and a further half
point reduction in the official discount rate.
But Mr Kurosawa's words, like the Japanese economy, are difficult to read.
While the IBJ president's policy prescriptions are bold, they do not step
too far outside the consensus: fiscal policy is still the preferred option
for reviving Japanese growth, both in Tokyo and among Japan-watchers in the
US Treasury. Yet, up to now, Japan's fiscal activism has not had much
success. Three fiscal packages over the past year have consumed Japan's
general government budget surplus, but they have not produced an economic
revival. The OECD forecasts that the Japanese economy will not grow at all
this year, industrial output and retail sales are still registering
year-on-year falls and broad money growth remains sluggish.
A year ago, the focus of policymakers was on the unhealthy state of Japan's
banking sector. Excessive lending to property companies by the banks and
their non-bank subsidiaries in the late 1980s, followed by the collapse of
the stock market and property prices, had left the banks with substantial
non-performing loans. Official government figures said the bad debts of the
leading 21 banks totalled Y12,300bn, slightly less than in the US when bad
debts reached their peak and much less than in the severely indebted
Scandinavia. But Tokyo bankers acknowledged that the truth was much worse:
counting in the debts of non-bank subsidiaries, and adjusting for Japan's
more restrictive bad debt definition, suggested a total three to four times
the official level.
Mr Kurosawa, in conversation a year ago, was deeply troubled by the likely
effect of these bad debts on bank lending. He handed over a copy of a speech
which he had given in the US at Cornell university the previous week. His
speech praised the idea of setting up an agency to purchase these bad debts
and called for public funds to speed its work. There was, it acknowledged,
opposition to the use of public funds. But Japan would not ignore the fact
that public money had been used successfully both in the US Savings and Loan
bail-out and in the UK in the early 1970s.
But, in the intervening week since his speech was delivered, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the then prime minister, had been strongly criticised for
suggesting that public funds should be used. At the interview, Mr Kurosawa
was adamant that the loan buying agency should not receive public funds. Nor
has it. Not surprisingly, the results have been disappointing: between
February and the end of September, it purchased non-performing loans with a
face value of just Y1,050bn. Japan's banks, due to report healthy
half-yearly operating profits at the end of this month, are using these
profits slowly to write off their non-performing loans.
Now the Japanese economy is, in the words last week of Mr Toshihiko Fukui, a
Bank of Japan director, in 'a protracted and deep adjustment phase'. Survey
evidence suggests that, despite falling interest rates, Japan's banks remain
unusually unwilling to lend. Outstanding loans by the 11 top commercial
banks fell 0.5 per cent in the six months to the end of September, the first
half-yearly fall since the survey began 39 years ago.
Of course, the troubled state of many Japanese manufacturers is a second
reason why Japanese credit growth remains so slow. But, even if their demand
for credit revived, Japan's indebted banks are likely to remain unwilling to
lend for some time. Unless, that is, the Bank of Japan provides funds to
speed the liquidation of these bad debts. For, as Mr Kurosawa knows, tax
cuts alone will not do the trick.

      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous
year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is
shown as a percentage of the total labour force.  Figures for the
composite leading indicator are end-period values.
