FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas profits take
off

   NEW YORK


A SHARP increase in jet airliner deliveries and the benefits of cost-cutting
measures helped McDonnell Douglas, the US aerospace group, to post strong
profit gains in the first quarter to March 31.
All three of its aerospace businesses contributed to the improvement in net
income to Dollars 58m, or Dollars 1.50 a share, against Dollars 2m, or 5
cents a share, the previous year. Revenues rose 13 per cent to Dollars
4.32bn from Dollars 3.83bn.
The company, the largest US defence contractor, had earnings from continuing
operations, before income taxes, of Dollars 99m compared with a loss of
Dollars 11m a year ago.
During the first three months of 1991, McDonnell Douglas delivered 31 MD-80
aircraft, six more than in the same period in the previous year, and six of
its first nine new MD-11 aircraft.
Lower expenses and improved performance at McDonnell Douglas's combat
aircraft business helped the unit report income of Dollars 137m in the first
quarter against Dollars 104m a year earlier in spite of a 20 per cent
decline in revenues to Dollars 1.35bn from Dollars 1.68bn.
The lower revenues were attributed to the government's decision to cancel
the A-12 attack aircraft programme after the cost went over budget.
McDonnell Douglas took a Dollars 350m pre-tax provision in the fourth
quarter to cover the Pentagon's decision to scrap the programme.
During the first quarter the company reduced its workforce to 115,482 from
131,097 a year earlier, reflecting the impact of the cancelled A-12
programme and efforts to cut costs.
McDonnell Douglas has been struggling under a stretched balance sheet, a
heavy capital spending programme, sharp reductions in Pentagon spending and
a troubled civil aircraft division.
It recently cut its quarterly dividend from 70.5 cents to 35 cents a share.
McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraft segment had operating earnings of
Dollars 11m compared with a loss of Dollars 84m in 1990.
The company's missiles, space and electronic systems operations had income
of Dollars 40m compared with Dollars 13m a year ago.
