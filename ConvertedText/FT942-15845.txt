FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Redrow forecasts record outcome


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Redrow, the latest of several housebuilders to pursue a stock market
flotation, yesterday forecast it would make record pre-tax profits of Pounds
21m for the year ended June 30.
This would represent a 52 per cent rise on the Pounds 13.8m achieved in the
previous 12 months.
The figures exclude profits and losses on sale of discontinued businesses,
which would reduce the forecast figure for the current year to Pounds 18.9m.
The forecast, included in a pathfinder prospectus published yesterday,
assumes a notional tax charge of only 9 per cent. This follows the
acquisition last year of Costain's former housebuilding operations in
south-east England which included substantial tax losses.
After all deductions the continuing businesses should be left with profits
of Pounds 19.1m, directors stated.
The company, which claims to be the UK's biggest private housebuilder, is
expected to be valued at about Pounds 350m under the flotation plans, which
include a placing and offer for sale of up to 35 per cent of new shares to
be issued.
About Pounds 50m of new shares are likely to be issued while Mr Steve
Morgan, Redrow's founder, is expected to raise a further Pounds 100m by
selling part of his 98 per cent stake.
The directors said they expected about 2,000 homes to have been built by the
end of June. The average price of a Redrow home during the first six months
of the year was Pounds 86,000 at an operating margin of 12.8 per cent.
Redrow owns 6,700 housing plots at an average cost of Pounds 11,400, or 13.3
per cent of the average sale price. Net debt of Pounds 25m compares with
shareholders' funds of Pounds 68m.
Publication of the final prospectus and pricing details is due on April 28.
Applications should be made by noon on May 9 with dealings due to commence
on May 17.
BZW is sponsoring the issue. Brokers are Cazenove.
