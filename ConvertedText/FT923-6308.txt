FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Stad Rotterdam profits creep up
to Fl 42.5m


   By DAVID BROWN


STAD Rotterdam, the medium-sized Dutch insurance group which is heavily
dependent on the domestic market, yesterday reported first-half net profit
up 3.9 per cent to Fl 42.5m (Dollars 26.23m) from Fl 40.9m.
Group income rose 7 per cent to Fl 1.3bn from Fl 1.2bn and earnings per
share stood virtually unchanged at Fl 1.61 against an adjusted Fl 1.60 for
the same period a year earlier.
Stad Rotterdam suffered from more frequent and expensive claims in the
non-life sector, largely from motor-ists.
The group expects an 'adjustment' in premium rates will be necessary during
the second half. Despite difficult conditions, Stad Rotterdam generated
higher business volume and reported a 7.1 per cent advance in premium income
to Fl 447.2m.
Profit in non-life operations fell by 4.2 per cent to Fl 16.6m. The
situation in motor insurance is not expected to improve before next year.
In the life insurance sector, premium income advanced 2.9 per cent to Fl
530.7m, but profit climbed 9.6 per cent to Fl 19.3m.
Income from investments was up 14 per cent to Fl 324.4m, and the group also
reported an upturn in profitable mortgage business. Stad Rotterdam
reiterated its caution that 1992 earnings per share will be unchanged from
the Fl 3.44 of last year.
