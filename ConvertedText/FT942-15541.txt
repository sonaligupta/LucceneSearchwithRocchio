FT  14 APR 94 / International Company News: First credit rating for UK
pension scheme


   By ANTONIA SHARPE


The Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS), the second-largest pension
scheme in the UK, has become the first one outside the US to obtain credit
ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's, the two leading international
ratings agencies.
According to Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which guided ESPS through
the rating process, S&P has assigned an implied triple-A rating to the
senior debt obligations of ESPS while commercial paper (CP) guaranteed by
the scheme has been rated A-1 plus by S&P and P-1 by Moody's.
With assets valued at more than Pounds 13bn (Dollars 19bn), ESPS provides
the principal pension arrangements for the 12 regional electricity companies
in England and Wales, the National Grid Company, National Power, National
Electric and PowerGen as well as two electrical retailers, Hornepower and
Powerhouse.
Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of ESN Pension Management Group, said
the rating would allow the scheme to achieve fine financing terms.
The rating would also provide the scheme with greater access to the
derivatives market and would be a useful marketing tool when pitching for
pension fund management business outside the electricity industry.
Mr Matthews noted that the CP rating enabled the scheme's US investment
property company, Eastern Realty Investment Corporation, to raise Dollars
105m in the US CP market last month at an average interest rate of less than
3 1/2 per cent.
This financing route provided two advantages to the scheme, he said. First,
it was tax-efficient because the scheme did not have tax-exempt status in
the US.
Second, if the scheme had lent the funds to the US subsidiary, it would have
had to give up a return which was much higher than the interest rate which
the US company was paying.
