FT  07 JAN 94 / Customs to act over statistical returns


The government is to clamp down on companies trading within the single
European market that are failing to comply with requirements to file monthly
statistical returns.
Customs and Excise said yesterday it was planning 'firm action' against
companies still refusing to meet their obligations, a year after the systems
were introduced.
Customs can impose fines through local magistrates' courts of up to Pounds
2,500 on companies which do not file monthly Intrastat returns.
The figures provide information for compiling the trade statistics across
the European Union following the abolition of border controls.
