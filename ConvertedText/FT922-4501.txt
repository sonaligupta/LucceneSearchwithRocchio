FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Troubleshooter clear and unequivocal


   From Mr DAVID FILKIN


Sir, The allegation that companies were 'duped' into taking part in BBC 2's
award-winning Troubleshooter series ('Toil and trouble', June 1) could not
be further from the truth. All companies which took part knew exactly what
the programmes were about.
Richard Reisz, executive producer of the series, wrote to your
correspondent, Kate Button, stating that a detailed letter was sent to each
company prior to filming to guard against any possible misunderstanding. The
letter was clear and unequivocal and included the sentence: 'I should like
to confirm that the point of this series is for Sir John Harvey-Jones to
discuss the problems and solutions openly and honestly. It may well be that
some of his suggestions prove unwelcome. He could cover any area and he
could criticise or suggest changes to methods, people and management.'
