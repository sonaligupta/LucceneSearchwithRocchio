FT  15 APR 94 / Gabon set to reschedule sovereign debt

Gabon is due today to become the sixth member of the African 'franc zone' to
reschedule its debt with sovereign creditors in the Paris Club, since the
zone's 14 members devalued their common currency by 50 per cent against the
French franc in January, David Buchan writes from Paris.
Finance Minister Marcel Doupamby Matoka announced the rescheduling as franc
zone members met French ministers in Paris for a generally upbeat review of
the impact on their long-stalled economies of January's devaluation. Eleven
of the franc zone countries have signed adjustment agreements with the
International Monetary Fund which is lending them FFr3.5bn (Pounds 410m)
this year, in addition to FFr8.8bn aid from the World Bank.
