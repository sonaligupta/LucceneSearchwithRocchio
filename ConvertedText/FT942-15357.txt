FT  15 APR 94 / Blue Circle up 76% and reopens UK kiln


   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent


Blue Circle Industries, the UK's biggest cement company, which yesterday
announced a 76 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, has resumed exports to the
US and reopened a kiln in south-east England.
The measures emphasise the improvement in construction demand on both sides
of the Atlantic, although recovery is more advanced in the US.
Pre-tax profits last year rose from Pounds 93.8m to Pounds 165.6m. If
exceptional items, which depressed the 1992 figure, are excluded, operating
profits rose 57 per cent to Pounds 165.6m.
A reduced tax charge of 31.4 per cent, against 56 per cent after large ACT
write-offs, left earnings per share more than three times higher at 14.5p
(4p).
Blue Circle is paying an unchanged final dividend of 7.5p making a
same-again total of 11.25p. The market was encouraged by the figures and the
shares rose from 327p to 334p.
Blue Circle stopped shipping to the US several years ago. Its kiln at
Northfleet in Kent was mothballed last year when UK construction was still
falling sharply.
Since then the company has won several large orders in south-east England,
including the extension of London's Jubilee underground line, requiring the
kiln to be reopened. A decision on whether to keep it permanently open will
be taken this summer.
The company said first-quarter UK cement sales rose 5 per cent. Sales were
likely to rise by 3 or 4 per cent this year, while cement price increases of
4 per cent introduced in March were expected to hold.
UK profits, including the group's heating, bathroom and kitchen products
operations, rose from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 59.1m helped by cost savings.
In the US, profits more than doubled from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 32.6m with
volume sales of cement, readymix concrete and aggregates rising by 7-15 per
cent. The group in February resumed cement imports from Greece into its
deepwater terminal at Norfolk Virginia. Mr Keith Orrell-Jones, managing
director, expected the company to make further progress in the US this year.
Continental European profits rose from Pounds 28.5m to Pounds 33.5m; Asian
profits increased from Pounds 18.4m to Pounds 20.8m; Africa from Pounds
14.6m to Pounds 17.9m; and Chile from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 34.5m. Overall
building material profits rose from Pounds 96.8m to Pounds 137.7m; home
products contributed Pounds 64.4m (Pounds 60.2m).
