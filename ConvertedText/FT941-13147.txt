FT  27 JAN 94 / State of the Union: Tough-talker Clinton slays the
'naysayers' - The president demands results in his domestic crusade


   By JUREK MARTIN


If giving speeches were all there was to government, and if the US
constitution allowed it, Ronald Reagan would have been elected
president-for-life - and so, on Tuesday night's form, might Bill Clinton. In
fact there was quite a lot of the old Republican gunslinger in the first
official State of the Union address by the self-proclaimed 'new kind of
Democrat'.
The call-to-arms for a better America, with or without the assistance of
Congress, and the brandishing of his pen as he threatened to veto any
healthcare legislation that did not provide universal insurance coverage
were borrowed from the Reagan handbook. So too were the acknowledgement of
ordinary (and not so ordinary) people in the public galleries and the artful
seating at either side of Mrs Hillary Clinton of Jack Smith, head of General
Motors, and Lane Kirkland, the trade union leader.
Critics might also complain that the 64-minute speech was too long, yet
short on new proposals, especially on the revived promise to 'end welfare as
we know it'. Foreigners might lament that its external passage was both
perfunctory and predictable and Republicans that the president keeps
stealing their clothes.
But reservations must be placed in context. The State of the Union address
offers all presidents a stage and - for a Democrat, old or new, welcomed by
a Democratic Congress - an audience guaranteed to applaud often and loudly.
And it found Mr Clinton in vintage missionary form on his favourite subject,
domestic reform. The country, he concluded in ringing tones, 'is growing
stronger but it must be stronger still'.
It was tough for the opposition to muster an effective immediate response.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, speaking woodenly from his office
without the benefit of partisan cheering, could only proclaim that there was
no healthcare crisis, and complain about higher taxes.
Potentially far more revealing, though still to be approached with a degree
of cynicism, was the reaction of Congressman Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
firebrand conservative. 'There is a potential, if this speech was sincere,
for a remarkable coalition that could pass a lot of stuff,' especially on
crime and welfare. He added approvingly that Mr Clinton was now talking his
kind of language.
This, indeed, was the political message of the address. Mr Clinton drew his
line in the sand, insisted that an improving economy was no excuse for
delaying more reform and gave the distinct impression that he did not care
from which side of the political aisle he derived support for his crusade.
But he warned, too, that the body politic was ultimately accountable to the
public - 'those who hold our feet to the fire'.
Americans, he said, would not heed the siren songs of the special vested
interests and the 'naysayers who fear we will not be equal to the challenges
of our time and who misread our history, our heritage and even today's
headlines'.
There were micro-political messages, too. The president's promise to bring
in soon substantive proposals to change the welfare system and explicitly to
link this with healthcare reform was a clear nod in the direction of Senator
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who chairs the Senate finance
committee.
The senator, an intellectual, if temperamental, original in this Congress,
has become miffed with the administration. He has declared, like Senator
Dole, that there is no healthcare crisis and threatened to make trouble for
the health proposals if his welfare hobby horse was relegated in priority -
which is precisely what the White House intended at the start of this year.
At least he was satisfied with Mr Clinton's commitment on Tuesday night,
though as the president went on to expound with much greater passion on the
imperative of healthcare reform he can have been left in little doubt where
the Clinton heart lies.
But this, too, had a political need. The momentum for changes in healthcare,
accelerated by the rapturously received presidential address to Congress
last September, has slowed over the last two months. Other issues such as
Nafta, gun control and Mr Clinton's European trip have intruded while the
insurance and medical professions have begun to launch effective propaganda
campaigns. It had become incumbent on Mr Clinton to regain the initiative.
His ecumenical side was also in evidence in the coda to his address on crime
and on the responsibility of individuals to make communities safer.
Much of what he said appeals to conservatives - mandatory sentencing for
violent offenders, more police on the streets, the restoration of family
values - but some, specifically the calls for ever tighter gun control, does
not.
Violent crime is now a perennial political issue. Every president since
Lyndon Johnson has attacked it and Congress loves to debate it, though the
effect of the efforts of both may be questioned, not least because
conservatives and liberals have rarely agreed on the right prescriptions.
But at least the Senate last year passed, by 95 votes to four, an omnibus
crime bill that now awaits action by the House, while both chambers approved
waiting limits for purchasers of handguns. This measure was now the Brady
Law, Mr Clinton said with pride as he clapped Mr James Brady, the former
presidential press secretary, who from his wheelchair in the galleries
proudly waved his walking stick back in return.
There is always a risk of overloading Congress, especially in the run-up to
mid-term elections. It is possible now that fixation with crime will make
harder action on health and welfare reform, both immensely complicated and
controversial, as well as other items on the president's heavy agenda such
as worker retraining, campaign finance reform, more controls on lobbyists
and the creation of an information superhighway.
But, from his Tuesday night pulpit, Mr Clinton was brooking no delay. 'Our
deepest and most profound problems' could not be left to 'petty political
fighting'. If words were all - and he used them very well - he would be home
and dry. But not yesterday, as his doctors ordered him to rest a voice that
barely lasted the 64 minutes.

CLINTON SPEAKS: WARNING AND COAXING CONGRESS
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
VIOLENT CRIME
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Violent crime and the fear it provokes are crippling our society,
  limiting personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us.'
'Every day, the national peace is shattered by crime. . .The problem of
  violence is an American problem. It has no partisan or philosophical
  element. Therefore, I urge you to ..set aside partisan differences
  and pass a strong, smart, tough crime bill.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
HEALTH AND WELFARE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'I want to make this very clear. . .If you send me legislation that
  does not guarantee every American private health insurance that can
  never be taken away, you will force me to take this pen, veto the
  legislation, and we'll come right back here and start all over
  again.'
'I know it will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the
  same time we tackle healthcare. But let me point out, I think it is
  inevitable and imperative.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
THE FEDERAL BUDGET
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'It will cut spending in more than 300 programmes, eliminate 100
  domestic programmes, and reform the way government buys its goods
  and services. This year we must make the hard choices again to live
  within the hard spending ceilings we have set.'
'The budget. . .draws the line against further defence cuts. It fully
  protects the readiness and quality of our forces.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
FOREIGN POLICY
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
'Our support of reform (in Russia and the other former Soviet republics)
  must combine patience, for the enormity of the task, and vigilance,
  for our fundamental interest and values. We will continue to urge
  Russia and the other states to press ahead with economic reforms.'
'As we build a more constructive relationship with China, we must
  continue to insist on clear signs of improvements in that nation's
  human rights record.'
