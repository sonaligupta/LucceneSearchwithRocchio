FT  20 MAY 92 / Boost for Midlands dividends


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent


SHAREHOLDERS of quoted companies in the east Midlands have fared better over
the past year than the companies themselves, according to an analysis
published yesterday by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The analysis covered the published results of 74 companies, and showed that
while, on average, pre-tax profits fell 5.1 per cent and earnings
attributable to shareholders fell 19 per cent, shareholders received a 17
per cent increase in dividends.
KPMG says 11,500 people have lost their jobs in the region in the past year.
Turnover of the companies in the survey totalled more than Pounds 19bn, and
was 2 per cent higher than in 1990-91. 'By taking into account inflation,
sales have actually fallen in real terms', KPMG added.
