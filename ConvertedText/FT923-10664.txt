FT  29 JUL 92 / Bond's paintings sold for Pounds 2.23m: Saleroom


   By ANTONY THORNCROFT


THE reputation of Mr Alan Bond, the Australian entrepreneur, may be in the
doldrums but his art collection remains in demand.
In Sydney yesterday Christie's sold 52 Australian paintings on behalf of the
receivers of his liquidated company Dallhood Investments, and raised
ADollars 5.7m (Pounds 2.23m). All but two of the works found buyers.
Christie's placed low reserves on the paintings that Mr Bond had acquired in
the 1980s, when he formed one of the finest holdings of 19th-century
Australian art. Prices were above estimate in the main, and the total
exceeded Christie's highest forecast.
A view of Sydney harbour in 1866 by Eugene von Guerard sold for ADollars
715,000, a record for the artist, while another artist record was the
ADollars 660,000 that secured 'The Camp' by Sir George Drysdale. 'Feeding
Time' by Frederick McCubbin sold for ADollars 462,000. Most of the works
went to private buyers.
Mr Bond also bought Impressionist paintings. His most spectacular purchase
was Van Gogh's 'Irises', which he acquired for Dollars 53.9m from Sotheby's
in 1987. Sotheby's loaned him half the purchase price, but when he failed to
repay the debt it arranged for the painting to be sold to the Getty Museum.
Bond's other significant Impressionists were sold off long ago.
