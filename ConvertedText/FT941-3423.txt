FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring aids Emess recovery


   By SIMON DAVIES


Emess, the UK's largest lighting company, yesterday announced the reversal
of two years of losses with pre-tax profits of Pounds 4m for 1993, against a
Pounds 10.6m deficit in 1992.
The result was mainly attributable to improved performances from the US and
German subsidiaries, and the impact of an aggressive restructuring
programme.
During 1993, group staffing levels were reduced by 20 per cent to 2,000, as
businesses were streamlined and unprofitable product lines cut. Sales per
employee rose from Pounds 54,000 to Pounds 64,000 in the year.
Turnover was Pounds 131.2m, against Pounds 130.3m from continuing operations
in 1992.
Mr Michael Meyer, chairman, said: 'I am more encouraged by prospects for our
businesses in 1994 than at any time during the past four years'. He added
that trading in the first two months was ahead of budget.'
Operating profit was Pounds 6m (Pounds 1m loss). The UK operations
contributed Pounds 5.9m (Pounds 0.1m) and they have seen a strong start to
the current year.
Brilliant, the German business, had lost Pounds 2m in 1992, but contributed
a marginal profit last year, after staff reorganisation. Also its US
subsidiary returned to the black during 1993. Net debt at the year-end was
up from Pounds 20m to Pounds 26m, because of the repurchase of Pounds 11m of
preference shares. However, average debt for the year was lower, and
interest payments fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 2m.
The company has recommended an unchanged final dividend of 0.1p, despite the
fact that net earnings of Pounds 2.4m were not sufficient to cover
preference dividends of Pounds 3.9m.
Fully diluted earnings per share amounted to 1.5p (7.2p losses). The shares
closed 2 1/2 p higher yesterday at 32p.
