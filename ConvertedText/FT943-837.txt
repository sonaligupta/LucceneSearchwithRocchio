FT  27 SEP 94 / International Company News: Amoy lifts payout as profits
rise 24%

Amoy Properties, the property investment company which joins the Hang Seng
Index as a constituent stock in November, has reported a 24 per cent rise in
net profits to HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for the year to June 30,
from HKDollars 1.2bn the previous year.
The company also proposes an increase in dividend.
The parent company, Hang Lung Development - the property development and
hotel company controlled by the Chan family - saw profits rise 26 per cent
to HKDollars 2bn over the same period, from HKDollars 1.6bn last year.
The results were broadly in line with market expectations, with Hang Lung's
earnings at the lower end of forecasts.
Mr Ronnie Chan, group chairman, said Amoy spent an aggregate HKDollars 4bn
in adding four quality properties to its portfolio in the year under review.
The company also holds a 70 per cent stake in a project led by Hang Lung to
develop a 211,300 sq m commercial and office complex in Shanghai.
Taken on a fully diluted basis, Amoy's earnings per share climbed 20 per
cent to 62.3 cents from 52 cents. Directors are recommending a final
dividend of 27.5 cents, 17 per cent up on the 23.5 cents paid out this time
last year.
Hang Lung has added a total buildable space of around 107,300 sq m to its
land bank in Hong Kong, which Mr Chan says is sufficient for development up
to 1997. The price tag on this additional land was HKDollars 2.1bn.
Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis rose 20 per cent to 153.4 cents
from 128.3 cents and shareholders are to receive a dividend of 43 cents - an
improvement of 18 per cent on the previous year's 36.5 cents payout - as
well as a bonus issue of warrants.
The one-for-10 bonus issue will entitle the holder to subscribe HKDollars 16
for shares from January 1 to October 31, 1997.
The share price closed at HKDollars 14.2 on Friday, before the results were
announced.
