FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: KKR agrees to invest Dollars
300m in TW Holdings

   NEW YORK


KOHLBERG Kravis Roberts (KKR), the New York-based leveraged buy-out
specialist, has agreed to make a Dollars 300m equity investment in TW
Holdings as part of a recapitalisation at the restaurant and food services
group.
If the deal, still subject to some conditions, goes ahead, KKR would end up
with a 47.2 per cent stake in the company, recently described by one analyst
as the fourth-largest US food service operator.
The South Carolina-based company was subject to a leveraged buy-out bid in
the late 1980s. In 1990 and 1991, it made operating profits of Dollars
238.3m and Dollars 224.6m respectively on annual sales of around Dollars
1.4bn. But interest charges on its substantial debts, meant after-tax losses
of Dollars 67.8m in 1990 and Dollars 67.6m in 1991.
Under the proposed recapitalisation, KKR would purchase 100m newly-issued
shares in TW Holdings at Dollars 3 each.
