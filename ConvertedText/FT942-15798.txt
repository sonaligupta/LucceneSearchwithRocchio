FT  13 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: Dax volatility index planned


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


The Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), Germany's futures and options exchange,
plans to publish a volatility index, which will measure implied volatility
in the Dax (German stock) index options market.
The index 'will make the complexities of price calculation in the derivative
markets even more transparent,' according to the exchange.
The new index will show, for example, that DTB market participants expect a
200-point rise or fall in the index within the next four months. Option
prices are based on market participants' estimation of assumed future
volatility.
