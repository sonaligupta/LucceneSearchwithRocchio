FT  12 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities end softer in
active holiday trade

Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged to slightly lower levels yesterday in surprisingly
active trading for a Veterans Day holiday, which closed the country's banks
and shut the bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.12 off at 3,662.43 and the Standard
& Poor's 500 shed 1.06 to 462.66, but the Nasdaq composite was 2.48 higher
at 778.98. NYSE volume came to 287m shares.
Athough equity investors remain concerned about rising interest rates, the
closure of the bond market yesterday allowed them to concentrate on more
positive factors for most of the session. Chief among these was the growing
hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be approved by
congress in next Wednesday's crucial vote.
Until as recently as a few days ago, Nafta's chances of being passed by
legislators looked slim, and stocks were depressed by the prospect that the
new free trade axis between Canada, the US and Mexico would collapse at the
final hurdle.
Following Tuesday's televised debate between Mr Al Gore, the US
vice-president, and leading Nafta critic Mr Ross Perot, the markets now
believe that the pact's chances of success have improved.
In spite of the tentative optimism, equities shifted direction late in the
session amid weakness in bank and insurance stocks. In the final hour of
trading, the Dow slipped into negative territory as an earlier 11-point gain
dissolved.
McDonnell Douglas jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 104 7/8 after the defence
contractor told analysts it had reduced debt and boosted margins. AT&T rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/4 in heavy volume as investors celebrated the
news that the telecommunications group had won a big contract to provide
equipment to Pacific Telesis.
Another Dow stock on the rise was Philip Morris, which put on Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 56 3/4 after analysts at two broking houses, Goldman Sachs and
Salomon Brothers, upgraded their ratings on the stock following recent rises
in cigarette prices.
The Gap climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 , a new 52-week high, on
news of third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, up from 43 cents a year
ago and well above Wall Street forecasts.
Bear Stearns rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 22 3/8 following an article in the
Wall Street Journal highlighting the company's recent strong profits
performance. The stock was additionally helped by a buy recommendation from
Prudential Securities.
Canada
TORONTO extended its winning streak to four sessions as surging precious
metal shares led the way. The TSE 300 index closed 21.7 up at 4,291.3,
another record peak. Rises led falls by 428 to 340 after 79.5m share volume.
