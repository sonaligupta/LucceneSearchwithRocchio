FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Berisford problems 'at last under control'


   By MAGGIE URRY


BERISFORD International, the property and commodities group which nearly
went into receivership in 1990, said yesterday that 'the problems of the
past are at last under control'.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, also said two non-executive directors, Sir John
Egan and Mr Murray Stuart, thought it a suitable moment to retire from the
board. Mr Stuart was the chief executive who carried through a Pounds 1.2bn
refinancing.
Mr Alan Bowkett was appointed chief executive in January when Mr Stuart
resigned his executive job to take up another appointment. Mr Bowkett's job
now, Mr Sclater said, was to identify market sectors with above-average
growth prospects and to develop an industrial strategy which could be
pursued through acquisitions.
The group yesterday reported interim results for the six months to end-March
showing a net loss of Pounds 58m (profit Pounds 178.8m) after extraordinary
costs of Pounds 45.3m (gains Pounds 183.8m). There was a reduction in
shareholders' funds from Pounds 153m at the financial year end in September
to Pounds 95.6m. The shares fell 1p to 15 1/2 p.
A further Pounds 40m provision has been made against Berisford's loan
guarantees to Rayner Coffee International, its 45 per cent-owned coffee
trading associate. A review of RCI's business has persuaded Berisford it is
unlikely to become a strong business capable of attracting buyers.
Berisford has made its continuing support of RCI conditional on RCI making
asset sales to repay debt. Even so Berisford estimates it will have to sell
some of its own assets to meet its obligations under the guarantee to RCI.
The group had net cash of Pounds 3.8m compared with net debt in the
September balance sheet of Pounds 1.5m. However, at the end of March
Berisford was guaranteeing Pounds 49.4m of RCI's debt.
