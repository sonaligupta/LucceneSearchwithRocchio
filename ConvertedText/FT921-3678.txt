FT  13 MAR 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Getting to grips with IT
networks


MANAGING information across a local or wide area network can be the stuff IT
department nightmares are made off.
UK-based Digital Networks International has developed the Help Desk Expert,
a PC network software package which enables all the optional modules to
inter-relate and to update one another.
The software, developed using Clarion, a fourth-generation language,
centralises all IT documentation and associated databases within larger
organisations and then distributes the maintenance of the data to those best
suited to carry it out.
Some 11 add-on modules, ranging from purchase order tracking and training
schedules to PABX planning and even the IT department payroll, have been
added to its basic features.
Digital Networks International: UK, 0342 326 000.
