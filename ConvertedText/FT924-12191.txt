FT  22 OCT 92 / Australia takes steps to protect pensions


   By EMILIA TAGAZA and REUTER


   CANBERRA


THE Australian government yesterday announced measures to protect workers'
savings in pension funds. They follow the introduction in July of a
compulsory national savings scheme that will see pension funds controlling
ADollars 900bn (Pounds 380bn) of Australian savings by the year 2000.
The plan, to be phased in from next July, includes a compulsory levy on all
pension funds to repay members of a fund that goes broke or suffers from
fraud.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said that central to the measures
was the requirement that all funds be incorporated or have the provision of
pensions as their dominant activity.
This would bring all funds within the reach of the strengthened Insurance
and Superannuation Commission, which will have the power to remove trustees
and take representative action on behalf of fund members.
The government is also forcing funds to diversify their investments by
reducing the limit on in-house assets from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
Members are to be allowed greater involvement in their funds' activities.
From July 1995, all funds with five or more members will be required to have
equal employer and employee trustee representation.
The savings scheme introduced in July requires employers to pay 9 per cent
of their payroll into a pension fund, and employees to pay 3 per cent of
their salaries to a fund by the year 2000.
The Australian government has set up a company to market new Australian
technology, most of which has ended up being commercialised overseas in the
past, Reuter reports from Canberra. 'Australia has a well merited reputation
in the research area for clever people creating world class technology,' Mr
Don Bourke, chairman of the government-owned Australian Technology Group,
said yesterday
