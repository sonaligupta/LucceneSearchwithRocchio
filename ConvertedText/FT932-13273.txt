FT  23 APR 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Survey of
Investment Trusts (23): A classic ploy in a bull market - Their worth lies
in a healthy rate of asset growth, but a repeat of their strong 1980s
performance is unlikely / Capital Shares


   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU


CAPITAL SHARES of split investment trusts are traditionally branded as risky
and volatile. Their sudden revival in the year to March follows a period of
weakness which will have done nothing to reverse this image.
The idea behind early split-level trusts was that one class of investor
would receive all the income of the trust, while the others - holders of
capital shares - would reap all the capital growth.
Recent split-capital trusts have a more complicated structure with the
addition of zero dividend preference shares, which have first claim on the
assets of the trust at wind-up.
Capital shares receive the remaining assets of the trust but, unlike zeros,
they do not have a fixed redemption value. Their worth to investors
therefore lies in a healthy rate of asset growth to bring a good return, and
it is for this reason that they are regarded as classic bull-market ploy.
Since most capital shares are geared - a modest rise in a trust's assets can
have a major effect on their value - their strong performance over the past
year is intertwined with the revival of the UK stock market.
They have outperformed other classes of split-trust shares in the year to
March. The average growth of investment trust capital shares was 11.6 per
cent over the period, according to Finstat, but the difference between the
top- and bottom-performing shares underlines that this is an average.
Capital shares of Mezzanine Capital rose 105 per cent during that period,
while those of Exmoor Dual Capital trust dropped by just under 40 per cent.
The recent push by capital shares is reflected in the performance of
Exeter's Capital Growth unit trust, which invests exclusively in investment
trust capital shares. It was top of the UK equity growth sector in the month
to March 1 after languishing near the bottom of the sector in the
three-years to March 1.
Hargreaves Lansdown launched a managed portfolio service of investment trust
capital shares - the Geared Growth Portfolio - in March, on the back of this
recent performance.
'Capital shares are cheap by historical standards, and by buying now while
prices are low, investors have scope for enormous returns,' says Hargreaves
Lansdown, which believes the UK market is entering a new growth cycle which
stands to benefit capital shares above others.
Since capital shares pay no income, the only tax liability is to capital
gains tax, which many people find adequately covered by their capital gains
tax allowance, currently of Pounds 5,800. 'Capital shares are attractive,
because the market does not price in their tax efficiency,' said Nigel
Sidebottom, of stockbrokers Gerrard Vivian Gray.
Most capital shares appear to be on a deep discount to net asset value
(NAV). However, this is an area for caution. The convention is to quote the
discount, compared with the current claims of other classes of share, such
as zeros. But the demands of the zeros rise every year. A more realistic
approach would be to compare the price of the capital shares with the assets
left after the zeros have been repaid at their wind-up price. Shares which
seem to be at a discount by one method, may be on a premium by the other.
As an example, Scottish National appears to be on a discount of about 60 per
cent to current NAV, but is so highly geared that assets would have to grow
by at least 6 per cent per annum in order to pay back its debt on wind up in
1998, according to Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at S G Warburg
Securities. It is, on the more conservative valuation method, trading at a
premium.
'Look at the expected net returns,' says Mr Sidebottom, who favours
Throgmorton Dual capital shares. 'If you buy today at its price of 383p,
when the trust winds up in 1999, you will get the current asset value which
probably represents a return of 7 per cent compound per annum.'
However, Mr Sidebottom believes that even highly geared capital shares can
be attractive if they are cheap enough.
Capital shares had a very good record in the early 1980s bull market - the
average return was 479 per cent over 10 years, compared with 246 per cent on
the FT-All Share, according to Mr Aaron, but this has been during a period
of high inflation which pushes up the market.
If you subscribe to the view that, despite having left the exchange rate
mechanism, we will be in a low-inflation environment for a prolonged period,
the market - and capital shares - are unlikely to reach the same heights of
performance as over the last decade.
