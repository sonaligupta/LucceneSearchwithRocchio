FT  16 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: The old guard marches on -
The mood at Warburg


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and NICHOLAS DENTON


The collapse of talks came just as Warburg employees were beginning to come
to terms with the merger and even, some of them, relish the broader horizons
it would open up.
'Personally I am disappointed. What was being offered here was a brave new
world,' said one employee. He said that the chance of a more dynamic future
outweighed the threat of job cuts, at least for younger staff. But staff say
the company is 'split down the middle'. One spoke of the existence of an old
guard who 'do not have much to gain from this and have much to lose. They
will be able to prolong the status quo,' he said.
Some New York staff and Eurobond traders, the Warburg employees most exposed
to rationalisation, have been given a stay of execution and will also be
relieved.
There is a general recognition nevertheless that the collapse of merger
talks is not the end of the story. Either another buyer, or Warburg itself,
will force job cuts.
When or how has become even more uncertain than it was a week ago,
contributing to the sense of insecurity at Warburg.
'We now have to go through a period where we worry about whether there will
be another bid. We are in limbo,' said one bond specialist.
Bewilderment has sometimes turned to anger. 'We have been led up the garden
path and then shoved back out again,' said one employee.
Faith in management has been seriously shaken. Cynics at Warburg are
betting, not on markets, but on the future of Lord Cairns, the chief
executive, after what one described as 'the bizarre course' of the abortive
merger talks.
