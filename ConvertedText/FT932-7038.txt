FT  26 MAY 93 / Pounds 1m owed to Swan Hunter's suppliers


   By CHRIS TIGHE


SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipyard which recently went into receivership,
owes almost Pounds 1m to direct suppliers in North Tyneside alone, according
to research released yesterday.
A survey by North Tyneside council's economic development service of 40 of
the yard's 44 direct suppliers in the borough says the suppliers employ
1,542 people; businesses representing 70 per cent of these said they faced a
significant impact if Swan closes.
The research, the first attempt to quantify the knock-on effect of Swan's
possible demise, reveals that the yard owes Pounds 904,000 to 31 of the
companies; some of the other nine, which declined to disclose details, are
also believed to be owed substantial sums.
Most said it was too soon to quantify job losses if Swan closed. But one
business, a supplier to Swans since 1937, planned to cut 10 jobs now.
In total, the report says, Swan has 140 direct suppliers in Tyne and Wear
and many local companies supply it.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, was warned yesterday that there is
growing concern at Swan's uncertainty.
Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation,
told Mr Sainsbury in London that a rapid government response on whether work
could continue beyond Friday on outfitting three frigates was vital to
maintain cashflow.
