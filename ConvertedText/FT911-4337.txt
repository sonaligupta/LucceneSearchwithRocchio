FT  19 APR 91 / Halifax mortgage rate cut to 12.95%


   By PHILIP COGGAN


HALIFAX Building Society, Britain's largest mortgage lender, has cut its
mortgage rate from 13.75 per cent to 12.95 per cent following the latest
base rate cut last week. The new rate will apply to existing borrowers from
May 1 and to new borrowers immediately.
The two-thirds of Halifax's 1.8m borrowers on the annual review scheme will
continue to pay 14.5 per cent until next year.
The rate of 12.95 per cent puts Halifax in line with Nationwide Anglia,
which cut its rate last Friday, but above the Woolwich which yesterday
announced a cut of 0.85 percentage points to 12.9 per cent for existing
customers from May 1. All three offer discounts for larger loans, with
Halifax charging 12.15 per cent for loans of Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 99,995
and 11.95 per cent for larger loans. Woolwich charges 12.15 per cent for
loans above Pounds 60,000.
Halifax is also to offer a customer loyalty bonus of 1 percentage point for
borrowers with a good payment record who move house and stay with the
society.
The fall in base rates has been used by societies to widen their lending
margins, which Halifax said had been driven artificially low to protect
borrowers from the full impact of high rates. When the base rate was 15 per
cent, mortgage rates were 15.4 per cent, a spread of 0.4 of a percentage
point. With a base rate of 12 per cent the spread has doubled.
Halifax has cut its savings rates by up to 1 percentage point, although its
tax exempt special savings account (Tessa) rate stays at 14 per cent.
