FT  11 APR 92 / UK Company News: Lilley to withdraw from property joint
ventures


   By ANGUS FOSTER


LILLEY, the Glasgow-based construction and contracting company, is close to
disposing of its share of five property joint ventures in a move which would
signal a significant withdrawal from property development for the company.
Lilley announced yesterday that it expected negotiations on the sales to be
complete by Thursday and it was therefore delaying the announcement of
results for the year to December 31 until the same day.
The joint ventures have been developed in partnership with London &
Edinburgh Trust, the probable purchaser. They include industrial and
commercial property in Scotland and England and account for the bulk of
Lilley's UK property holdings.
The unwinding of the joint ventures was welcomed by one analyst who said
cash raised from the sale would reduce Lilley's gearing, which is estimated
at 30 per cent at year end. The shares gained 0.5p to 28.5p for a gain of
3.5p on the day.
However, there were concerns the book values of some of the properties may
be higher than their disposal value because of recession in UK property.
This may lead to a provision being made as part of the disposal.
Last October, Lilley announced sharply increased losses on property
development of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 1.3m) for the six months to June 30 as
projects were completed but failed to find enough tenants. Two properties
Lilley is preparing to pull out of, one in Chelsea, London and an office
development in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, were partly to blame for the
losses.
