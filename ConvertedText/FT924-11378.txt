FT  26 OCT 92 / Bomb kills five Israeli soldiers

   JERUSALEM


A ROADSIDE bomb detonated by guerrillas killed five Israeli soldiers and
wounded five others in south Lebanon yesterday, the Israeli army said,
Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
It was the worst attack in nearly two years in Israel's self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon.
A spokesman for the Rambam hospital in Haifa said three of the wounded
soldiers were in critical condition with shrapnel wounds. Another was in
moderate condition and the fifth lightly wounded.
An army colonel told Army radio that pro-Iranian Hizbollah (Party of God)
guerrillas had detonated a bomb under a truck in a convoy of seven army
vehicles.
About 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA)
soldiers patrol the 15km-deep zone, set up by Israel in 1985 to stop
guerrilla raids.
