FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 100m interest gloom for Brent Walker


   By DAVID BLACKWELL


Interest payments of more than Pounds 100m overshadowed an improvement in
interim operating profits at Brent Walker, the bookmaking and public house
group laden with Pounds 1.4bn of bank debt.
The group, which is also losing Sir Keith Bright as chairman, warned that
turnover in its core business had shown 'little sign of an upturn, leaving
the results potentially vulnerable to competitor activity and the economic
climate, especially in the short term.'
Operating profits increased from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 35.2m for the six
months to June 30, while turnover edged ahead from Pounds 858.9m to Pounds
867.9m.
But after exceptionals and payment of net interest at Pounds 103.6m (Pounds
98.1m) the loss amounted to Pounds 73.5m, compared with a previous loss of
Pounds 83.3m. The deficit in shareholders' funds widened from Pounds 629.8m
to Pounds 877m.
A Pounds 10m cost incurred by breaking previous finance arrangements at the
William Hill betting chain is believed to be the main reason why the latest
interest payment is higher than for first half 1993. The group will pay only
Pounds 20m of the interest total in cash, with most of the rest converted
into preference shares.
Sir Keith joined the group in January last year in order to oversee the
reorganisation of its finances, including the refinancing last March of a
Pounds 325m loan at William Hill. He feels that he has completed the work he
originally undertook, and now 'wishes to follow other interests.'
He will be replaced by Sir Brian Goswell, already a non-executive director,
and a senior partner in Healey & Baker, estate agents and surveyors.
Operating profits at William Hill, now the main engine of the group,
improved from Pounds 24.2m to Pounds 30.8m on turnover of Pounds 806.8m
(Pounds 791.4m). The group described its retention of market share as
'encouraging' ahead of the National Lottery launch in November.
However, 'the most significant event' was the refinancing that had enabled
the chain to stay within the group. Mr John Leach, finance director, said
yesterday that flotation was an option for William Hill, 'but not
necessarily the only one'.
Brent Walker is claiming Pounds 200m in a dispute with Grand Metropolitan
over the purchase of the chain, which is in the balance sheet at Pounds
697.2m. A valuation of the assets at the end of last year showed it was
worth Pounds 486.1m.
The Pubmaster chain of public houses reported increased operating profits of
Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.14m) on turnover of Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 46.9m).
Operating profits at the 'other businesses division' - which includes the
Cardiff International Arena and Brighton Marina - fell to Pounds 1.77m
(Pounds 2.11m) on turnover of Pounds 15m (Pounds 18.8m).
The loss per share was 20.83p (24.32p). There is no dividend on either
ordinary or preference shares.
