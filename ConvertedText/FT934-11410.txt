FT  01 NOV 93 / People: Finance moves - Gartmore


Kevin Walsh has been appointed head of North American operations at
Gartmore. Of the funds under Gartmore's management, 77 per cent are UK
pension funds, so the company has recognised its need to diversify into
other markets and has finally embarked on a project to attract North
American clients to its fold.
Walsh was previously managing director of SEI International Investment
Group, a US-based consultancy which, among other things, helps pension fund
clients pick fund managers and where he directed its product and marketing
effort. Before that, Walsh was a partner and senior account manager at
Brinson Partners, also a pension fund consultancy.
Banque Indosuez, Gartmore's parent is planning to place 25 per cent of its
shares on the London market.
In other moves, Vivian Bazalgette (above left) has been appointed md, and
Mike Bishop deputy chairman, of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. Peter
Pearson Lund, formerly md, has been appointed chairman of Gartmore Fund
Managers; Lewis McNaught (above right), formerly deputy md, has been
promoted to md. Edwin Doeg and Charles Hoblyn have been made directors.
