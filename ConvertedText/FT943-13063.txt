FT  21 JUL 94 / MPs back wind farms for Wales


   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM


More wind farms should be allowed in Wales, the Commons Welsh affairs
committee said yesterday, Roland Adburgham writes.
The committee's report says: 'Within the framework of a robust, appropriate
and locally accountable planning system we see no objection to the
continuing development of wind farms in Wales, subject to their
environmental acceptability.'
The committee's support comes at a time when there has been increasing
opposition to the turbines on grounds of visual intrusion, noise and lack of
economic justification.
The MPs stress: 'We believe that concerns over visual impact are the most
deep-seated and firmly held objections to the development of wind energy.'
There should be 'the strongest presumption' against turbines in national
parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty.
The report adds: 'Whether wind turbines become accepted will crucially
depend both on the sensitivity with which they are sited and on their being
seen as a genuine contribution to clean, renewable and economically viable
electricity generation, rather than as evidence of the greed of developers
for a generous subsidy.'
The MPs criticise the fact that seven wind farms were built in Wales before
there was a requirement for environmental impact assessments.
