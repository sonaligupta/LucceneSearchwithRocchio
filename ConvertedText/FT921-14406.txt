126m in last quarter

MOTOROLA, the leading US electronics and semiconductor manufacturer,
reported improved fourth-quarter results, buoyed by the performances of its
semiconductor, cellular telephone and paging businesses.
Fourth-quarter income rose to Dollars 126m, or 96 cents a share, from
Dollars 109m, or 82 cents, in the fourth quarter of 1990. Sales for the
quarter rose 4 per cent to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.93bn in the same
period last year.
Fourth-quarter results reflected 'sluggish economies in the US and Europe',
said Mr George Fisher, chairman and chief executive.
'This impact should continue to be felt in the first half of 1992 with the
potential for modest economic growth in the second half.'
Sales for the full year increased 4 per cent to Dollars 11.34bn, from
Dollars 10.88bn in 1990. However, earnings declined to Dollars 454m, or
Dollars 3.44 per share, from Dollars 499m, or Dollars 3.80, in the previous
year.
Motorola said sales of its communications products rose 2 per cent in 1991,
against the previous year, while semiconductor products sales rose 7 per
cent.
However, the company's computer sales fell 2 per cent and the information
products group recorded increased operating losses for the year. The company
also recorded losses due to investments in a proposed global communications
system called Iridium.
Military and government sales fell 8 per cent, in spite of a significant
contract for secure telecommunications equipment from Saudi Arabia. The
automotive and industrial electronics group reported an 8 per cent increase
in sales.
