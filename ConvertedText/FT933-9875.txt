FT  06 AUG 93 / People: Non-executive directors


Colin Fitch, one of the more permanent features in the rough and tumble
world of City corporate finance, is bowing out. He plans to retire as a
corporate finance director at Kleinwort Benson Securities when he reaches 60
at the end of the year and has picked up his first non-executive
directorship by joining the board of Manders, the Wolverhampton-based
paint-maker.
Roger Akers, Manders' chief executive, says that he has known Fitch for
quite a while but got to know him particularly well during last year's
takeover battle. Fitch was a member of the Kleinwort Benson team which
helped Manders defeat the unwelcome Pounds 86m bid from Kalon, a rival
paint-maker.
After working as an assistant secretary at the Stock Exchange, Fitch joined
stockbrokers Rowe and Pitman where he worked closely with the late Bill
Mackworth-Young, one of the big names in the corporate finance field 20
years ago and who later headed Morgan Grenfell. Fitch was head of corporate
finance at Rowe and Pitman between 1968 and 1976 and was heavily involved in
bringing two well-known names to the stock market - Pilkington in 1970 and J
Sainsbury in 1973.
During the oil price boom of the mid-1970s Fitch spent three years as
managing director of Wardley Middle East, the Hong Kong Bank's Dubai
merchant bank, before returning to the City in 1980 to join Grieveson Grant
which was later taken over by Kleinwort.
