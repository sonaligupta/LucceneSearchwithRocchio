FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Floor price


A company that moved into shiny new City premises in June 1991 paid Pounds
31 a square foot, with an 18-month rent-free period.
In expansive mood, it has just taken up extra space for which it's paying
only Pounds 20 a square foot, with 3 1/2 years rent-free.
