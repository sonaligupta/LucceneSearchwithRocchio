FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sapporo to end 11-year link with
US brewer

Sapporo Breweries, the third largest of Japan's four main beer companies,
plans to end its 11-year-old distribution deal with Miller Brewing of the
US.
Sapporo wishes to end its exclusive partnership with Miller, a unit of
Philip Morris, to free itself to distribute a wider range of foreign beers,
the Japanese brewer said.
The present contract restricts Sapporo to selling Miller's and no other
foreign beer, a disadvantage to the Japanese partner at a time when beer
imports to Japan are rising fast. The pair had come to an amicable agreement
to end their partnership within the year, Sapporo said.
Foreign beer sales in Japan multiplied five-fold in the first half,
propelled by the ease with which the yen's strength allows them to undercut
Japanese beer prices. There has been a shift in consumer taste, and decline
in brand loyalty.
Even after their fast growth, beer imports take only a 3 per cent market
share, compared with Sapporo's 18.5 per cent. But the growth in competition
has been enough to trigger a beer price war and oblige brewers to review
their distribution and production arrangements.
