FT  17 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Lilley aims to strengthen UK links with
Mexico


   By ANTHONY MCDERMOTT


MR Peter Lilley, the UK trade and industry secretary, starts a visit to
Mexico on Monday, at the head of a business delegation to take advantage of
what he calls the 'remarkable developments. . . over the last few years with
the freeing of markets through trade and investment liberalisation,
deregulation and privatisation'.
One aim will be to increase UK trade with Mexico, which with exports in 1990
of Pounds 262m and imports of Pounds 172m lags behind the US, other EC
countries and Japan. Mr Lilley also intends to discuss the implications of
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
