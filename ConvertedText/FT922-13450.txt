FT  11 APR 92 / Finance & The Family (At A Glance): Mixed week for small
companies


Small company shares had a rocky week in the lead up to the election result.
The Hoare Govett Small Companies Index (capital gains version) fell 1 per
cent from 1131.74 to 1119.96 in the week to April 9; the County Small
Companies index fell 1.1 per cent from 899.27 to 889.31 over the same
period. The figures do not take account of the rebound in share prices
yesterday.
