FT  23 APR 93 / Figures confirm mildness of Scotland's recession


   By JAMES BUXTON


WHILE it is hard to pinpoint any significant source of new jobs, the figures
for Scotland are confirmation of the mildness of its recession, James Buxton
writes.
Since early last year Scottish unemployment has been lower than the UK
average - something not experienced since the early years of this century.
Scotland has the second-lowest unemployment of any region in the UK.
The recession has produced few large-scale job losses in Scotland. The last
boom was far weaker in Scotland so there was much less fall-out from
speculative expansion. Scotland has also benefitted from the North Sea oil
industry and the bias of its manufacturing towards exports. Most of its
heavy industry has gone.
The figures show slight improvements in the industrial west, but also rises
in jobless totals in the Inverness and Invergordon areas in the north. This
reflects the sharp contraction of the oil platform fabrication industry,
where about 5,000 jobs have been lost in the past year.
