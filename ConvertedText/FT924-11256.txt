FT  27 OCT 92 / Graduate pay rise slowdown reported


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


STARTING salaries for this year's graduates rose by 4.6 per cent compared
with last year - the lowest rise since 1979, a survey says.
The average salary for new graduates in the nine months from November last
year to July this year was Pounds 12,397.
The salary survey, conducted by the Central Services Unit, the graduate
employment service, is based on 895 advertised vacancies in 18 issues of
Current Vacancies, the organisations' fortnightly journal, which goes to all
student careers services.
Average pay for graduates working in the public sector has risen far less
than the overall average, dragged down by salaries in local government,
education and health authorities - where graduates all learn less than
Pounds 11,350.
Engineering graduates registered above average, with salaries of Pounds
13,048, while science graduates were slightly below average at Pounds
12,214. Graduates working in management consultancy enjoy the highest
average salary at Pounds 16,352, while those in recruitment agencies do
worst on Pounds 10,000.
