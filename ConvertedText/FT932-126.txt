FT  30 JUN 93 / Observer: Nuclear waste


Pst. Need a nuclear scientist in a hurry, no questions asked? Finland has
the answer. The University of Helsinki's Research Institute for High Energy
Physics has organised a three-day conference next May to help find new
sources of employment for nuclear scientists from the former Soviet Union.
Factotum, a London conference firm, is organising the event. Sounds like the
sort of bash where one could pick up an out of work rocket scientist on the
cheap.
