FT  24 NOV 92 / Pearson hope for Channel 5


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THAMES Television is hoping to persuade Pearson, the media and industrial
group, to take a 20 per cent stake in Channel 5, the new national television
channel.
The Independent Television Commission has set a deadline of December 4 for
Thames to show that it has raised 70 per cent of the investment needed.
So far only Thorn EMI, the Thames majority shareholder, is prepared to
commit itself to a stake of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent in a venture
likely to cost more than Pounds 100m.
Pearson, which holds stakes in other television ventures, could, under
broadcasting legislation, take a 20 per cent stake in Channel 5.
It is believed that Pearson has been having detailed talks on a potential
stake for the past two or three years. No decision has yet been taken.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is one of two UK companies in talks
with Thames.
One of the obstacles is the cost of retuning millions of video recorders
likely to suffer interference from the Channel 5 signal. But engineers now
believe that by broadcasting the signal in a different mode - horizontal
polarisation - the cost can be reduced.
