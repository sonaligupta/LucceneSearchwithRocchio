FT  22 JUL 93 / International Company News: UTC declines 12% for quarter


   By MARTIN DICKSON


UNITED Technologies, the US high-technology group, reported a 12 per cent
drop in second-quarter net income as sharply lower profits at its Pratt &
Whitney aero-engine business offset improved performances in most other
parts of the group.
Net income was Dollars 130m, or 89 cents a share, compared with Dollars
148m, or Dollars 1.03, for the same period last year. Revenues were Dollars
5.6bn, down from Dollars 5.7bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said operating profits from businesses other
than Pratt grew 19 per cent, compared with last year.
Pratt, which has suffered from the downturn in the airline industry,
reported operating profits of Dollars 6m, down from Dollars 122m a year ago.
Revenues dropped from Dollars 1.8bn to Dollars 1.7bn.
Lower sales of engines and spares were offset by revenues from the
renegotiation of several aircraft leases relating to prior-year engine
deliveries.
Mr Robert Daniell, UTC chairman, said Pratt was showing an improvement from
the first quarter, with an increase in commercial engine parts orders in the
first six months.
UTC's flight division, which includes Sikorsky, the helicopter manufacturer,
produced operating profits of Dollars 96m, up from Dollars 63m, on revenues
of Dollars 898m, down from Dollars 983m.
Otis, the elevator group, made Dollars 98m, up from Dollars 84m on revenues
of Dollars 1.14bn compared with Dollars 1.12bn. Carrier, the air conditioner
company, made Dollars 85m, down from Dollars 93m, on revenues of Dollars
1.24bn, down from Dollars 1.27bn. Automotive made Dollars 53m up from
Dollars 42m, on revenues of Dollars 640m against Dollars 633m.
For the six months UTC had net income of Dollars 194m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, compared with Dollars 242m, or Dollars 1.79 last year before
accounting changes.
