FT  26 MAY 93 / International Company News: SGS-Thomson surges to Dollars
24.4m in first quarter


   By DAVID BUCHAN


   PARIS


SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian semiconductor maker, yesterday announced a
Dollars 24.4m profit for the first quarter of this year, after a total
profit of Dollars 3m for the whole of 1992.
This is the first quarterly report SGS-Thomson has filed, making comparisons
difficult, but it records a further step in the company's steady turnaround
from the Dollars 102m loss it made in 1991.
At the same time, the French government has clarified its strategy towards
the joint venture, which before last year's capital increase was held 45 per
cent by the French state, 45 per cent by the Italian state, and 10 per cent
by Thorn-EMI of the UK.
Mr Gerard Longuet, France's new industry minister, had created a stir two
weeks ago when he said that SGS-Thomson needed 'industrial partners' rather
than CEA-Industrie, the French nuclear operating agency which the previous
Socialist government brought into SGS.
Mr Longuet still wants big chip-users like Alcatel, the French
telecommunications group, to have a strong influence on SGS-Thomson's
industrial strategy, but not necessarily an equity stake in it.
Indeed he believes that it might even be better to keep private
shareholders, with their inevitable shorter-term financial considerations,
out of the capital of SGS which has to take a longer-run view of
semi-conductor development.
So, along with state-owned France Telecom and Thomson CSF, CEA-Industrie may
keep its equity stake in SGS-Thomson, provided this is kept quite separate
from its nuclear business.
