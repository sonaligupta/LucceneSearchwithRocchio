FT  15 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hornby warning hits share price


   By PETER JOHN


Old fashioned children may be wishing for a train set for Christmas, but
their dreams are not being translated into cash for Hornby.
The USM-quoted toys group yesterday issued a warning that profits for the
current year would be 'substantially lower' than last year's Pounds 1.72m.
The shares fell by 50p to 127p.
'It is going to be a poor Christmas. The turnover will be good because
people have money, but the profits won't because people will be waiting for
the sale bargains,' said one source close to the company.
Hornby may be synonymous with the golden age of railways, but the company
concentrates most of its precision engineering on Scalextric. The miniature
racing car game is largely responsible for an expected rise in turnover
above last year's Pounds 28.2m.
The cost of expansion overseas, together with a heavy advertising campaign,
has hit margins. Combined with the pressure on high street sales, this has
prompted analysts to forecast an annual profit of about Pounds 700,000, less
than half last year's figure.
