FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: US launches fund for Russia


   By FRANK MCGURTY


   NEW YORK


THE first investment fund supported by the US and Russian governments as
well as private American institutions was announced yesterday by
Vice-President Albert Gore and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime
minister, at a White House ceremony.
The Russia Country Fund will enable US financial institutions, such as
pension funds, for the first time to invest directly in private enterprises
in Russia and other former Soviet republics, with their investments
partially guaranteed by the US government.
The closed-end fund seeks to raise Dollars 100m in project finance and
venture capital for new businesses, expansions and privatisation, with an
emphasis on enterprises in the energy and environmental fields.
The Russian government will contribute up to Dollars 25m. The Overseas
Private Investment Corp (Opic), a US government agency set up to encourage
American investment in emerging economies, will provide a Dollars 50m loan
guarantee to protect private institutions providing the additional capital.
Investors will be offered what Opic described as a 'blended instrument',
composed of one-third equity and two-thirds debt. The agency will extend
guarantees on the principal and interest of the debt portion.
The precise terms of the Opic guarantee have yet to be finalised, according
to PaineWebber, the US securities house which will jointly manage the fund
with International Economic Co-operation, a Moscow investment management
company.
