FT  17 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Guarded outlook as PWS improves 7%


Pre-tax profits at PWS Holdings, the Lloyd's reinsurance broker, expanded
some 7 per cent over the 12 months to end-September 1991.
However, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, chairman, was guarded on current trading:
'Prospects for the current year are mixed; the . . . markets in which we
operate are in a state of considerable change. It is not possible to be at
all definite about 1992.'
The profits increase - from Pounds 2.67m to Pounds 2.86m - was achieved on
turnover of Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 13.8m) and struck after interest charges
reduced from Pounds 944,000 to Pounds 217,000.
Earnings per share emerged at 9.2p, down from 9.5p reflecting increased
capital after the previous year's rights issue. A final dividend of 2.5p is
recommended, making 4p (3.5p).
