FT  28 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Broome injured


David Broome's hopes of competing in a sixth Olympics seemed to be hanging
in the balance as the veteran showjumper was recovering from a fall from his
horse in a pre-Games event. The 52-year-old, who first competed in the Games
in Rome 32 years ago, injured his ribs in a tumble from a possible Olympic
mount while riding in France at the weekend.
