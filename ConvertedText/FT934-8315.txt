FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Usinor sees FFr5bn loss for year


   By JOHN RIDDING


MR Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel
group, yesterday forecast the company would suffer losses of about FFr5bn
(Dollars 847m) this year and that its results were unlikely to improve until
1995.
Mr Mer said the company continued to suffer from the sharp downturn in
international steel markets which had put strong pressure on volumes and
prices.
'Second-half results are likely to be around the same levels as in the first
half of 1993,' said Mr Mer, referring to net losses of FFr2.59bn which were
recorded in the January-June period.
The first-half performance represented a sharp decline on the same period in
1992 when the group reported losses of FFr200m.
Mr Mer said that the depressed state of the international steel markets
could result in the loss of up to 100,000 jobs out of a total of 350,000
employed in the industry in Europe. But he added that Usinor Sacilor would
not have to make sharp cuts in its workforce.
'Usinor will play only a limited role in this reduction since we began our
restructuring measures in 1984,' he said.
