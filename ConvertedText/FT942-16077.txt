FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux ahead at
FFr3.2bn

Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French construction, utilities and
communications group, raised net profits by just over 10 per cent last year
to FFr3.2bn (Dollars 545m), according to estimates announced by the company
yesterday.
The increase was achieved in spite of difficult conditions in the
construction and water services markets, and is higher than forecasts made
by the group at the end of last year when it launched a rights issue for
more than FFr3bn.
The company said it would propose a dividend of FFr44 per share, against
FFr43 in 1992, and it is planning to split its shares into four to improve
liquidity.
Final results are expected at the end of the month, although the company has
already announced that sales grew by just under 3 per cent last year to
FFr147bn. About FFr39bn of the total was generated outside France.
The group said there was a negative impact on profits from its property and
cable television activities. It is aiming to expand its activities in the
media sector. In February it took joint control of Canal Plus, the pay-TV
network, with Havas, the media company, and Societe Generale, the banking
group.
In a statement issued yesterday, Mr Guy Dejouany, chairman, said cashflow
during the year had risen slightly to FFr11bn.
Investments in 1993 amounted to FFr7.8bn as the company sought to expand its
presence outside France.
The strategy of reinforcing its international position has been continued
this year.
Last month, Generale des Eaux announced that it was raising its stake in Air
& Water of the US, from 23 per cent to 40 per cent.
