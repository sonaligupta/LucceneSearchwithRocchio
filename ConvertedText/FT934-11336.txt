FT  01 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: US job data awaited


   By PETER JOHN


ECONOMIC problems surrounding Belgium and France refuse to go away and could
prompt continued weakness of the respective currencies this week. Meanwhile,
many economists will be waiting for the latest employment data from the US,
writes Peter John.
Belgium's problems were highlighted on Friday by a mass trades union
demonstration to coincide with the EC summit in Brussels.
Workers protested at the government's plans to reduce wages and jobs and the
country's transport system was disrupted.
At the end of last week, some foreign exchange dealers said Belgian
companies were busy selling Belgian francs to ensure they were covered
against further falls in the currency.
Many financial markets are closed today for All Saints Day. Tomorrow France
and Germany will hold their twice-yearly conference on bilateral convergence
and any concrete statements on growth could give some help to the French
franc.
On Thursday, the Bank of France's weekly reserves statement is set to
attract attention. It will cover the period after the D-Mark slipped
following the Bundesbank's last interest rate cut. Economists have said the
Bank of France has been slow in rebuilding its reserves lost during this
summer's crisis over the European exchange rate mechanism and a short period
of D-Mark weakness against the franc might have given it a chance to redress
the balance.
On Friday, the US announces its employment figures for October and Midland
Global Markets forecasts a pick up of only 50,000 over the month compared
with 156,000 in September. However MMS International, the financial
information company believes the figure will rise by 165,000.
