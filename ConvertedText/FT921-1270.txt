FT  25 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Associates boost Fairhaven to Dollars 14m


Substantial income from associates enabled Fairhaven International, the
specialist construction company which was granted a full listing in
September 1991, to report pre-tax profits of Dollars 14.1m (Pounds 8m) in
1991, an increase of 39 per cent on the comparable Dollars 10.1m, which
included an exceptional gain of Dollars 1.42m.
Turnover was Dollars 308.7m (Dollars 301.1m). After a higher tax charge of
Dollars 4.3m (Dollars 1.63m) earnings per share came out at 4.01 cents (3.55
cents). A doubled single final dividend of 0.4 cents is proposed.
The company said that it believed 1992 would continue to justify the
strategy of concentrating on its core construction-related businesses.
