FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: British Alcan losses widen to Pounds 5.2m
as margins suffer


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


REDUNDANCY COSTS and recession in most European markets resulted in
increased losses at British Alcan Aluminium in the first half of 1993.
Losses before tax rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 5.2m and Mr Douglas
Ritchie, chairman, said: 'The business situation remains depressing,
although there are signs of recovery in the UK economy which have yet to
translate into improved revenue.'
He said trading conditions remained difficult with volume sales and margins
under pressure, particularly in European Community markets which 'are now
experiencing severe recession.'
Reflecting problems in its main export markets, sales of semi-fabricated
products fell by nearly 6 per cent or 8,000 tonnes in the first half to
131,400 tonnes.
In spite of difficult trading conditions, the company continued to generate
cash, repay debt and improve its balance sheet.
In the half-year another Pounds 17.2m of debt was paid off and gearing
improved from 37 per cent to 35 per cent.
Turnover fell from Pounds 384.8m to Pounds 381.1m but operating profits rose
from Pounds 5.8m to Pounds 8.7m. However, there was an exceptional charge of
Pounds 6m to cover re-organisation at the Rogerstone rolling mill, involving
246 job losses, and smaller numbers in Glasgow and Falkirk. In the first
half of last year re-organisation costs were only Pounds 500,000.
Interest payable fell from Pounds 10m to Pounds 7.9m. Tax was down from
Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 1.1m, leaving a net loss of Pounds 6.3m, compared with
Pounds 6.6m.
