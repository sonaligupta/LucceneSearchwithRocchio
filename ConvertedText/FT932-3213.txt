FT  15 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kyotaru shake-up chief quits

AN EXECUTIVE who transferred from Fuji Bank, the Japanese commercial bank,
to oversee the restructuring of Kyotaru, a leading restaurant operator, has
resigned after an apparent policy disagreement.
The dispute is one of an increasing number between Japanese banks and
clients over the adoption of tough measures to reduce debt and streamline
operations in line with bank recommendations.
Kyotaru said Mr Takeru Yamazaki, who transferred from Fuji Bank to become
vice-president of the company, had resigned for 'health reasons'. However,
the bank says he resigned because Kyotaru insisted on a
'self-restructuring', giving him little room to exercise influence.
The restaurant operator had agreed with its banks to reduce outstanding
debts from Y62bn to Y40bn (Dollars 375m) through the disposal of property
assets, the sale of three US subsidiaries, and the closure of 30 family
restaurants in Japan.
Kyotaru was forced to cover its losses following its guarantee of Y15bn in
loans for an affiliate, Edo Fudosan, which invested unsuccessfully in stocks
and property. In the year ended in December, Kyotaru reported a net loss of
Y12.2bn.
Fuji Bank, which holds a 4.8 per cent stake in the company, had taken a step
typical in Japanese restructurings by sending Mr Yamazaki, a former director
at the bank, to Kyotaru three months ago.
The disagreement between Kyotaru and Fuji Bank follows the dismissal of bank
advisers by Azabu Building, a developer with Y700bn in outstanding debts,
after they urged the sale of assets including a Hawaiian hotel particularly
cherished by Azabu's former chief executive.
