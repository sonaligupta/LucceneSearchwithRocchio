FT  10 JAN 92 / Reserves in UDR on full call-out


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


PART-TIME soldiers of the army's Ulster Defence Regiment were called out
yesterday for full-time duties in Belfast for the second time in two months
to try to stem a spate of terrorist violence.
The measure, which follows demands for army reinforcements after recent IRA
bomb attacks in the city, affects several hundred soldiers belonging to two
UDR battalions in the greater Belfast area.
Twenty-four hour road checkpoints will be reintroduced in the city.
Yesterday's move is aimed at containing the latest violence by redeploying
forces in Northern Ireland before resorting to reinforcements from the
mainland. Officials said troop requirements were 'constantly under review'.
There are 10,800 regular British troops in Northern Ireland plus 6,100 UDR
members, of whom about half are part-time.
Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, said yesterday he hoped that
emergency provisions legislation which came into force last August would
lead to the successful prosecution of the 'godfathers' of terrorism in the
province.
