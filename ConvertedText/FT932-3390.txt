FT  15 JUN 93 / Italian police arrest former telecoms chief


   By HAIG SIMONIAN


   MILAN


ITALY'S huge Stet public sector telecommunications group has been dragged
further into the national political corruption scandal with the arrest
yesterday of Mr Francesco Silvano, managing director until earlier this
month.
The detention of Mr Silvano, who gave himself up to Milan police, takes the
investigations into the telecommunications sector a further rung up Stet's
management ladder. Earlier arrests had involved executives of Stet
subsidiaries.
Telecommunications has become one of the most active areas of investigation
as magistrates pursue leads involving contracts with the former ASST state
telecoms agency. Inquiries are also believed to be proceeding on suggestions
that some telecoms companies have rigged bids. Last month, police arrested
Mr Luigi Montella and Mr Salvatore Randi, managing directors of Stet's Sirti
and Italtel subsidiaries.
