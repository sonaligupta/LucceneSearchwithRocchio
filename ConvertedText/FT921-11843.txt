FT  30 JAN 92 / North Korea rejects N-inspection

NORTH KOREA yesterday rejected a South Korean proposal for early inspections
of suspected nuclear facilities in both Koreas, South Korean officials said,
AP reports from Seoul.
But North Korea said the issue could be discussed after a meeting of the
South and North Korean prime ministers scheduled for February 18-21.
The Communist government's move amplified worries in the south that the
north was trying to gain time to develop nuclear arms.
A South Korean newspaper yesterday quoted an unidentified government
official as saying intelligence reports indicate North Korea may be able to
start reprocessing nuclear fuel as early as May. Once reprocessing begins,
there is a danger North Korea could hide its nuclear weapons programme, the
paper said.
'Concerns are being raised because the north expressed its intention to
refuse pilot inspections,' Mr Lee Dong-bok, a South Korean negotiator, said
after meeting North Korean officials.
