FT  11 JAN 92 / Legal filip for Japan's women


   By ROBERT THOMSON


   TOKYO


A COURT yesterday set an important precedent for equality in the Japanese
workplace by ordering a bank to recognise that women can be the head of a
household and have an equal entitlement to family allowances.
In settling a decade-old dispute, Sendai High Court ruled that the Iwate
bank had unfairly halted family allowance payments to an employee  - a
supplement on salary for spouse and children - after her previously
unemployed husband found a job.
The bank had argued that even though Mrs Reiko Sugawara, 61, had registered
as the household head, it was generally understood among Japanese that a man
is the family head and therefore the payments to her should be stopped.
Under the bank's employment regulations, which are similar to those of many
other Japanese companies, family allowances are paid to a male head of
household regardless of his wife's salary, but allowances are paid to a
woman only if her spouse's salary is less than Y1m a year.
The court ruled yesterday that this distinction is illegal under Japan's
Labour Standards Law and ordered Iwate Bank to pay Y1.3m in back allowances
to Mrs Sugawara.
Outside the courtroom, she said the decision was a sign that Japan is
'headed in the direction of equality', though many companies still routinely
discriminate against women.
Iwate Bank, which had appealed against a 1985 lower court judgment in Mrs
Sugawara's favour.
The Nikkeiren, the employers' federation, said that the judgment appears to
embody the spirit of the Equal Opportunities Employment Act of 1986:
Women account for about 38 per cent of Japan's labour force, up from 32 per
cent in 1975, as the country's labour shortage has encouraged companies to
offer more flexible conditions to married women, who traditionally left the
workforce.
