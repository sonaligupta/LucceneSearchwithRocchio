FT  30 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bromsgrove sale to consortium


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT


Bromsgrove Industries, the specialist engineering group, yesterday largely
withdrew from the automotive sector by selling its aluminium diecasting and
machining companies to a consortium led by Mr David Auty of Leicester for
Pounds 16.5m.
The consortium includes the management of the companies which will now be
grouped under the title of BSK Aluminium. These had combined sales of Pounds
30m in the year to March; in the six months to September Bromsgrove's
automotive division had operating profits of Pounds 646,000 from turnover of
Pounds 16.58m.
The sale is part of Bromsgrove's stated policy of divestment to allow for
the creation of larger profit centres.
It reflects concern at the continued pressure on margins in the automotive
sector and comes from an assessment that larger sums than Bromsgrove is
likely to have available, would be necessary to assure the future of the
companies in an industry of growing concentration.
Through 3i, the venture capital group, and Arthur Andersen, accountant, Mr
Auty has arranged Pounds 18.8m of finance to cover the purchase price and
Pounds 2.3m of extra working capital.
The financing is in two parts: Pounds 9m of equity from 3i and Pounds 9.5m
of working capital, senior and mezzanine debt from Midland Bank and Samuel
Montagu.
