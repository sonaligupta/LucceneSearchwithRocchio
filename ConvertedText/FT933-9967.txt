FT  06 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Barclays Bank


Barclays' large provisions on its US business plays into the hands of those
who argue that it has underprovided in the past. The bank admits that it
decided on the provisions only after a close review of businesses which it
intends to get out of. Admittedly, there is tactical sense in marking down
such assets ahead of sale, but there cannot be many problems in the US which
were not apparent at the end of last year. One wonders what similar close
inspection of other parts of its loan book would reveal. After the shocks of
1992, a loss of Pounds 60m on US mortgage processing business seems almost
trivial and was presented with scant apology. It is a large amount
nonetheless, and there is a prospect of more to come. That will be another
blot on Barclays' record, which is a pity because in other ways things are
looking up. UK bad debt provisions are 20 per cent below the first half of
last year. Unless the US experience is a harbinger of further second
thoughts, the fall in Barclays' provisions may not this time lag that of
other banks.
As with its competitors, the rise in dealing profits may not last, but
Barclays looks well-placed in terms of operating profit, not least because
of the benefit of cost-savings to come. Much of this recovery may already be
in the price, but a market capitalisation just below that of National
Westminster and first-half operating profit nearly 10 per cent higher helps
justify its relatively lower yield.
