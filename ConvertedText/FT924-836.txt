FT  22 DEC 92 / Channel Five Holdings to pursue bid


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


THE SHAREHOLDERS of Channel Five Holdings plan to continue toraise the money
to launch Channel 5 in spite of the Independent Television Commission's
rejection of its bid last week.
Thames Television and other smaller shareholders such as Mr Moses Znaimer,
the channel's programming consultant, have not ruled out seeking a judicial
review of the ITC's decision but are exploring ways of saving the project.
The central aim is to see whether the companies supporting the venture, such
as Time Warner, the world's largest media group, can be persuaded to come up
with firm commitments for Pounds 175m in the next 12 weeks. That would have
been the period between the award and the granting of the licence had the
ITC approved the bid.
The ITC rejected Channel Five Holdings mainly because of insufficient
shareholder support. Only 45 per cent of the financing was firmly secured:
35 per cent from Thames and 10 per cent from Time Warner.
There was further interest, however, from Time Warner and other companies
including Capital Cities/ABC, Cox, Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
and Associated Newspapers.
If the financing had been secured, the ITC's worries about the business plan
and the channel's revenues would probably have been overcome.
Sir Colin Southgate, chairman of Thorn EMI, Thames Television's majority
shareholder, said yesterday: 'We will support Thames in whatever they decide
to do.'
He described the ITC decision as unnecessary in that without the money the
consortium could not get the licence and without the licence it could not
get the money.
The ITC was unsure yesterday whether it could reopen the issue if the
financing for the project became available.
