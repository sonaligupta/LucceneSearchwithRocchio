FT  27 MAR 92 / People: Taverne for Indy finance


As part of a reshuffle designed to broaden top management at NEWSPAPER
PUBLISHING, owners of The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, Suzanna
Taverne, who joined 18 months ago as a strategic planning executive, becomes
the new finance director.
A 32-year old Oxford history graduate, she came to the Independent from SG
Warburg's corporate finance department, where she had been part of a team
advising the publishers. While a stock market floatation had earlier been on
the cards, by the time she arrived in August 1990 the effects of the
advertising recession, on top of strains imposed by the launch of the Sunday
newspaper, ensured that she was occupied instead with two rounds of
refinancing, helping bring in El Pais and La Repubblica which now hold 18
per cent each.
Taverne, the daughter of former Labour MP and early SDP promoter Dick
Taverne, takes over from Graham Luff, who became managing director in
November, shortly after the most recent refinancing. Luff's promotion was
seen as a step towards spreading the load of founder and editor Andreas
Whittam Smith, who however still retains the title of chief executive as
well as editor.
