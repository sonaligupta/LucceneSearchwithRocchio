FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Finance costs leave Grand Central down


Grand Central Investment Holdings, a chocolate manufacturing group with
interests in the Asia Pacific region, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
922,000 for the 1991 year.
The fall from the previous Pounds 1.34m was attributed to higher financing
costs associated with the takeover of Sunshine Allied Investments of
Singapore in October 1990.
Net interest charges amounted to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 571,000) but borrowings
have been sharply reduced since the year-end following an injection of
Pounds 9m of equity funding by Consolidated Resources, an associate of Anglo
American.
Turnover improved to Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 40.2m). After tax of Pounds
444,000 (Pounds 457,000) and minorities Pounds 765,000 (Pounds 120,000)
losses per share were 0.73p (2.03p earnings). Nevertheless, the proposed
final dividend is held at 0.7p for a total of 1.15p (1.1p).
