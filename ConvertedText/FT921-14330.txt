FT  16 JAN 92 / The Lloyd's Report - Analysis: Fund would be financed by
levy on premium income - Cap to limit losses


   By RICHARD LAPPER


THE recommendation by the task force of a high-level cap to limit excessive
losses for Names does not abolish unlimited liability, but is a radical
modification of the principle.
The market's recent losses have highlighted the risk of bankruptcy for Names
and many submissions to the task force urged an end to unlimited liability.
The task force's proposal calls for losses to be limited to an amount
equivalent to 100 per cent of a Name's annual premium income limit. It is a
cumulative scheme covering losses over four consecutive years which together
exceed the 100 per cent limit.
The fund would be financed by a compulsory levy on all Names equivalent to
0.25 per cent of their premium income limit (the maximum amount of premiums
a Name is allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules).
Names can now pull their exposure below that limit by purchasing stop-loss
reinsurance. Unlimited liability would remain, however, because a Name would
face further losses in circumstances that 'threatened the continued
existence of the market'. If the fund could not meet calls on Names,
liability would again fall on the Names. The scheme is expected to come into
effect at the beginning of next year but will not cover losses of Names
incurred before this year.
The task force says the scheme will provide more certainty to existing Names
and make the market more attractive for individuals. 'At present a wealthy
Name's upside is limited by the maximum premium limit allowed, but the
downside is unlimited.'
