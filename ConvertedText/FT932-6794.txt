FT  27 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US call for Japan market access


   By GEORGE GRAHAM and TIM DICKSON


   WASHINGTON


US officials yesterday claimed progress in talks aimed at opening up
Japanese financial services markets to US businesses, and said they would
press for an agreement on market access by the Group of Seven summit in
Tokyo in early July.
After talks in Washington between Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
undersecretary for international affairs, and Mr Tadao Chino, vice minister
for international affairs at Japan's Finance Ministry, a US official said
agreement on financial services was crucial to the general services section
of the Uruguay Round of talks on liberalising Gatt.
The US has pressed for greater access to securities underwriting, asset
management, banking and derivatives trading in Japan.
A Treasury official said the two countries had agreed to continue talks,
particularly on derivatives, including stock index futures and options.
Striking transatlantic differences in attitudes to international trade
agreements are revealed in a survey to be published this week, Tim Dickson
reports.
It shows that while a large majority of US chief executives consider the
North American Free Trade Agreement far more important than the Uruguay
Round of Gatt - and expect to benefit from it - their European counterparts
believe Nafta will have little impact on their economies.
Three out of five European chief executives believe agreement on the Uruguay
Round would strengthen their economies, with only half the Americans holding
this view.
The survey by the Conference Board also finds national budget deficits and
healthcare costs are top of both European and American worry lists.
