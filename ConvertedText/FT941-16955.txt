FT  07 JAN 94 / Brazilian car sector posts record sales

Brazil's car industry yesterday announced that 1993 was its best year since
the 1970s, with record car sales and increased profitability.
Vehicle production, dominated by US and European makers, increased almost 30
per cent to 1.39m units last year, compared with 1.07m in 1992.
Sales to the domestic market increased 43 per cent to 1.1m units, helped by
a moderate economic recovery and an agreement between the government and
manufacturers to lower prices for small cars.
Mr Luiz Scheuer, vehicle manufacturers' association president, said
production should continue to grow this year, although more modestly.
But motor executives admit privately that Brazil's overall economic
uncertainty, and a threatened tax increase on car sales, make predictions
difficult. Observers further caution that consumers are increasingly buying
cars as a hedge against inflation, which last year reached 2,500 per cent.
The figures also highlighted a rapid increase in foreign imports after the
1992 cut in import tariffs by former President Fernando Collor. According to
preliminary figures, imports roughly doubled to nearly 60,000 units in the
first 10 months of the year.
Excluding imports by companies such as Volkswagen, General Motors and Fiat
with operations in Brazil, imports more than doubled to 28,000 units and are
set to grow rapidly again this year, according to Mr Scheuer.
