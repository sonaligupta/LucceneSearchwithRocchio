FT  20 APR 91 / Letter: Labour needs to clarify nuclear policy


   From Mr CHRISTOPHER PATTEN MP.


Sir, Philip Stephens (Political Notebook, April 18) is not alone in
mistakenly believing that Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, gave a 'pledge
to keep an independent nuclear deterrent as long as the Soviet Union
maintains a nuclear arsenal' - but that is precisely the commitment which he
has always failed to give.
What he actually said at Tuesday's press conference was that Labour 'has at
no stage . . . made a commitment to get rid of all nuclear weapons for as
long as others have them' - a point reiterated by Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow
foreign secretary, who added that 'Labour's defence policy remains as set
out in detail' in the policy review statement 'Meet the Challenge, Make
Change'.
Of course Labour has not given a commitment to scrap the deterrent while
others keep nuclear weapons. The point is that Labour persistently refuses
to give any commitment to keep our nuclear weapons as long as other
countries also maintain them.
Labour's policy review statement to which Mr Kaufman referred categorically
states: 'Labour will immediately seek to place all Britain's nuclear
capability - including Polaris, and as much of Trident as has been completed
 -into international nuclear disarmament negotiation . . . Our aim is to
bring about the elimination of that capability.'
Not one word is said about doing so only if the other countries eliminate
their entire nuclear arsenals.
I have challenged Mr Kaufman to clear up this matter once and for all by
stating that a Labour government would keep a British nuclear deterrent for
as long as the Soviet Union or other countries have nuclear weapons. Until
this commitment is given, Labour policy remains one of unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
Christopher Patten.
