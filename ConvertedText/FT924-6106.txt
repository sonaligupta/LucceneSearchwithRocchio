FT  23 NOV 92 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (15): Sales bubble of
the 1980s bursts - Japan


   By EMIKO TERAZONO


JAPANESE truck makers, hit by the downturn in the country's economy, are now
hoping the government's public works programme will prop up demand. The cut
in capital spending by Japanese companies has caused truck sales to plummet,
and the end of the construction boom has added to the gloom.
Purchases of highly-priced products have been cut sharply, and sales in
medium and large trucks have been the hardest hit in the vehicle market. The
lengthy life span of commercial vehicles is also hampering demand growth.
The 4 per cent decline in corporate capital expenditure for the present
fiscal year is hurting truck sales. Large truck sales for the first 10
months of this year have fallen 20.3 per cent to 129,707 units from the
previous year. For the full year, sales are expected to be about 150,000
units, down sharply from the peak of 193,775 in 1990.
Profits for the truck makers have been hit accordingly. Hino, the industry
leader, with about 30 per cent of market share, said net profits for the
first six months to September plunged 66.8 per cent to Y1.64bn. Nissan
Diesel fared worse, posting a net loss of Y119m.
In the boom years of the late 1980s, the sharp rise in demand from
construction, real estate, and trucking drove up sales for truck makers.
However, the construction industry is likely to see more than a 10 per cent
fall in orders for the present fiscal year, and the transportation industry
is also experiencing a slowing in demand.
Hino, however, says it expects the government's public works spending
programme, which is part of the emergency economic package, to boost sales.
Last August, the Japanese government announced a Y10,700bn emergency
spending package to support the faltering economy, the bulk of which is to
be spent on public works. Hino says that the public works programme will
increase demand by some 20,000 units for the industry next year.
Mr Jonathan Dobson, motor industry analyst at brokers Jardine Fleming in
Tokyo, has his doubts. He says an increase in public works spending will not
necessarily mean new demand from construction companies, since the life
cycle of a truck is about 10 years. 'There were lots of trucks bought during
the bubble, and companies will bring those into use rather than buy new
ones.'
Additionally, most of the trucks are operated by non-construction-related
private companies. And since 70 per cent of vehicles engaged in
construction-related operations work for the private sector, which is not
expected to recover for another few years, the truck companies projections
may be over-optimistic.
Shin Maywa Industries, a leading maker of speciality vehicles, such as dump
trucks, concrete mixers, and tank lorries, says although public works
projects are definitely a positive indicator, the effects will take some
time to filter through. 'We probably won't feel the impact this fiscal
year,' says Shin Maywa.
Meanwhile, truck makers have turned to overseas markets, especially in
south-east Asia and the Middle East. Hino saw a 52 per cent rise in exports
for the first half, especially in Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia, while
Mitsubishi Motors said exports grew 22.1 per cent due to strong demand from
Saudi Arabia and Iran.
With the anti-inflationary policies through high interest rates eased in
Thailand and Indonesia, truck makers believe the fall in demand from
south-east Asia has bottomed out. The reconstruction of Kuwait is also
contributing to the rise in exports.
However, the rise in exports has not been able to compensate for the fall in
domestic sales. While increases in exports to China, India and Pakistan may
hold potential business opportunities in the longer run, truck makers admit
in the short term, profits will not be covered simply by exports.
The environmental issue is also pressuring profits, as the series of
government regulations over gas emission of trucks planned to start in 1994
is forcing companies to increase spending on research and development.
Most truck companies agree that times are hard, and many, including Hino,
are looking to diversify into other industries. Mr Koji Endo, analyst at SG
Warburg Securities in Tokyo, says while the government's public works
spending will provide underlying support, the industry may not see a
fully-fledged recovery until 1996.
One bright spot for commercial vehicles may be connected to the
environmental theme. The surge in the country's garbage waste has pushed up
demand for garbage trucks. Shin Maywa says sales over the next few years are
expected to rise by a stable 5 per cent.
