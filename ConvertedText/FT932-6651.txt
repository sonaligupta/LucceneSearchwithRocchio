FT  27 MAY 93 / NW Water in scrip dividend offer: Scheme likely to be
followed by other water groups


   By ANGUS FOSTER


NORTH WEST Water yesterday began the privatised water companies' reporting
season by announcing a 7 per cent increase in profits.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 230.1m to Pounds 247.1m in the year to
March 31, mainly because of price rises but helped by a larger contribution
from unregulated businesses like process equipment.
North West also announced it was offering shareholders an enhanced scrip
dividend. Like the other water companies, North West is unlikely to have to
pay any mainstream corporation tax for several years because of high capital
allowances.
The enhanced scrip scheme will help eliminate unrelieved advance corporation
tax. Money saved will be invested in North West's international business.
Ofwat, the water regulator, was informed in advance about North West's plan
and expressed no concern, the company said.
Analysts said other water companies are now expected to launch enhanced
scrip schemes over the next few weeks.
Turnover increased 11.3 per cent to Pounds 877.9m after average annual price
rises of 9 per cent. At the interim stage, profits were 5.7 per cent higher
at Pounds 130.7m on sales of Pounds 421.7m.
North West said it continued to cut costs and lifted operating profits 17
per cent to Pounds 288.2m. There were provisions of Pounds 36m for future
redundancies. Since 1991, staff numbers have been cut by 25 per cent to
5,400. Non-core businesses, built at a cost of Pounds 150m since
privatisation, made operating profits of Pounds 20.3m before development
costs for overseas projects of Pounds 9.6m. Lower costs at process equipment
lifted profits 42 per cent to Pounds 18m.
Interest costs more than doubled to Pounds 41.1m as the company's capital
spending programme gathered pace. Net borrowings increased from Pounds
296.4m to Pounds 534.6m. Gearing increased from 18 per cent to 29 per cent,
while interest cover remained comfortable at 6.9 times.
Earnings per share increased 7.6 per cent to 62.3p. The company recommended
a final dividend of 14.27p to make a total of 21.4p, an 8.8 per cent
increase. The enhanced scrip alternative is equivalent to a dividend of
21.405p. Swiss Bank Corporation has agreed to buy any new shares at a value
equivalent to 20.9769p, or 98 per cent of the enhanced dividend.
