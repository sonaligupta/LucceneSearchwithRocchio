FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rule change for Malaysian bourse


The Malaysian bourse regulator announced new rules for share dealings,
barring brokers from imposing indiscriminate buying restrictions pending a
complete review of broker practices by year-end, agencies report from Kuala
Lumpur.
The Securities Commission chairman, Mr Munir Majid, said 10 new rules would
serve as 'minimum standards of business conduct for all securities
transactions. We want to put these minimum standards in place at least as a
modicum of order to minimise investors' complaints,' he said.
