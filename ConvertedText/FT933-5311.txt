FT  03 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke active


   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Results from Ladbroke, the leisure and hotels group, were well received in
spite of being at the bottom end of market forecasts and the shares advanced
8 to 210p in very heavy turnover of 23m. A leisure specialist described the
interims as a 'fresh start' for the group, which saw senior management
changes following the retirement of Mr Cyril Stein as chairman.
There were signs of such a change late yesterday as two previously negative
houses were preparing to turn buyers of the stock. Analysts said the new
management's willingness to reconsider the group's dividend payment - some
in the market are forecasting a cut for the finals - was taken as a positive
sign. And the need for fresh capital through disposals or a rights issue was
also said to be on the management's agenda. Brokers' profits forecasts for
the finals came down to a range of Pounds 140m to Pounds 155m.
The group's Texas DIY chain was the worst performer and dragged down most
other DIY-related stocks. Kingfisher, owner of B&Q, fell 12 to 666p. Do It
All owners Boots and WH Smith lost 5 to 485p and a penny to 463p
respectively. By contrast, MFI gained 3 at 146p in very busy trade of 12m as
dealers reported a big buyer in the market.
A good performance from Ladbroke's hotel division helped Forte climb 8 to
244p.
Interim figures at the top end of expectations and an enhanced scrip
dividend alternative triggered a flurry of buying in Burmah Castrol, which
raced to an all-time high of 820p. The shares came off the top later in the
session to close a net 15 up at 813p.
Regarding the enhanced scrip dividend alternative, one of the oil sector's
leading analysts said: 'This is a clever and positive development and offers
a solution to the company's unrelieved ACT problems. It enhances earnings
per share.'
