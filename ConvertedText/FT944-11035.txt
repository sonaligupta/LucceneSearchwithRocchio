FT  08 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Beckenham suspended for second time in a
year


   By JAMES WHITTINGTON


Beckenham Group, the USM-quoted heating and ventilation engineer, yesterday
requested that its shares be suspended.
It is the second time in less than a year that dealings in Beckenham's
shares have been halted.
The latest move comes after a comprehensive restructuring of the group. Last
year, losses on contracts forced it into a capital reconstruction
pro-gramme, which included a placing and rights issue and the sale of
subsidiaries.
However, it continued to report losses, with an interim pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 2.6m in the period to April 30, compared with a Pounds 186,000 loss
12 months previously. Turnover fell from Pounds 17.4m to Pounds 13m.
Neither the company nor Townsley & Co, the housebroker, would comment on the
suspension. Mr Peter Long, chairman, hopes to make an announcement today.
