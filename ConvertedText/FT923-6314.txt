FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Rabobank growth slows to 2.6% in
first half


   By DAVID BROWN

RABOBANK, the co-operative bank with strong roots in the Dutch agro-business
sector, yesterday reported a modest 2.6 per cent rise in first-half net
profit, marking a further slowdown in growth.
Net profit advanced to Fl 544m (Dollars 340m) from the Fl 530m reported for
the same period last year.
The Netherlands' second-largest bank, Rabobank forecasts full-year profit
will rise only 'slightly' over the Fl 2.18bn level reported for 1991, with
higher funding costs putting profit margins and interest income under
further pressure.
Total income rose 7.3 per cent to Fl 3.47bn. The rise in costs was 8.6 per
cent to Fl 2.29bn, primarily due to previously agreed pay settlements in the
banking sector.
Helped by higher volumes and income from commissions, profit for the six
months advanced by 4.8 per cent to Fl 1.17bn, a result directors described
as 'satisfactory' in light of moderate economic growth and unfavourable
interest rate developments.
Lending to the private sector rose by Fl 5bn during the first half to reach
Fl 142.7bn, and Rabobank expects 'a lower but still not insignificant
expansion in the business volume' for the rest of the year.
The bank put its balance sheet total at the end of June at Fl 224bn, against
Fl 217bn at the end of 1991.
