FT  07 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei up again as Hong
Kong drops 6.5%

Share prices soared on active buying of high-technology stocks by overseas
investors, but later profit-taking by domestic corporations eroded some of
the gains and the Nikkei average closed just moderately higher, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index gained 98.51 at 17,881.99, while the Topix index of all
first section stocks finished 6.42 ahead at 1,469.27.
The Nikkei recovered the 18,000 level briefly during the first hour of
trading, rising to a day's high of 18,027.70 on buying led by US and Asian
investors as the weakening of the yen supported hopes of better profits for
exporters.
Traders said that extra income from hedging against yen assets for European
investors, due to interest rate differentials, also encouraged buying by
foreign investors.
However, profit-taking came in from corporate investors and life insurers
which had supported share prices when the Nikkei was around 16,000 last
year. This has made 18,000 a strong resistance level on the upside, and the
index fell to a low of 17,792.58 in the final 30 minutes of the afternoon
session.
Mr Jason James, a strategist at James Capel, expects the Nikkei to make the
upward breakthrough in the next few months, as institutions start to shift
funds to the stock market due to low interest rates.
Volume totalled 350m shares, against 290m. Advances led declines by 626 to
422, with 125 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 2.16
at 1,220.95.
Cable and wire companies were higher on reports of an expected proposal by a
government advisory body to replace the current television broadcast system
with a next-generation optical fibre cable-based system.
Fujikura rose Y47 to Y811 and Mitsubishi Cable gained Y24 at Y753. Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone, which has advanced technology development for
next-generation systems, put on Y13,000 at Y779,000. NEC added Y14 at Y906
and Fujitsu Y4 at Y870.
Some foreign favourites fell on profit-taking, Sony by Y50 to Y5,790 and
Matsushita Electric Industrial by Y20 to Y1,530.
Financials, which have been weak on arbitrage selling, gained ground.
Industrial Bank of Japan rallied Y40 to Y2,900 and Nomura Securities moved
ahead Y40 to Y1,890.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 163.45 at 19,755.21 in volume of 57.7m
shares.
Roundup
Aggressive profit-taking left Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur sharply lower as
Nomura reduced their weightings in its model portfolio, although further
records were set elsewhere in the region.
HONG KONG encountered heavy profit-taking which sent shares tumbling and
stripped 6.5 per cent off the Hang Seng index.
The market indicator fell 793.43 to its low for the day at 11,374.50, the
largest single day's decline since the 1987 stock market crash.
Turnover was the third highest ever at a provisional HKDollars 13.07bn,
topped only by the two previous days' records.
However, the market's second consecutive daily fall caused little concern,
coming after last year's 115 per cent gain in the index, much of it in the
last quarter.
KUALA LUMPUR suffered its largest ever single day fall, tumbling 5 per cent
amid heavy profit-taking. The index, which had risen by 235 points over the
last fortnight, shed 65.77 to 1,248.69.
BANGKOK tumbled 2.4 per cent as institutions joined individuals in taking
profits among the big capitalisation stocks for the second straight day. The
SET index fell 41.70 to at 1,667.94 in near record high turnover of
Bt38.86bn.
SINGAPORE continued lower for the second consecutive day, the market losing
1.8 per cent as investors took profits aggressively. The Straits Times
Industrials index fell 43.73 to 2,388.26.
MANILA surged anew as foreign and domestic institutional demand emerged for
second liners, after Wednesday's correction. The Manila index climbed 62.16
to 3,293.33.
SEOUL was helped ahead by strong interest in blue-chips although financials
and low-priced shares lost ground. The composite index added 6.24 to a
record 893.17 in heavy volume.
AUSTRALIA saw a late revival in the resources sector which pushed the market
off its day's lows to yet another six year high.
The All Ordinaries index closed 6.9 higher at 2,200.3, a level it tested but
which it was unable to hold on Wednesday.
JAKARTA was mixed in active trading with stocks seemingly unaffected by
Indonesia's cautious budget announcement.
The JKSE market index turned back from Wednesday's four year high, losing
3.57 to 609.32.
BOMBAY picked up towards close, after a mild drop at mid-session, as buying
by Indian brokers and institutions continued on the last day of the current
account period. The BSE 30-share index closed up 52.80 at a record 3,506.88.
KARACHI posted a record close, the KSE 100 index adding 53.73 to 2,327.33 on
active foreign buying in multinationals and blue chips.
NEW ZEALAND nudged ahead the NZSE-40 Capital index rising 6.02 to 2,198.82
in good volume.
