FT  23 APR 93 / Production of cars rises 7.7% to a 19-year high


   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent


CAR production rose by 7.7 per cent last month to its highest March level
for 19 years, boosted by the build-up of output from the British factories
of Nissan, Honda and Toyota of Japan.
Figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and the Central Statistical Office showed that UK car output rose to 144,212
from 133,881 in March last year.
Production in the first three months of this year rose by 6.2 per cent to
364,420 from 343,318 in the first quarter of last year.
The strong performance of the car sector is not reflected in the commercial
vehicle industry, where UK demand remains depressed and output has been
lowered by the collapse of Leyland Daf into administrative receivership in
February.
Commercial vehicle output in March fell 24.5 per cent to 22,036, while
production in the first quarter was 11.6 per cent lower at 59,100.
The rise in car output has been helped by rising export volumes from the
Japanese producers' UK plants and by the growth of registrations of new cars
in Britain.
After 3 1/2 years in recession, domestic sales of new cars have grown
year-on-year for each of the past six months.
In contrast to plunging demand in continental Europe, the UK is the only
large-volume market in west Europe where sales are expanding. In March car
output for the home market rose by 13.6 per cent to 88,904 while production
for export declined marginally to 55,308.
Mr Roger King, SMMT public affairs director, said the car production figures
were 'most encouraging and are the highest for March since 1974.
'They suggest that car manufacturers expect domestic sales to increase,
going some way towards making up for the expected decline in other European
markets.'
