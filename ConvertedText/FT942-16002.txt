FT  13 APR 94 / Peace move in European motor industry

   LONDON, BRUSSELS


European carmakers and automotive components suppliers yesterday launched a
joint initiative aimed at improving the often hostile relationships between
the two sides of the motor industry.
The two European trade associations representing the vehicle-makers and
their suppliers agreed a set of guidelines to encourage improved
co-operation. The aim is to improve the competitiveness of the European
motor industry as it seeks to restructure to meet the fierce challenge from
the US and Japan.
The protocol agreed yesterday will determine 'fundamental principles' and
'framework for co-operation.'
The industry associations accepted that the guidelines could not give a
legal or contractual definition to the relationship between vehicle-makers
and component suppliers.
Improving relations has been seen as pivotal in raising the sector's
international competitiveness, but the positive rhetoric has seldom been
matched by practical steps.
A recent report in the UK sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry
and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders was highly critical. 'The
mistrust which is in evidence is the result of many years of broken
promises, abuse of confidence, and general acrimony in the industry,' it
said.
The guidelines agreed yesterday seek to create greater transparency in
negotiations over costs and prices; to improve co-operation in design and
manufacturing processes; to promote the effective adoption of modern
manufacturing processes and to spread continuous quality improvement.
