FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Arts Council open-minded on dance


   From Ms PRUDENCE SKENE


Sir, In his article on modern dance ('Modern dance in dire straits',
November 10), Alastair Macaulay claims to be basing his conclusions on 'the
facts'. He suggests that the Arts Council has agreed to the formation of a
revised Rambert and told London Contemporary Dance Theatre to reduce its
size or close.
The fact is that in the case of London Contemporary Dance Theatre, it is the
board of governors of Contemporary Dance Trust, and not the Arts Council,
that has taken decisions on the future of the company. London Contemporary
Dance Theatre has been without a permanent artistic director for almost five
years, and for more than a year we have been waiting for the board to make
an appointment and, following that, to produce strong artistic plans.
The Arts Council has kept an open mind and does not have preconceived
notions of what London Contemporary Dance Theatre should be or do. We shall
of course give careful consideration to any proposals put forward to us by
Contemporary Dance Trust.
The Arts Council recently announced its commitment to supporting the
development of a broad range of contemporary dance. As the recipient of the
largest Arts Council grant to any contemporary dance organisation, London
Contemporary Dance Theatre's future direction must be considered in detail
by the dance panel. The dance panel has encouraged Contemporary Dance Trust
to submit plans, which can be considered alongside proposals from other
dance companies, including Rambert. The Arts Council has yet to respond to
the plans already put forward by Rambert's board and will be making no
decisions about dance funding until the grants for 1994-95 are finalised
next month.

chairman of the dance panel,
