FT  03 AUG 92 / Opposition threat to Mexico's PRI


   By AP


   DURANGO


MEXICO yesterday put its democratic reforms to the test in elections in six
states, AP reports from Durango. As the polls opened yesterday morning, the
conservative opposition National Action party (PAN), fresh from victory last
month in the border state of Chihuahua, held high hopes of adding another
governorship in Durango, just to the south.
Elections for governor were also being held in four other states, while Baja
California voters were choosing mayors and a state legislators. A series of
opposition victories could cause tension within the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary party (PRI). The Chihuahua victory was only the second
gubernatorial victory by an opposition party in any of Mexico's 31 states
since the PRI was formed in 1929.
Some polls showed the two parties neck and neck in Durango. The PAN
candidate, former Durango city Mayor Rodolfo Elizondo, is also backed bythe
leftist Democratic Revolution Party. He was opposed by Mr Maximiliano
Silerio Esparza, former head of the national peasants' union and of the
federal land reform agency. The Baja California election is the first
statewide election held in modern Mexico under an opposition party. The
government recognised the 1989 victory of Governor Ernesto Ruffo of PAN.
