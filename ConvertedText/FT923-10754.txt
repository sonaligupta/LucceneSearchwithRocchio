FT  29 JUL 92 / Letter: Initiative offers focus on value of training


   From Sir ALLEN SHEPPARD


Sir, An article in the FT ('Employers consider seeking approval from
Investors in People', July 22) rightly points to the growing employer
involvement in Investors in People - an initiative supported by business as
well as government and delivered through the Training and Enterprise
Councils, and about improving training investment and performance of people
at work.
I have led the National Training Task Force steering group on Investors in
People.
The first Investors in People were announced last October. Today, there are
68 with more than 1,100 employers involved. As your article points out,
those involved include Unilever, Shell, Boots and J Sainsbury. But
involvement goes far wider - it embraces small businesses, schools, local
authorities and hospital trusts.
This initiative has the capacity to transform the performance of people and
the organisations for which they work. At Grand Metropolitan we regard it as
a key initiative which offers a new and clearer focus on the contribution
training can make to our business, both in the UK and overseas. Investors in
People challenges us to review and improve what we do.
Because it is challenging and adds real value it takes time to become an
Investor in People. The real measure of achievement is in the 1,100
employers involved, taking action and improving their performance. The 68
Investors in People show what can be achieved and how the rest of us can
follow and benefit.
