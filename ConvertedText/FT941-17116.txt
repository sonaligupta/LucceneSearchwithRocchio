FT  06 JAN 94 / People: Tate moves to Sorbus Europe


Lee Tate, who was responsible for the launch and development of
International Network Services, the UK-based electronic trading pioneer, has
been appointed managing director of Sorbus Europe - another of ICL's
multinational joint ventures.
Sorbus Europe is a joint venture operation between ICL, the UK-based
computer group, and Bell Atlantic Business Systems International of the US
and is one of Europe's leading independent computer maintenance and support
groups.
Tate, 54, has a high reputation in the IT industry having been managing
director of INS since its launch seven years ago. During that time INS
increased both its revenues and profits each year operating in the fast
expanding field of electronic data interchange which companies use to
replace traditional paper-based forms such as orders, invoices and other
business-to-business communications.
Tate's move to Sorbus coincides with a reorganisation at INS under which GE
Information Services of the US has purchased ICL's 50 per cent shareholding
in INS to make it a wholly-owned GEIS subsidiary. The sale of ICL's stake
reflects the group's strategy of developing its core businesses.
Tate has been succeeded as managing director of INS by John Thorpe, 44, who
was previously director of software at INS and has been a director with the
company since it was launched in February 1987.
Under Tate INS is expected to concentrate on developing software for
worldwide sales and developing more value-added applications which will
enable customers to benefit from GEIS' portfolio of electronic commercial
services.
