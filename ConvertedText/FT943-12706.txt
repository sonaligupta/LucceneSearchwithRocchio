FT  23 JUL 94 / Ffestiniog wins fight for rail route


   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent


A fierce battle between rival steam railway companies for control of a
23-mile stretch of disused line through Snowdonia national park has been
decided this week.
Mr John MacGregor, in one of his last acts as transport secretary, gave
approval for the Ffestiniog Railway to acquire the railway bed against a
rival claim from the Welsh Highland Light Railway.
In deciding in favour of Ffestiniog Mr MacGregor overturned the
recommendation of the inspector who chaired a four-week public inquiry into
the rival bids last year.
His ruling clears the way for Ffestiniog, which already runs a successful
steam railway over a 13-mile route between Blaenau Ffestiniog and
Porthmadog, to create a 36-mile loop through the national park to the
tourist centre of Caernarfon on the north Wales coast.
Mr MacGregor came down in favour of Ffestiniog in part because of its
experience. The company, which employs 60 people alongside 6,000 volunteers,
expects to invest Pounds 350,000 in its existing line this year. It carries
nearly 200,000 people a year with a turnover of Pounds 2m.
Work on restoring a service on the disused track bed could take up to 15
years to complete and cost between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m.
Mr Gordon Rushton, the general manager of the Ffestiniog Railway, is
offering the Welsh Highland Light Railway, an entirely voluntary
organisation, the chance to co-operate on the project but considerable
bitterness remains between the two.
Disputes between rival railway enthusiasts are not uncommon. The Association
of Railway Preservation Societies said it was a pity so much money, which
could have been spent on restoring the railway, had been wasted on legal
expenses.
The decision in favour of Ffestiniog could be seen as a further small step
down the road towards privatising Britain's railway network. The Welsh
Highland bid had the support of Gwynedd county council and a number of other
local councils - one reason for the inspector recommending Welsh Highland at
the inquiry.
But Mr MacGregor concluded that the inspector had attached 'too little
weight to the benefits of placing such matters entirely within the private
sector'.
