FT  28 JUL 92 / Richmond flotation questioned


   By PEGGY HOLLINGER


INVESTORS in Richmond Oil and Gas, which has seen its shares plummet from a
peak of 173p to last night's 6p, may have been misled in the weeks following
the company's 1989 flotation, according to a preliminary report compiled by
Price Waterhouse.
The report, commissioned by authorities in Jersey pursuing a local
complaint, has sparked a Serious Fraud Office investigation into the
company's share dealings.
In the course of its investigation, Price Waterhouse has discovered what
appears to be evidence of a 'circle of funds'. The accountancy firm suggests
this gave the impression that the sub-underwriting for Richmond's offer was
fully financed.
According to Price Waterhouse, various amounts of money totalling Pounds 16m
were pumped repeatedly around the circle via three bank accounts in the 10
days after the July 10 closing date for the flotation. The circle appears to
have been 'kick-started' with funds from client accounts at Bryant & Co, a
Jersey accountant.
Richmond came to the market at 105p in July 1989, with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 68m. Only 12.2 per cent of the shares were taken
up, however, amid concerns about the valuations of some reserves and the
company's lack of a trading record. Shares closed at 62p on the first day.
Two weeks later, the shares began a climb to peak at 173p in June 1990. They
then began a virtually unbroken decline.
Richmond retains few of the assets it had at flotation. Creditors foreclosed
on the main remaining property, the Johnson Ranch, last month. The company
is now focusing on two joint ventures - one in Siberia and the other on
Apache lands in the US.
