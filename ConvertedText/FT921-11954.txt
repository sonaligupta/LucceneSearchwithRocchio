FT  29 JAN 92 / Gamsakhurdia loses stronghold


   By REUTER


GEORGIAN government forces yesterday seized Poti, one of the last
strongholds loyal to the republic's ousted president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia,
after a day of fighting in which at least six people died, Reuter reports.
Government troops met little resistance on moving into the Black Sea town.
Armoured vehicles rumbled along the streets as residents, mainly supporters
of Mr Gamsakhurdia, boarded up windows and remained indoors. The head of the
town's hospital and local officials said six people had been killed and at
least 20 others injured in fighting around a bridge to the north of the
town.
Mr Gamsakhurdia, elected by a landslide last May, fled to Armenia three
weeks ago after losing a bloody power struggle with the ruling Military
Council. He later returned to west Georgia, but his whereabouts have been
unknown for the past week.
The fall of Poti was another serious blow to his attempt to regain power. He
can now rely on support only in the port of Sukhumi to the north and the
town of Zugdidi to the east.
