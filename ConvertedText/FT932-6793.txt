FT  27 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Delors makes services deal new Gatt
priority


   By LIONEL BARBER


   BRUSSELS


MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, yesterday signalled a new
flexibility in the Gatt global trade talks, urging all sides to agree to
liberalise services such as banking and insurance.
The call marks a shift in emphasis since, six months ago, Mr Delors was
outspoken in his defence of European farm interests in the Uruguay Round.
The new focus on services echoes long-standing US and British arguments that
the EC - and particularly France - should pay less attention to agriculture.
Mr Delors' remarks came in a speech to the European parliament in
Strasbourg, and reflect his concern about rising unemployment in the EC and
the Community's diminishing competitiveness.
In his speech, Mr Delors noted that between 1970 and 1990 the US had created
29m jobs, Japan 11m, and the EC 8.8m. 'We need to think about that - and to
underline (our) interest in a Gatt agreement.'
The Commission president, who has ordered a study of Europe's
competitiveness and the unemployment crisis, recalled that services made up
half of EC GNP but only 20 per cent of EC exports.
US and EC negotiators are making good progress in their efforts to wrap up a
substantial Gatt market access package at the Group of Seven industrialised
nations' summit in Tokyo in July, according to senior officials on both
sides.
Both stress that Japan's willingness to offer greater access in financial
services will be critical to a deal. The idea is to set a market access deal
alongside the US-EC Blair House accord to form a broad foundation for a
comprehensive agreement to complete the Uruguay Round this year.
