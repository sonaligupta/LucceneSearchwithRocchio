FT  26 MAY 93 / ECGD unit sale 'was reasonable'


   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor


THE government substantially achieved its objectives when it sold the
short-term insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to
NCM, the Dutch insurance company, the National Audit Office says in a report
published today.
The public expenditure watchdog says that the sales proceeds of Pounds 20m
were reasonable in the circumstances. The direct expenses of the sale - at
Pounds 6.7m - reflected its unusual complexity and specialised nature.
NCM's bid was the lower of two bids received for the sale - the government
was offered Pounds 25m for the business by Generali, the Italian insurer.
However, the audit office says that the successful bid more closely met the
other objectives of the sale, such as ensuring that the purchaser would
provide the maximum credit insurance support to the widest range of UK
exporters.
While most of the 760 staff transferred to NCM, the department was left with
more than 100 surplus staff not required by the new owner. At one stage, 80
of these were on paid leave, though almost all have now found jobs in other
public bodies or have retired early.
Export Credits Guarantee Department: Sale of Insurance Services. HMSO,
Pounds 7.40.
