FT  13 APR 94 / UK Company News: Year of change at Hemingway


Hemingway Properties under-went significant change in 1993. Although the
pre-tax loss was only cut from Pounds 855,000 to Pounds 837,000, net assets
per share improved from 26.1p to 31.1p.
Having started the year with 90 per cent of its portfolio represented by
London offices, it ended with 40 per cent industrial and 29 per cent retail
and a wider geographical spread.
The group made two purchases totalling Pounds 65.2m, funded by issues of
shares, loan stock and debentures, and sold an interest in a London property
for Pounds 21.8m. It also sold two of its acquired properties to show a
surplus of Pounds 490,000.
Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, chairman, said that rental income in the present
year 'should comfortably exceed interest payable and administrative
expenses'.
Gross rental income was Pounds 4.82m (Pounds 4.19m). Losses per share were
1.07p (1.57p).
