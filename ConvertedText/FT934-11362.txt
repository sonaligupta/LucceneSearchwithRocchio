FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Syntegra launch marks start of BT market
push


   By ALAN CANE


BRITISH Telecommunications is refashioning its image as a computer systems
designer and constructor in a move to capture a larger share of a market
currently worth Pounds 25bn annually.
It will today announce that its customer systems division will be renamed
Syntegra. The move marks the first part of the company to be rebranded to
broaden its appeal to a world market.
Syntegra will remain a wholly owned profit centre within BT.
It will be controlled by Mr Bill Halbert who has been managing director of
BT customer systems since 1990.
Last year the division turned over about Pounds 200m, one of only three
British companies among the top ten computing services groups in the UK.
It is said to be 'significantly' profitable, although its figures are not
broken out separately in BT's results.
It does 80 per cent of its business in the UK; one reason for the rebranding
is to improve its international appeal.
Mr Alfred Mockett, managing director of BT's business communications
division, said Syntegra would establish strategic relationships with
customers around the world providing both new revenues and stimulating use
of BT's international network services.
