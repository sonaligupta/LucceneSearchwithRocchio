FT  12 MAR 92 / Venzuela stresses anti-corruption fight


   By JOE MANN


   CARACAS


VENEZUELA'S President Carlos Andres Perez has named an anti-corruption
campaigner as interior minister as part of a new cabinet of national unity
that includes two figures from the main opposition party.
The appointment of Mr Luis Pinerua Ordaz to one of the most powerful jobs
after the presidency is intended to satisfy popular demands for a serious
government attack on corruption and violent crime.
Although Mr Pinerua has long been prominent in the ruling Democratic Action
(AD) party, his appointment represents a blow to many other senior figures
in the party.
Most of AD's leadership see the new minister as a maverick figure who may
try to put some of their party brethren behind bars.
Mr Perez also named six other new cabinet ministers, but kept the
government's free-market reformers in place in other key ministries and in
the presidency of the central bank.
The president thus refused to cave in to demands that he roll back unpopular
economic reforms initiated three years ago.
