FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paramount battle to move to
courtroom


   By MARTIN DICKSON


   NEW YORK


THE Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications will shift to
the courtroom tomorrow when QVC Network, having increased its hostile offer
to Dollars 90 a share on Friday night, will ask a Delaware court to create a
'level playing field' between it and counter-bidder Viacom.
QVC is asking the court to remove 'lock-up' provisions of Viacom's friendly
merger agreement with Paramount.
The provisions would give Viacom a Dollars 100m consolidation prize if a
rival bidder wins the battle, as well as the right to buy 20 per cent of
Paramount's stock on very favourable terms.
QVC made its increased offer on Friday night conditional on the Delaware
Chancery Court removing these barriers to its bid.
The company is now offering Dollars 90 a share in cash for 51 per cent of
Paramount and stock worth around the same amount for the other 49 per cent.
Viacom is offering Dollars 85 a share in cash for 51 per cent and stock for
the remaining 49 per cent.
