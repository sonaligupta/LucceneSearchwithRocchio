FT  06 AUG 93 / Swedish rates cut to 10-year low

SWEDEN, engulfed by last year's ERM crisis, yesterday took advantage of its
position on the sidelines of the latest upheaval by announcing a cut in
interest rates to the lowest levels for more than 10 years, to encourage
recovery from the country's deepest recession since 1945.
A strengthening of the Swedish krona since the weekend allowed the Riksbank,
the central bank, the scope to cut its key marginal rate from 8.5 to 8.25
per cent, despite the bank's official view that it would like to see a
further rise in the currency's value.
Yesterday, the krona stood at SKr4.68 against the D-Mark, up from near
SKr4.75 at the end of last week.
The contrast with the events of last autumn was stark. Then, overnight
lending rates were pushed up to 500 per cent in a vain bid to keep the krona
pegged to the ERM as Sweden prepared to join the European Community. Since
then, the marginal rate has been steadily brought down from the level of
12.5 per cent last November.
The benefits of looser monetary policy and increased export competivity are
the chief hopes for a return to growth next year after three successive
years of contraction in the economy.
Mr Thomas Franzen, Riksbank deputy governor, said there was no early
intention to reinstate a pegged exchange rate.
Finland is in a similar position. It recently revised downwards its
forecasts for the economy, predicting a 2 per cent fall in GDP this year and
only 'minor' growth next year, rather than the 3.5 per cent growth it had
foreseen.
In both countries, unemployment is expected to go on rising into next year.
