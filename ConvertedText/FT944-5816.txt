FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (3): Leader 3i hones its
competitive skills - Participants, Richard Gourlay looks at a familiar
picture


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


As the UK management buy-out industry enters an era of respectable maturity,
a glance down the top 10 deal leaders, lenders, mezzanine providers and
arranging accountants reveals a familiar picture.
There has been some rearrangement in the middle ranks, with some houses
elbowing their way a few places higher and others slipping. But there are
few new names, upsets or significant departures.
Below the surface, however, there are a number of developments that hint at
the way the management buy-out business could develop in the UK in the next
few years.
Funds are being raised in novel ways; banks not seen since the late 1980s
are protesting they never left the market and laying out their wares once
more; and the largest equity provider, 3i, is honing its competitive skills
under the public gaze of a new set of shareholders after its summer
flotation.
On the equity side, 3i remains at the top of the pile in terms of numbers of
deals led, its 17 transactions more than double the total for Natwest, the
nearest rival. Focused on smaller deals, 3i's average deal at Pounds 20m is
only a quarter the size of those backed by CINVen, which leads the funding
table with total funding of Pounds 561m.
But before its flotation, 3i introduced the first of a series of new funds
which could put providers of equity to middle-sized deals under considerable
competitive pressure.
Its newly-launched fund for co-investing with UK institutions will invest in
management buy-outs larger than Pounds 10m. The Pounds 150m fund - half
provided by 3i - will not only earn the group a management fee.
The fund will also allow 3i to reduce the amount it is forced to syndicate,
or hand on, to other venture capitalists in the market.
It will reduce third-party access to deals originating from 3i's network of
regional offices.
And the new fund will give 3i greater fire power and appetite for the
mid-sized MBO deals, an area where it has not recently been strongly
represented.
This could also increase the trend for venture capital houses to develop
regional offices or national office networks to move closer to the local
accounting firms that are an increasingly important source of deal flow.
It might also lead to some houses considering moving out of London
altogether to offices nearer the source of deals.
On the debt side, 1994 has been a year of transformation. Bank of Scotland
and NatWest, the most visible lenders over the past three years, have been
joined by an army of banks seeking to put assets on their books.
Notable among the new arrivals is the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose head of
corporate finance, Leith Robertson, moved from Bank of Scotland.
Aggressively back in the market are Morgan Grenfell, Midland Bank and Samuel
Montagu.
As a result commitment fees and the typical interest rate spread have both
fallen to below two percentage points.
Other banks with recently awakened appetites have been less responsible.
Some have tried to buy market share, pushing up the price of deals and
offering more debt to back the higher valuations. While this has not yet led
to deals being structured with very demanding levels of gearing, the
appetite of some banks is making some equity providers distinctly edgy.
This willingness to lend has had a detrimental knock-on effect for the
mezzanine market where Intermediate Capital Group - which also floated this
year - remains by far the largest debt supplier.
The greater availability of pure debt has meant that the amount of mezzanine
supplied so far this year in the UK has fallen quite sharply.
In effect the banks are prepared to take more risk for a simple debt reward
and are to some extent 'stealing mezzanine's clothes', according to one
observer.
One of the most intriguing changes in 1994 has been the way new funds are
being raised. The big funds, like Candover and Charterhouse, appear to have
raised large funds in the conventional manner, involving long-term
commitments from fee-paying institutional investors, mainly in the US.
But some new fund raisers are rocking the boat. For example, 3i is only
charging a management fee on its larger buy-out fund when it has commited
funds to an investment. Similarly, Legal & General, which last year raised
funds for the first time from sources other than its parent, has ruffled
feathers.
'The standard partnership has a five-year investment programme,' says
Charles Peal, managing director of Legal & General Ventures. 'Ours is a
one-year investment programme. You can join it for that year and if we have
not spent the money your commitment is released.' The investors have the
option to renew or not to renew.
Where Peal has made himself particularly unpopular is in the structure of
fees. In the first year L&G looked beyond its parent for funds. It charged a
management fee only when the money was committed and then at half the
prevailing market rate. This year, because deal flow is slower it is
charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 1 per cent after funds are
commited.
L&G hopes to raise Pounds 150m a year - two thirds from its parent - on this
basis. If the practice spread, fund-raising would become an annual event - a
prospect that weary venture capitalists, who have spent the past 18 months
raising new funds, find too appalling for words.
It is too early to say if this practice will spread. Low commitment fees and
annual roll-over of funds do not necessarily go hand in hand with good
investment decisions.
And there are other drawbacks. As Chris Beresford, head of corporate finance
at KPMG, says; 'It's a very high risk strategy - a bit like sitting down on
the eve of your wedding anniversary and asking your wife if she wants to
remain married to you.'
