FT  15 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation indications leave
equities higher

Wall Street
US shares rose solidly yesterday as relatively mild economic statistics
encouraged investors that the Federal Reserve would not lift interest rates
next week, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 30.95 at 3,746.29. The
more broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 4.82 to 454.97, the
American Stock Exchange composite rose 2.84 to 423.07 and the Nasdaq
composite gained 6.17 at 725.66. Volume on the New York SE amounted to 355m
shares.
Inflation has yet to seep into final goods prices, according to figures
released by the Labor Department showing that the consumer price index rose
0.3 per cent in November, putting inflation for the year at 2.7 per cent.
The core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, was up only 0.2 per
cent, less than economists had predicted.
Although the Fed has focused on rising industrial production and
intermediate prices in determining its monetary policy, the low CPI figures
led some investors to believe that there would be no interest rate increase
at the December 20 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee meeting.
In recent weeks the market has been skittish as investors worried that more
tightening by the Fed would dampen earnings growth, but yesterday the Dow
rose more than 40 points in the afternoon before slipping back by the close.
Also reassuring to the market was the fact that there were no surprises in
yesterday's capacity utilisation or industrial production figures. Capacity
utilisation - the percentage of capital being used in the economy for the
production of goods - grew to 84.7 per cent, its highest level in more than
five years.
Although utilisation figures of 82 to 85 per cent are generally considered
signals of future inflation, the data did not rattle the market because it
was well within the range of expectations.
Total production grew by 0.5 per cent in November, matching October's
figure, which was revised downwards.
Shares in cyclical companies received a boost as fears were eased of another
interest rate increase, with the Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks
rising 1.6 per cent. Dow Chemical moved ahead Dollars 3 to Dollars 66 7/8 ,
Caterpillar Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 , Motorola Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 56 and International Paper Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/2 .
Sprint gained Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 30 3/4 after the US telecommunications
company announced that it would form a long-distance venture with Telmex,
the Mexican telephone monopoly.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceuticals group which is majority owned by
Rhone-Poulenc, of France, extended Tuesday's slide, dipping Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 37 1/4 . The shares fell 8 per cent on Tuesday after US regulators
recommended against giving the company early approval for a new cancer drug.
Other pharmaceuticals stocks were mixed. Eli Lilly put on Dollars  5/8 at
Dollars 62 1/8 . Canada
Toronto put on a good performance as US economic data helped to ease
inflation fears. Strong showings by heavily weighted banking, consumer and
industrial products stocks gave a boost to the TSE 300 composite index in a
day of broadly based gains.
The index finished 34.44 higher at 4,078.85 and advances outscored declines
by 416 to 370 after volume of 64.8m shares. Twelve of the 14 sub-group
indices were up, with only real estate and pipeline issues posting losses.
Mexico
The market lost an initial rise to end slightly lower on balance, taking its
decline to a fifth straight session, on unconfirmed local reports of
scattered shooting between the army and rebels in the state of Chiapas.
The reports, filed by local news wire Infosel and uncorroborated by other
local services, hit an already nervous market and cut heavily into an early
gain booked by telephone giant Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex).
Telmex's rise was initiated by Tuesday's late news that an accord had been
signed between Sprint, of the US, and Telmex on the provision of
long-distance telephone services between the two countries. Even though
Telmex was trading at a 12-month low on the opening, the Chiapas situation
proved too much for the market to handle, dealers said.
The IPC index was 6.44 points down on the day at 2,401.55. Volume totalled a
light 497m new pesos on 40m shares traded. Telmex 'L' series shares - those
available to foreign investors - closed a net 4 centavos up at 8.9 new
pesos, after surging 2.5 per cent at the opening.
