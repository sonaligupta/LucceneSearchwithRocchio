FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Accounting change hits WD & HO
Wills


   By NIKKI TAIT


WD & HO Wills, the Australian tobacco group 67 per cent-owned by BAT
Industries, saw net profits fall 52.1 per cent to ADollars 15.4m (USDollars
11.1m) in the year to the end of December, on unchanged sales of ADollars
934m.
However, the decline was entirely due to a large ADollars 62.9m abnormal
item (up from a ADollars 10.3m charge the previous year).
Of this, ADollars 43.5m was explained by a change in the accounting basis
for tobacco licence fees. The remainder was attributed to restructuring
costs and property write-downs in manufacturing and distribution operations.
Wills said the underlying performance had been 'robust,' although sales
volume in Australia was down by just over 6 per cent in 1993, a trend it
blamed on tax rises.
Operating profits for the group overall, before abnormals and tax, rose 24.4
per cent to ADollars 84.9m.
The company's Papua New Guinea operations saw 'solid' profits growth,
although some overall market share was lost. The Fiji and Solomon Islands
operations had 'good years'.
Wills also announced plans to install a ADollars 40m tobacco leaf primary
processing plant at its Pagewood factory, and said it had decided to
contract out its distribution operations. This change will start to take
effect in the latter half of 1994.
