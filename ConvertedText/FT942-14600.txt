FT  20 APR 94 / Vote of confidence for revamped European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development


   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRYSTIA FREELAND


   ST PETERSBURG


The revamped European Bank for Reconstruction and Development received a
'unanimous vote of confidence' from its board and a raft of expensive new
commitments at the close of its annual meeting, write Anthony Robinson and
Chrystia Freeland in St Petersburg. Mr Pedro Solbes, Spain's finance
minister, was also appointed chairman of the board.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the bank's president, promised 'a robust approach'
to cutting costs and 'value for money' by co-financing projects aimed at
developing private sector banks and businesses. But several governors,
including Mr Kenneth Clark, UK chancellor, urged a further cut in costs by
reducing the 23-member board which accounts for 12 per cent of the bank's
costs. Others called for the appointment of more east European
representatives to the senior management structure.
The president underlined that financing infrastructure projects remained a
key part of the bank's activities despite the elimination of a separate
development banking department. The new commitment to operate in all 26
client states, including less devloped areas like Ukraine and central Asia,
is expected to increase the demand for infrastructure development to
underpin the private sector. The bank will also extend its nuclear safety
programme.
