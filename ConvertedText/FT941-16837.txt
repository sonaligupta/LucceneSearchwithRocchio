FT  07 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Rugby sells French glass processor


Rugby Group has sold Vertal, its French glass processing business, to
Glaverbel of Belgium for Pounds 5m cash.
Rugby said Vertal had been operating in increasingly difficult market
conditions and was no longer regarded as a core business. Rugby will
continue to develop its UK glass business.
Loss on the sale, after writing back Pounds 4.9m goodwill, was expected to
be about Pounds 1.3m, which will be charged against profits in 1993 as
required by FRS 3. Vertal's net assets at completion were Pounds 1.3m.
Rugby's borrowings were reduced by Pounds 9.8m by virtue of the sale.
