FT  19 APR 94 / People: Kuenssberg takes over at Dawson


Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textile group, has reorganised
itself to take account of the closure announced last month of its fleece and
jersey business in the US, which caused it to make provisions of Pounds 50m.
Philip Kemp, who built up the company's US operations and ran them as Dawson
Consumer Products, has resigned and leaves the board.
Nick Kuenssberg (right), formerly ceo of Dawson Premier Brands, the other
division which handled the company's knitwear and yarn operations, becomes
md of the entire company under executive chairman Sir Ronald Miller. The two
division structure, which was only introduced two years ago, disappears and
the remaining US operations will report to Kuenssberg.
Kuenssberg, 51, joined Dawson in 1991 from Coats Viyella. Peter Forrest, 55,
md of premier fibres and yarns, becomes a director. He joined Dawson in 1991
after working for the Legler Stoffel textile group in Italy.
