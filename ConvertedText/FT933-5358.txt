FT  03 SEP 93 / International Company News: PCT slips to Pounds 0.75m but
senses upturn


PCT Group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 751,000 for the six months to
June 30, against Pounds 925,000.
The USM-quoted engineering equipment company blamed adverse economic
conditions in the UK and the Continent.
Directors said that the first half saw no signs of recovery in the UK and
margins remained under pressure. However, there were encouraging prospects
for the present six months, particularly in export markets, but the
unsettled UK market continued to delay improvements in profitability.
Turnover fell slightly to Pounds 10.5m (Pounds 10.7m). Interest payable fell
to Pounds 278,000 (Pounds 320,000). Earnings per share came out at 6.08p
(7p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.5p.
