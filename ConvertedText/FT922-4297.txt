FT  06 JUN 92 / Running of atomic unit is put out to tender


   By DANIEL GREEN


THE GOVERNMENT is to go ahead with the privatisation of the management of
its nuclear weapons programme and has asked four companies to bid for the
contract, Daniel Green writes.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said the defence ministry
had invited tenders to manage its Atomic Weapons Establishment unit based in
Aldermaston, Berkshire.
The contract will run for seven years from April next year and will
principally involve the Trident nuclear submarine programme.
The four companies invited to bid are British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, GEC
and the Hunting-Brae naval shipbuilding consortium, which has been involved
in running AWE since October 1990 in a pilot for the privatisation.
