FT  16 MAR 94 / Lords reluctantly approve amendment to police bill


   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent


The House of Lords yesterday reluctantly approved complex provisions which
put into effect a government climbdown over the appointment of police
authorities.
They were described as an 'elaborate farce' by Lord Callaghan, former Labour
prime minister, who forecast they would be swept away when parliament next
dealt with legislation on the police.
Tory backbench peers, whose condemnation of the powers originally sought by
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, forced his retreat, also criticised
the length and complexity of the amendments.
Earl Ferrers, Home Office minister, said the 'complicated arrangement' which
peers had been asked to insert into the police and magistrates' courts bill
would ensure that members of police authorities would be 'wholly and truly
independent'. Membership would normally include nine councillors and three
magistrates, and five independent members co-opted from 10 names provided by
the home secretary. Earl Ferrers said he would now choose the 10 from a
shortlist of 20 provided by a local selection panel.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour speaker in the debate, urged peers
to accept the new provisions in the interests of reaching an agreement which
would not be overturned in the Commons.
