FT  05 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Tussauds invests Pounds 28m in Spanish
theme park

The Tussauds Group, a subsidiary of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
is investing up to Pounds 33m in a theme park that will open at the resort
town of Salou, south of Barcelona, next spring.
The UK group is to make an initial Pounds 27.5m investment to acquire a
40.01 per cent stake in the theme park, known as Tibigardens, with an option
to acquire a further 10 per cent within five years of its opening.
Tussauds will obtain the contract to manage Tibigardens and provide Pounds
9.8m in loans for start-up costs. The venture represents its first big move
outside the UK where it owns Alton Towers and Chessington World of
Adventures.
Tibigardens is a smaller scale Euro Disney and aims to draw some 3m visitors
from April to October.
A key attraction for Tussauds is understood to be the potential partnership
possibilities it offers with Anheuser-Busch, the US food and drinks group
whose leisure arm, Busch Entertainment, designed Tibigardens and owns 20 per
cent of its equity.
Busch Entertainment runs nine theme parks in the US and chose Salou as its
first European investment shortly after Walt Disney opted for Marne La
Vallee, near Paris.
The other shareholders are La Caixa, Spain's leading savings bank, and
Fecsa, the local electricity utility.
