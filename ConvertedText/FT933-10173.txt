FT  05 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Chieftain in red after write-off


CHIEFTAIN Group, the USM-traded specialist insulation and fireproofing
company, incurred an interim loss of Pounds 481,000 and yesterday reiterated
its forecast of a 'small' deficit for the full year.
Mr Peter Wardle, chairman, pointed out that the pre-tax loss for the six
months to June 30 was struck after providing an exceptional Pounds 990,000
for two branch closures and write-off of work in progress and debtors
following the appointment of receivers at Swan Hunter Shipbuilders, one of
the group's main clients.
The outcome, which compared with profits of Pounds 620,000 last time, came
on turnover of Pounds 7.36m (Pounds 7.63m). Mr Wardle said the order book
stood at Pounds 6.5m at the period-end and had 'prospects to substantially
improve on this by the end of the year'.
Losses per share emerged at 3.76p (earnings of 4.85p); the interim dividend
is reduced from 2.1p to 1.5p.
