FT  06 JAN 94 / Options for paper group narrow


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


The main institutional shareholders in Newspaper Publishing, the holding
company for The Independent and the Independent on Sunday, have made clear
that they do not want to put more money into the group, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
Institutional shareholders - which include Standard Life, Scottish Amicable
and the Prudential - hold 52 per cent of the loss-making business.
Their unwillingness to invest more narrows the options for Newspaper
Publishing and concentrates the search on potential trade investors.
The search comes at the same time as approval of a business plan that
envisages a return to profit in the 1994-95 financial year with serious
profits the year after. The company lost Pounds 486,000 pre-tax in the year
to September.
The business plan promises editorial improvements, a sustained marketing
campaign, improving the money raised by advertising and stringent cost
control which will include 'modest' across-the-board cuts in staffing.
Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, the main founder of The Independent, and two
newspaper investors - El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - favour
bringing on board one of four national newspaper groups, Mr Conrad Black's
Telegraph Group, Mirror Group Newspapers, Lord Rothermere's Associated
Newspapers or United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express.
No deal has been concluded yet and no talks have been held with United. Mr
Black is a clear option but MGN, now emerging from the financial
difficulties caused by the late Robert Maxwell, is increasingly seen as a
serious runner.
