FT  30 JAN 92 / The Bush Budget: Push to stimulate short-term growth - Tax
changes


   By MICHAEL PROWSE


THE budget proposes an array of tax changes intended to boost short-term
economic growth, writes Michael Prowse. Biggest surprise is a Dollars 25bn
(Pounds 13.8bn) cut in the amount of personal income tax to be withheld by
employers this year. This will boost the disposable income of the average
taxpayer by about Dollars 350. The move does not need congressional
authorisation.
Lower withholding of taxes should take effect by March 1, if not before. But
total tax liabilities will not be reduced over time, because tax refunds due
next year will be correspondingly reduced. Other temporary measures that do
require congressional approval include:
Temporary tax credit for first-time home buyers of 10 per cent of purchase
price up to Dollars 5,000, if buying before January next year. Those selling
houses at a loss would be able to deduct losses in excess of 10 per cent of
income.
A temporary investment tax allowance, equivalent to 15 per cent of purchase
price of assets (not real estate) if purchased before next January and put
in service by June 1993, in addition to existing depreciation allowances.
Proposed permanent tax code changes include:
An increase in the personal exemption, now Dollars 2,300 a person, by
Dollars 500 for each child under 18, to take effect from October 1. The
relief would be phased out for families earning more than Dollars 157,000.
A cut in the maximum tax on capital gains, now 28 per cent, to 15.4 per cent
for assets held for more than three years, 19.6 per cent for assets held for
two years and 23.8 per cent for assets held one year.
A new Flexible Individual Retirement Account (FIRA). Individuals earning up
to Dollars 60,000 (couples Dollars 120,000) would be able to contribute
Dollars 2,500 per person. No tax deduction up front but interest would
accumulate tax free if deposit held for seven years.
Liberalisation of existing Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Waiver of
penalty on withdrawals to fund medical and educational expenses. First-time
home buyers can also withdraw up to Dollars 10,000 for deposits on homes.
Permanent extension of R&D tax credit. A 20 per cent tax credit for selected
R&D spending had been due to end this June.
Allowing developers and renovators of houses to deduct 'passive losses' on
real estate transactions; Allowing a tax deduction for interest on loans to
pay for college or post-secondary vocational education.
Repeal of luxury tax on boats and aircraft but not other items. Health care
reform plans also call for a tax credit for poor families of up to Dollars
3,700 to help finance health insurance premiums.
