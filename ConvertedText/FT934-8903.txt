FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco deal


   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON


Food retailers were once again prominent as one institution baled out of
Tesco, BZW buying the 29m shares at 173p and placing them in the market at
174p. Another institution is believed to have bought the entire stake.
The deal took turnover in the supermarket group to 65m shares, the biggest
daily volume for six years. The shares moved up as news of the deal reached
the market, dealers observing some buying interest in the stock at these
levels. They closed 4 ahead at 183p.
However, Tesco was not immune from the continuing stream of negative notes
on the sector, with James Capel yesterday joining the list of brokers to cut
forecasts for the leading supermarket stocks in the wake of the recent price
war developments. In addition, Hoare Govett and Smith New Court both issued
sell notes on J. Sainsbury. Its shares slid further, although a late rally
limited the fall to 2, closing at 366p. Kwik Save shed 7 to 592p and Argyll
Group 2 to 249p.
