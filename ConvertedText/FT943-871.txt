FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Wellcome ends cancer drug trials


   By DANIEL GREEN


Wellcome has abandoned research on one of its more promising drugs intended
for use in cancer and organ transplants.
Campath 1-H, licensed from British Technology Group, was set for launch in
1997 and had potential sales of Dollars 250m (Pounds 158m) a year, according
to Lehman Brothers, the stockbroker.
Wellcome said data from the latest clinical trials showed only low or
moderate efficacy and therefore 'this compound is not likely to have
adequate commercial potential'.
The drug had reached phase two of human clinical trials, a relatively late
stage in the expensive development process for a drug to be recognised as a
failure. Wellcome had been conducting trials with it since 1991.
The areas of study were in cancers including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in
advanced rheumatoid arthritis, a condition caused by the failure of the
immune system.
