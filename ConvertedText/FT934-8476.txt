FT  16 NOV 93 / World News in Brief: Pollution ruling


The National River Authority won a pollution judgment which may worry

properly convicted after unknown dumpers polluted a river. The fact that the
pollution was not due to the water company's negligence was 'neither here
nor there', one judge said.
