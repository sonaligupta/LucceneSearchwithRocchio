FT  21 JUL 94 / UK Company News: McKay shares jump on sharp advance to
Pounds 3m


Shares in McKay Securities rose 16p to 187p yesterday as the property
investor and developer reported doubled pre-tax profits for the year to
end-March.
The profits increase - up from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 3m - was helped by a
reduced interest charge of Pounds 2.57m, against Pounds 3.89m, and benefited
from the absence of one-off charges - last year's figure included Pounds
686,000 of refinancing costs.
Gross rental income was marginally down from Pounds 8.96m to Pounds 8.39m as
were service charges, which amounted to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.88m). Income
from investment properties also fell, from Pounds 7m to Pounds 6.49m.
Comparatives were restated to comply with FRS 3.
Earnings per share emerged at 10.7p (4.2p) and a recommended final dividend
of 3.1p raises the total for the year to 5.2p (3.5p).
