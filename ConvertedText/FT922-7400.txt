FT  19 MAY 92 / Plastow joins Inchcape as chairman


   By JANE FULLER


SIR DAVID PLASTOW is to become chairman of Inchcape, the motor and business
services group, after his retirement from Vickers, the engineering group
that includes Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.
Sir David has just reached 60 and retires as chairman and chief executive of
Vickers at the end of this month. He begins in September at Inchcape, an
international distributor of cars, consumer goods and business machines and
a provider of services such as insurance and shipping.
He is leaving Vickers at a difficult time. The company made a pre-tax loss
last year, the dividend was cut and many jobs were shed. It also remains
unclear whether Rolls-Royce will be kept, after it survived Sir Ron
Brierley's attempt to demerge it two years ago.
However, Sir David's decision to retire at 60 was taken in 1983 and his
successors - Sir Colin Chandler as chief executive and Sir Richard Lloyd as
non-executive chairman - were named more than a year ago.
The chairmanship of Inchcape is the latest and most important of a series of
board appointments Sir David has lined up over the past year. He is already
joint deputy chairman of Guinness, the drinks group and his new positions
include one in banking - deputy chairman of TSB Group - and a directorship
at Cable and Wireless, the telecoms group.
Sir David will work two days a week at Inchcape's head office in St James's,
London. His role will include overseeing the board and communicating with
shareholders. He said: 'I see no clear definition between being executive or
non-executive chairman.'
