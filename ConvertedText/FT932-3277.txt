FT  15 JUN 93 / Observer: Horses for courses


If there are any gamblers left among the Buba-watching fraternity, the
guessing game as to who will be number two to Hans Tietmeyer, due to take
over as president of the German central bank this autumn, is still wide
open.
The previous favourite, Reimut Jochimsen, appears to have fluffed his
chances through his open antagonism to the Maastricht process, and the
punters are having to re-study their race card.
From the back of the field, but already counted one of the surer bets, comes
council new boy Horst Schulmann, 60, who arrived back from Washington only
last October as president of the central bank of Hesse.
It was Schulmann who, as Helmut Schmidt's 'sherpa', worked hard on
convincing a sceptical Bundesbank to accept the EMS in the first place. He
has experience at the EC Commission on his side, and the politics also fit.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, which will make the selection, is
likely to go for an SPD candidate if only because it needs the opposition's
co-operation if it is to cut into welfare spending.
Meanwhile, Johann Gaddum, chief architect of the bank's recent 'dribbling'
approach to interest rate cuts, would probably be the most deserving winner.
But he's both the wrong political colour, and, with only just over a year to
retirement, a little old.
The intriguing outsider is Edgar Meister, finance minister of the Rhineland
Palatinate, Kohl's political training ground. He has the invaluable merit of
being on good terms with the beleaguered Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance
minister charged with slashing spending, and a man in need of all the
friends he can find, especially in the Bundesbank.
