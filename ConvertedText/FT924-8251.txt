FT  12 NOV 92 / International Company News: Improved beer sales help SAB
group to lift earnings by 7%

IMPROVED profits from the beer division helped South African Breweries
(SAB), one of South Africa's leading industrial companies, record a 7 per
cent increase in attributable earnings to R252m (Dollars 84m) in the six
months to the end of September, compared with R236m a year earlier.
A 13 per cent increase in attributable earnings from the beer division to
R184m from R163m helped offset a 7 per cent fall in earnings from SAB's
other interests to R68m from R73m. These include retail, manufacturing,
hotel and international activities
Beer volumes rose marginally compared to 1991.
Group turnover rose by 29 per cent to R10.29bn from R7.99bn, but this figure
was inflated by the acquisition in April of the Plate Glass group. Stripped
of this, turnover rose by 10 per cent on a comparable basis.
Operating profits rose by 18 per cent to R901m from R765m. But a higher tax
bill and a 52 per cent increase in the share of profits attributable to
outside and preference shareholders to R129m from R85m caused attributable
profits to rise by only 7 per cent to R252m from R236m. This performance was
in line with market expectations.
Mr Meyer Kahn, executive chairman, said that the 'severity of the prolonged
recession in South Africa, together with the lack of any meaningful progress
in eliminating the root causes of the prevailing socio-political turmoil,
continues to have a devastating effect on consumption expenditure in the
mass consumer markets.'
Private consumption expenditure in the South African economy is expected to
decline this year for the first time since 1985.
SAB's furniture, retail and textile interests, which are traditionally very
cyclical operations, have been hardest hit. Even Edgars, the retail fashion
group with a formidable earnings track record, managed to lift attributable
earnings by only 4.5 per cent.
Looking ahead, Mr Kahn said the short-term outlook both in the domestic and
main international economies remained 'extremely uncertain'.
He said there was little prospect for recovery in personal disposable
incomes before the latter part of 1993 and predicted that the rate of
improvement in group earnings would remain 'severely constrained' over the
rest of the financial year.
Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 93.4 cents from 88.2 cents on an
attributable basis. The dividend is being raised by 6 per cent to 35 cents a
share from 33 cents.
