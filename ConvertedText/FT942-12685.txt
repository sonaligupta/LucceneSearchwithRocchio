FT  28 APR 94 / UK Company News: Data and Research Services coming to market
at Pounds 39m


   By ALAN CANE


Data and Research Services is coming to the market by way of a placing which
values the automated data capture specialist at Pounds 39.2m.
Some 13.64m ordinary shares are being placed at 110p each, representing 38
per cent of the enlarged share capital.
Some Pounds 15m is being raised before expenses. About 50 per cent of the
proceeds are expected to be available to exploit possible acquisitions in
the data capture industry. They will also be used to fund market research
and technology development necessary for DRS to explore new areas for
automated data capture.
The placing is sponsored by MacArthur, the company's financial adviser, and
underwritten by Beeson Gregory, its brokers.
DRS has been involved in data capture - ways of getting information into a
computer system without the use of keyboards - since 1969.
The company started as a data capture bureau, but its turnover and
profitability grew rapidly after 1990 when it began to make and distribute
its own design of opticalmark readers and dataloggers.
In 1993, it turned over Pounds 11.6m and made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m.
In the past three years, profits before tax and non-recurring operating
expenses have amounted to 22, 22 and 26 per cent of turnover respectively.
At the placing price, earnings per share in 1993 of 6.76p give a p/e
multiple of 16.3.
The company's chief market is education, where it sells equipment to capture
and analyse handwritten 'ticks' on multiple choice examination forms.
Dealings are expected to begin on May 5.
