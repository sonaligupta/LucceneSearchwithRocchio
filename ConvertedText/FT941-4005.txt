FT  14 MAR 94 / Balladur visits French troops in Bosnia


   By REUTER


   PARIS


French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur paid an unannounced visit to French
troops serving with United Nations peacekeepers in former Yugoslavia
yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Balladur went first to Zagreb, Croatia, and was due to visit the Bihac
pocket in northern Bosnia, aides said.
He was accompanied by Defence Minister Francois Leotard on his visit to
units which came under Serb fire last week, when artillery rounds hit French
positions and a 22-year-old soldier was killed by a sniper.
French commanders are reported to be irate since a request they made for
Nato aircraft to strike back at the Serbs was turned down by UN commanders.
The Bihac pocket, where about 1,300 French troops are stationed, is a
Moslem-inhabited enclave surrounded by Serb troops.
