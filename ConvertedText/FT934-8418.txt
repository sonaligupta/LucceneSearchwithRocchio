FT  16 NOV 93 / Health targets 'need more work'


MORE HARD work will be needed to meet some of the government's Health of the
Nation targets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday.
The Health of the Nation strategy is intended to produce measureable
improvements in the areas of coronary heart disease and strokes, cancer,
mental illness, sexual health and accidents.
Mrs Bottomley said that figures for 16 out of 19 targets were moving in the
right direction. But this was not the case with obesity, suicide and smoking
among young people.
