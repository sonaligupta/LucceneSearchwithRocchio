FT  27 JAN 94 / Plea over river pollution upheld


The National Rivers Authority yesterday won a High Court ruling that
companies can be found guilty of causing pollution through their operations,
even if the offence is the result of actions by employees who cannot be said
to be part of the 'controlling mind' of the organisation.
Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Morland allowed the NRA's appeal
against a decision by magistrates at West Malling, Kent, in January last
year that a construction company could not be held responsible for polluting
a stream and causing death to fish.
Alfred McAlpine Homes East was prosecuted after wet cement was washed into
the Ditton stream while homes were being built at Goldwell Springs, East
Malling, in May 1992.
The magistrates held the company had no case to answer because two
employees, who accepted responsibility for the pollution, were not 'of a
sufficiently senior standing'.
Ordering a rehearing of the case before a fresh bench, Lord Justice Brown
said: 'An employer is liable for pollution resulting from its own
operations, carried out under its essential control.'
McAlpine Homes was refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords.
