FT  05 JUN 92 / Navy targets 1,150 job losses


   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent


THE NAVY will seek 1,150 redundancies next year, including 450 officers.
They are in addition to 400 redundancies planned this year.
The measure was announced in a written parliamentary reply by Mr Archie
Hamilton, the armed forces minister. It underlines the difficulties all
three forces are having in achieving their planned reductions in manpower
simply by limiting the inflow of recruits.
Some of the redundancies are expected to be compulsory, as in the first
batch. The navy said it might need a third tranche.
The normal outflow from the armed forces has slowed down, partly because of
a generally adverse job climate and partly because personnel who might have
left are now hoping to benefit from redundancy deals. In the navy's case,
that involves at least 18 months' pay in addition to earned pension rights.
Targets fixed by the government last summer involve reductions of 40,000 in
army personnel, 14,000 in the Royal Air Force and 8,000 in the navy by the
mid 1990s.
The army sent out 3,350 redundancy notices in February and plans two larger
batches next year and the year after.
A limited RAF redundancy programme from 1993 to 1995 was announced last
month, involving 1,150 jobs.
The navy is trying to save its fishery protection squadron from proposals to
hive off that job to the private sector. The proposals, now before a cabinet
committee, are aimed at reducing the annual Pounds 6m paid to the navy by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for patrolling fishing
grounds.
