FT  29 JAN 92 / Third westerner may run east German state


   By QUENTIN PEEL


A west German candidate, Mr Bernhard Vogel, former prime minister of the
Rhineland Palatinate and close confidant of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, seems
certain to become the third western prime minister running a former east
German state in the federal republic, reports Quentin Peel.
The move by the dominant Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in the state of
Thuringia amounts to a calculated risk by the Chancellor to bring his
eastern house into order.
The danger is that it will further infuriate east German opinion, already
bitter at the behaviour of westerners in enforcing the free market economy
on their collapsed socialist system.
The benefit is that it could provide new leadership to an eastern CDU which
has so far failed to produce outstanding personalities, and is torn between
politicians tainted by co-operation with the former Communist authorities,
and angry young reformers without experience of office.
Mr Vogel, head of the Konrad Adenauer Institute, a CDU think tank in Bonn,
has been proposed by Thuringian Christian Democrats to their Free Democrat
partners in government after the resignation last week of Mr Josef Duchac.
Mr Duchac had been under pressure after revelations he had once performed as
a clown to entertain the officers of the former East German Stasi security
police.
Reports from Erfurt, the capital of Thuringia, yesterday showed conflicting
reactions. Some said Chancellor Kohl was showing typical 'Wessi' arrogance
towards the East, foisting his own candidate on the local party. Others
admitted that easterners did not trust anyone from their own land.
