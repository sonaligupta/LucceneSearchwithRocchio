FT  13 APR 94 / Finns to join Nato partnership


   By REUTER


   HELSINKI


Finland plans to take part in Nato's Partnership for Peace plan for military
co-operation but it is not seeking new defence solutions, according to the
prime minister, Mr Esko Aho (pictured above right with Mr John Major, his UK
counterpart, on a London visit). He said, however, that the move was not a
step towards membership of Nato.
All non-Nato countries in Europe were invited to join the scheme two months
ago, but Mr Aho stressed that Finland's situation was different from that of
the former members of the Warsaw Pact. 'So Finland's role in this issue will
be different from that of the east European countries which have a security
policy interest in this,' he said. 'We only want to give our support.'
