FT  25 MAR 92 / International Company News: Second-half turnround at Cathay
Pacific


   By SIMON DAVIES


CATHAY Pacific Airways, the international airline subsidiary of Hong Kong's
Swire Pacific group, announced a significant recovery in the second half of
1991, with net profit for the full year falling to HKDollars 2.95bn
(USDollars 380m), only 1.5 per cent below 1990's figure of HKDollars
2.995bn.
Cathay had posted a 21 per cent drop in earnings at the interim stage, and
the full-year results were above market expectations.
Earnings benefited from the weakening of the US dollar in the second half of
the year, due to the amount of non-US/HK dollar denominated revenues. The
airline also achieved improved productivity levels.
Mr David Gledhill, chairman, said: 'The year's results have been greatly
influenced by the Gulf war and the continuing worldwide recession.' There
was also an impact from the rising fuel price during the war and increased
price competition 'as airlines struggled to conserve or improve cash flow',
he said.
There was a marginal decrease in passenger load factors, falling from 75.9
per cent to 73.6 per cent during the year, reflecting the weak market during
the Gulf war.
Mr Gledhill was upbeat about the prospects for 1992, despite continuing
double-digit inflation and the uncertain economic outlook.
'We look forward to a more prosperous 1992, albeit with some caution in
respect of the progress of the world's major economies,' he said. However,
he emphasised the need to contain costs in an inflationary environment, in
order to benefit from the airline's higher capacity increase in 1992.
The company recommended a final dividend of 31.5 cents, bringing the full
year pay-out to 42 cents, the same as in 1990.
