FT  24 NOV 92 / Observer: Leaks


Rumours circulating before last Saturday's rugby test with Australia at
Cardiff Arms Park that Spillers, the pet food manufacturer, was thinking of
sponsoring the revitalised Welsh team next season, have proved groundless.
While the sponsorship would benefit the team's finances, it was felt that it
wouldn't do much for the company's well-known brand - Winalot.
