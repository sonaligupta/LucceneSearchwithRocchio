FT  27 MAY 93 / EC jobs plan aims to halve unemployment


   By ANDREW HILL


THE European Commission yesterday unveiled a job-creation strategy which it
hopes will help halve unemployment in the EC by the end of the century,
writes Andrew Hill. At the same time, Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs
commissioner, reaffirmed that the Commission was fully committed to the
setting of minimum social standards across the EC. 'The social dimension (of
EC policy) is up and running,' said Mr Flynn, who denied that Britain was
gaining any economic advantage by opting out of the social protocol of the
Maastricht treaty.
The EC-wide 'framework for employment', agreed by the Commission at its
meeting in Strasbourg, aims to improve the Community's comparatively poor
record on employment. Mr Flynn pointed out that only 60 per cent of the EC
workforce was employed, against 70-75 per cent in Japanese, US or
Scandinavian economies. He said economic growth alone would not be enough to
reduce the 17.4m EC jobless total. He said 9m jobs were created in the EC by
the booming economy of the mid-1980s, but unemployment fell only 3m.
The Commission proposes that member states should co-ordinate action, for
example by encouraging employees to adapt to different types of job and
practices - such as job-sharing - and 'investigating the scope for reducing
labour costs'.
