FT  28 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia makes further cut in
harvest estimate

RUSSIA'S DEPUTY agriculture minister yesterday revealed a further cut in the
republic's 1992 grain harvest estimate, reports Reuter from Moscow.
'Ministry of Agriculture experts believe that grain production will total
93m-94m tonnes,' Mr Vladimir Shcherbak told a news conference. Initial
estimates had put the crop total at between 104m and 108m tonnes, but that
was cut to 98m tonnes two and a half weeks ago and subsequently to 96m
tonnes. According to Russian statistics the 1991 harvest was 89.1m tonnes.
Mr Shcherbak blamed shortages of oil and lack of equipment and spare parts -
traditional problems in the troubled agricultural sector - for the
disappointing production figures, which in turn force reliance on expensive
imports.
The London-based International Wheat Council expects Russia to import 19m
tonnes of wheat and coarse grains in the 1992-93 season ending June 30,
after 36.3m the previous year.
Last week Russian President Boris Yeltsin told citizens in the Siberian city
of Omsk that he expected grain imports to total 10m tonnes in the coming
year, after 25m this year.
