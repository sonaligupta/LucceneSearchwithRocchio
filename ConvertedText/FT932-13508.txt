UKRAINE'S parliament yesterday revived fears of a resurgence of nuclear
tension in eastern Europe when it put the country's non-nuclear commitment
into question, Oleg Mamayev writes from Kiev.
In a closed session, the MPs changed a key clause in a draft on military
doctrine which read that Ukraine would in future become a non-nuclear state
to read that nuclear weapons would stay on its territory for a 'transitional
period', according to deputies after the session last night.
