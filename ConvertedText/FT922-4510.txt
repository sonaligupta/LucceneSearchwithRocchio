FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Possibly a coincidence


   From Prof GERALD MARS


Sir, Could the present talk about a government bail out of Lloyd's Names
have anything to do with the fact that bankrupts cannot serve as MPs? At
least 30 Tory MPs are likely to become bankrupt and, as far as I recall, the
government's majority is only 21.
