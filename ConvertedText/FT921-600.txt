FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Insurance for pensions a non-starter


   From Mr A P BENSON


Sir, James Carty (Letters, March 26) rather misses the mark when he suggests
that pension fund managers should have insurance cover (presumably against
the risks of professional negligence and fidelity) equal at least to the
total level of funds which they have under management.
He cites the case of fund managers controlling assets of Pounds 27bn and
having some unspecified form of cover for Pounds 50m. Premiums necessarily
charged by insurers do not solely relate to their perception of the
probability of their being called upon to pay claims. Part of any premium is
paid for the commitment of an insurer's financial capacity (ie his
solvency), and in the example used by Mr Carty this premium element alone
would produce a considerable cost.
Additionally, and bearing in mind the relatively low asset bases of most
insurers today, it would be imprudent of any insurance buyer to over-expose
himself to any single insurer. If in this field a buyer decided that it was
prudent to place no more than Pounds 25m of cover with any one insurance
carrier it would be necessary to put together a panel of more than 1,000
insurers to provide coverage to the level which Mr Carty proposes. The
frictional or overhead costs of creating such an arrangement would be
massive indeed.
In short, insurance to such levels of indemnity is a non-starter. The more
sensible and less costly procedure would be to control the fundamental risk
by the imposition of statutory requirements relating to the roles both of
trustees and of fund managers, coupled with a requirement for relatively
modest compulsory insurance to provide basic protection against some,
although certainly not all, of the inevitable risks inherent in the
investment management process.
