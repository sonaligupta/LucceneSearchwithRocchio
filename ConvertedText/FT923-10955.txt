FT  28 JUL 92 / Observer: Indigestion?


As if the prime minister didn't have enough on his plate, yesterday's tasks
included doing the seating plan for a dinner to mark the 40th anniversary of
the Queen's accession to the throne.
The hosts were all her surviving prime ministers (with the exception of Lord
Home, who was unable to travel from Scotland) and the guests were members of
the Royal Family and household.
For starters, where do you put the Prince and Princess of Wales, or Sir
Edward Heath and Lady Thatcher? And in these post-Maastricht days, would it
be right to put Lady Thatcher on the left of John Major?
Sea bass and summer pudding were on the menu, but like all the best parties
the key to success is getting the seating plan right.
Let's hope it was another diplomatic triumph for the prime minister.
