FT  11 APR 92 / CIS energy talks collapse


   By ANDREW HILL


   BRUSSELS


Talks on the signing of a multilateral treaty to help the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and east European states exploit their energy
resources have been suspended until June because of the inability of CIS
members to commit themselves to the agreement, writes Andrew Hill in
Brussels. The treaty will underpin the European energy charter, a political
declaration which was signed in December by nearly 50 states, including
European Community members, the US and Japan. The charter aims to encourage
investment, and aid regeneration of the east and central European economies.
