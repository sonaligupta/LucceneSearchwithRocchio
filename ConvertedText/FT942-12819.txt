FT  28 APR 94 / French parties in Euro alliance

Gaullist Euro-MPs are to join their French UDF allies in allying themselves
with the Christian Democrat European Peoples Party (EPP) in the Strasbourg
Parliament, as a consequence of the two parties' decision to present a
single list of candidates and policies in the June Euro-elections. This is
an historic switch for the RPR Gaullists, who up to now in Strasbourg have
sat with a ragbag of other conservative nationalists, mainly Irish Fianna
Fail deputies. But at the UDF's urging, the RPR has now followed the British
Conservatives in overcoming their dislike of the religious and federalist
overtones of the Christian Democrat grouping.
An RPR spokesman yesterday denied his party's switch in Strasbourg signalled
any move towards an eventual merger between Gaullists and the centre-right
UDF in domestic politics. Nevertheless, their Euro-unity appears to be
paying off. An opinion poll published yesterday put support for the RPR-UDF
list at 38 per cent, well ahead of the Socialists at 18.5 per cent.
