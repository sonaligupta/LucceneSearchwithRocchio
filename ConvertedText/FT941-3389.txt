FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering leaps to Pounds 8.6m and
lifts dividend


   By ANDREW BAXTER


Hall Engineering (Holdings) yesterday announced a sharp rise in 1993 pre-tax
profits from a restated Pounds 2.36m to Pounds 8.56m and is raising its
dividend for the year by 10 per cent to 9.5p, with a final of 3.02p.
The Shrewsbury-based metal stockholding, steel products and automotive
engineering group benefited from higher margins in its steel reinforcement
business, especially in the first half, the completion of its UK
rationalisation and another rise in profits from associated companies in the
Pacific Rim.
Pre-tax profits for 1992 have been restated for FRS 3, and would have been
Pounds 5.6m on a pre-FRS 3 and pre-exceptional cost basis.
Sales last year rose 8 per cent from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 146m, and also
by 8 per cent, to Pounds 182m, if share of associates' sales is included.
Earnings per share rose to 19.18p, against 3.05p in 1992 when there was a
loss per share of 1.67p under the basic calculation including exceptional
items.
In metal stockholding, losses were cut by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 183,000,
while the steel reinforcement business turned a Pounds 1.5m loss into a
Pounds 62,000 profit.
Profits in the engineering division fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 3.2m, due
mainly to reduced profits and redundancy costs in Stadco's pressings
division. Profits in the automation division were slightly ahead.
Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said the takeover of Rover by BMW could help
Stadco win business for the first time from the German car group, and
Stadco's recently-announced joint venture with Honda Engineering would not
be affected.
On the outlook, Mr Hall said he would be very disappointed if the company
could not further improve profits slightly this year. In some businesses,
confidence is much higher than at the same time last year, although others
are still indirectly affected by the recession in continental Europe.
