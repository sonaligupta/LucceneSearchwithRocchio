FT  01 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Safeway's own brand helps cola sales rise
20%


   By NEIL BUCKLEY


Sir Alistair Grant, above, chairman of the Argyll food retailing group, said
yesterday the launch of his Safeway chain's Select Cola had increased its
own-label cola sales nine-fold, and its total cola sales by 20 per cent,
writes Neil Buckley.
Speaking in the week Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola went on sale, adding
to the challenge to market leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Sir Alistair said
the success of own-label colas demonstrated the positive impact own-brand
product launches could still have on retailers' businesses.
The proportion of Safeway's sales accounted for by own-label increased from
39 per cent to 41 per cent in the most recent half-year, helped by the
launch of Safeway Savers, a cut-price range aimed at countering competition
from discounters.
