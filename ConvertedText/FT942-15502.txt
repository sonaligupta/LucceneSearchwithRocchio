FT  14 APR 94 / People: Lee moves team at Hollas


Julian Lee, chief executive of Manchester-based clothing and textiles
company the Hollas group, has moved relatively fast in ushering in some
senior managerial changes since he taking over the helm in November 1993.
Yesterday the group announced several senior personnel moves. It firms up
City belief that Lee intends steering the group into bigger waters,
following a March rights issue raising Pounds 17.3m, doubling the size of
the company.
That issue was used to acquire two companies - Textilion, a maker of ladies'
wear, knitwear and children's clothing, and JB Hunter, holding company of
Edward Macbean, which specialises in making clothing for foul weather.
Textilion's customers include Marks and Spencer, Next and Boots; Gardner
supplies BHS and Woolworths amongst others.
The newly expanded group is now to be split into two divisions - garments
and personal protective clothing - each led by a divisional managing
director. Peter Boyd, chief executive of the subsidiary Textilion, will led
the garments division while Jim Hunter, chief executive of JB Hunter will
take responsibility for personal protective clothing.
At the same time Bryan Hewson, who recently left Alexon, has been appointed
managing director of ladies' and children's wear at Textilion; Neil Bostock
remains managing director of Textilion's knitwear business. Clive Westbrook
becomes financial controller for the overall Hollas group, and Bill Coll
joins another subsidiary, Gardner, as finance director.
Lee presided, in 1990, over the highly successful sale of Bricom, a
two-year-old MBO from British Commonwealth.
