FT  04 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Peter Black steps out with rise to Pounds
9m


   By CATHERINE MILTON


PETER BLACK, the shoes and cosmetics company which supplies Marks and
Spencer, is recommending a 26 per cent lift in its dividend on the back of a
40 per cent surge in pre-tax profits for the year to June 5.
Turnover rose to Pounds 114.9m (Pounds 106.2m) and operating margins to 8.4
per cent (7.7 per cent). The pre-tax profit was Pounds 9.08m (Pounds 6.47m).
According to Mr Stephen Lister, finance director, the results reflected a
strong second half as well as the benefits of recent closures and
cost-cutting: 'We've always said the earnings would come through when that
was completed.'
Mr Gordon Black, joint chairman, said the group was now favourably
positioned, with growth in overall demand for products and in main
customers' share of the market.'
Cosmetics contributed Pounds 40.9m (Pounds 38.2m) to sales and Pounds 4.4m
(Pounds 3.2m) to pre-tax profits; footwear and accessories turned over
Pounds 60.6m (Pounds 55.9m) and made Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 2.5m).
The small, cash generative distribution and leisure businesses contributed
Pounds 13.4m (Pounds 12.1m) to turnover and Pounds 1m (Pounds 800,000) to
profits.
Borrowings fell to Pounds 1m (Pounds 5.5m) giving gearing of 2 per cent (15
per cent). Interest costs fell to Pounds 614,000 (Pounds 1.73m).
A final dividend of 2.77p makes a 3.7p (2.94p) total. Earnings rose to
11.18p (7.92p) per share.
COMMENT
Gordon Black thinks his shoes and cosmetics are recession-proof. Certainly,
that is the case when Marks and Spencer, which buys 65 per cent of Black's
turnover, is the customer. M&S has increased its market share in shoes over
the last five years. Black is now trying to make the same headway in
continental Europe during a consumer recession, relying on a wider customer
base than at home. With most of the impact of cost cutting already reflected
in profits, growth this year will be more modest. Pre-tax profits are likely
only to match 1990's peak of Pounds 10.3m. Earnings of under 13p give a
multiple of almost 16 which is a fair rating until bigger Continental
profits are proven.
