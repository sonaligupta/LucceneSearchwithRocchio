FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore tumbles into the red


Along with a confession over the efficacy of his economic forecasting, Mr
Grenville Dean, chairman of Merivale Moore, the property investment and
development group, revealed that his company had fallen into the red in the
six months to December 31.
He recalled that in September he had said that the property slump appeared
to 'be on its last legs', but the fall from profits of Pounds 1.84m to
pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.43m had disproved his words. Turnover plunged to
Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 43.2m).
Mr Dean added that the pace of business had been 'witheringly slow'.
Total income amounted to Pounds 4.28m (Pounds 8.7m), but interest charges
were down at Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 5.18m). Net debt at the year-end stood at
Pounds 66.7m, inflated by September's Pounds 20m acquisition in London's St
John's Wood. It was expected to fall to about Pounds 35m by June 1992 after
anticipated residential and commercial sales of about Pounds 30m.
Losses totalled 7p (earnings 8.7p) and the interim dividend is reduced from
2.75p to 1p.
