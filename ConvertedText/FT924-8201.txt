FT  12 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals


Third quarter results from Astra of Sweden yesterday are a reminder that it
is fast catching up with the giants in ulcer treatment. Around two-thirds of
Glaxo's profits come from Zantac, its market-leading ulcer drug, and
SmithKline Beecham plays a profitable second fiddle. Little wonder the
market is asking how the Pounds 5bn sector will be carved up later this
decade.
While Astra is gaining ground in Europe, it has yet to convince the US
regulators its drug is safe for a wide range of applications. With 10
similar approvals in Europe this is surely only a matter of time. SmithKline
loses its US patent in 1994. With the extra mass created by the merger, it
can ride out the decline. But cheap generic competition would be bad news
for Glaxo. More importantly, Glaxo must defend Zantac's patent in the US
courts. If it fails, sales will slump from 1995 when the current patent
expires. The next generation of ulcer drugs is promising enough, but Glaxo
is hardly likely to have them ready in time.
If the patent can be defended, the company should have enough fire-power in
ulcer treatment and elsewhere to maintain a more than respectable rate of
growth. With prospects elsewhere so bleak, Glaxo does not look unduly
expensive even on a multiple of 20 times next year's forecast earnings. On a
prospective multiple of 18 and with a growing international following,
though, Astra is starting to look cheap.
