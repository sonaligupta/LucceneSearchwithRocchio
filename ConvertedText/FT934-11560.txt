FT  30 OCT 93 / Markets: Two more equity bonds launched - At a glance


Two more guaranteed equity bonds have been launched. Bristol & West's fourth
issue allows investors to put up to 50 per cent of their money in a one-year
interest paying account paying 7.5 per cent gross. The rest goes into a bond
which will match the capital performance of the FT-SE 100 Index over five
years, with guaranteed return of capital. Scottish Amicable's fourth issue
gives investors the benefit of reinvested dividend income on top of the
FT-SE 100's rise.
