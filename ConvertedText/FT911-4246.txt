FT  20 APR 91 / UK Company News: Microvitec speaks for 21% of Logitek


   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO


Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer peripherals manufacturer, intensified
its pressure on Logitek, the computer services company for which it has
launched a hostile bid, by announcing that, at the first closing date, it
controls 20.7 per cent of its target, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Microvitec said that it was 'greatly encouraged' by the level of
acceptances, exceptionally high for this stage of a bid. It has extended the
1-for-1 share offer until April 25. The offer values the company at Pounds
3.3m.
Logitek said, however, that 'this low level of acceptances demonstrates that
the vast majority of shareholders agree that Microvitec's offer is
misconceived and inadequate.'
