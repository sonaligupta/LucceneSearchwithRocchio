FT  22 OCT 94 / New airline seeks to keep out BA


British Mediterranean Airways, a newly established airline which plans to
launch a daily London-Beirut service on October 28, yesterday sought to have
British Airways barred from operating on this route for two years.
BMA told a Civil Aviation Authority hearing that BA's plans to launch a
London Heathrow to Amman service via Beirut was intended to undermine the
economics of BMA at the start-up.
