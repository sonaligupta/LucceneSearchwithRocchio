FT  21 NOV 92 / Call for terror insurance


   By RICHARD LAPPER


THE GOVERNMENT may come under pressure next week to help provide business
with financial protection against terrorist attack, in the wake of last
week's announcement by the Association of British Insurers that terrorism
might be excluded from commercial insurance policies.
The ABI, the industry's trade association, earlier this month issued its
members with a model insurance policy wording excluding terrorism.
Few companies are prepared to comment, but a number are known to be
concerned about facing possible losses from terrorism without insurance
cover.
At a meeting on Monday the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers in
Industry and Commerce (Airmic), which represents buyers at more than 300
leading British companies, will voice industry's concerns with
representatives of the CBI and the ABI.
Mr John Greenway, the Conservative MP for Ryedale, the chairman of the
all-party insurance and financial services committee, is also expected to
meet Airmic on Monday.
He wrote earlier this week to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, suggesting that the government could help provide reinsurance to
allow insurers to continue to cover terrorism.
Mr Tony Baker, head of public relations at the ABI, said without reinsurance
UK insurers could offer only up to Pounds 600m of cover, compared with
potential demand of Pounds 240bn.
