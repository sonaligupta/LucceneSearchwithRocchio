FT  06 AUG 93 / UK Company News: John I Jacobs at Pounds 46,000 midway


JOHN I Jacobs, the shipowning and shipbroking group, announced pre-tax
profits of Pounds 46,000 for the half year ended June 30.
The comparable outcome has been restated in accordance with FRS 3 and
accordingly the Pounds 3.85m achieved on the disposal of Jacobs Offshore has
been included in the pre-tax figure of Pounds 3.44m.
The Directors said that the broking departments had achieved increased
levels of activity and there were indications that the improvement would be
more than sustained during the second half.
The coaster fleet achieved better results than in the second half of 1992,
they said.
It was unlikely that the group would have to commit any further new cash
resources to the shipowning activity.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.13m) and operating profits came
out at Pounds 125,000 against losses of Pounds 110,000.
There were earnings per share of 0.5p (11.5p) and a maintained interim
dividend of 0.5p is declared.
