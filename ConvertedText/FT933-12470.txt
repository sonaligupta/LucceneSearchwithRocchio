LOTUS Development, the US personal computer software company, reported a net
loss for the second quarter after charges for the cost of acquiring a
data-base software company.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 4.7m, or 11 cents a share, compared
with net income of Dollars 14.9m, or 34 cents, in last year's corresponding
quarter.
During the quarter, Lotus completed the acquisition of Approach Software, a
privately held software developer. A substantial portion of the cost,
Dollars 19.9m, was recorded as a charge against second quarter earnings,
Before the charge, net income was Dollars 15.2m, or 35 cents a share.
Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.8m, up 7 per cent from Dollars
220.3m last time.
For the year to date Lotus reported net income of Dollars 7.6m, or 18 cents
a share, compared with net income of Dollars 35.7m, or 81 cents, in the
first half of 1992. Before the acquisition charge, net income from
operations for the 1993 half year was Dollars 27.5m, or 64 cents, a 23 per
cent decline.
Revenues for the six-month period increased 3 per cent to Dollars 462.8m
from Dollars 447.4m.
'Results for the quarter exceeded our expectations,' said Mr Jim Manzi,
president and chief executive. 'The strong increase in our Windows
applications sales, for example, more than offset the decline in revenue
from our DOS products.
'The second quarter was one of the most significant in our company's
history,' he added.
