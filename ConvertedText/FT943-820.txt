FT  27 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Washington meeting worries
weigh on bourses


   By Our Markets Staff


Worries about the outcome of today's Federal Open Market Committee meeting
in Washington continued to weigh upon senior bourses, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT blamed the FOMC prospect as the Dax index dropped 21.45 to
2,068.67 on the session, but some brokers injected political apprehension as
the Ibis-indicated index fell further to 2,057.83 by the end of the
afternoon, down 1.9 per cent from last Friday's post-bourse close.
Turnover fell from DM5.7bn to DM5.3bn. On the session, Daimler lost DM13.50
at DM772 after last Friday's Standard & Poor's downgrading of its debt; and
Deutsche Bank dropped DM14.50 to DM692.50 on US selling on its involvement
with Metallgesellschaft as one of the embattled trading group's major
banking shareholders.
Metallgesellschaft fell DM15.80 to DM133.20 and hit a new 1994 intraday low
of DM122 after hours before closing the afternoon at DM130, as stories
circulated that Deutsche Bank and other major banking shareholders were
reducing their positions.
The afternoon also brought a reaction from Siemens, down DM15.50 to DM647.70
at the close of Ibis trading, after a magazine article said the giant
electricals group would report slightly lower profits this year; Siemens
said the report contained errors.
PARIS fielded a number of corporate features as the general market fell on
interest rate worries in a gloomy opening to the new account. The CAC 40
index lost 24.63, or 1.3 per cent, at 1,902.72 after a low of 1,895.62 for
the day.
Turnover was FFr2.6bn. The best features were in leaders such as Peugeot,
down just FFr2 to FFr793 before news after market hours of a return to
profitability, and Societe Generale, expected to reveal higher profits today
and FFr1 up at FFr536.
At the more painful end of the performance charts, Eurotunnel dropped
FFr1.45, or 6.4 per cent, to FFr21.10 on reports of water leaks in the
tunnel, although the company said this was a normal occurrence; and Credit
Lyonnais, opening strongly at FFr415 on hopes of state aid, fell to FFr378
before closing FFr8.20 lower at FFr387 as those hopes were denied. The bank
will produce its delayed first-half results this afternoon.
AMSTERDAM was lower on interest rate worries and the AEX index closed 3.14
down at 400.47. Unilever bucked the trend, however, picking up 60 cents at
Fl 194.50 amid optimism over forthcoming third-quarter results.
A 30-cent advance in Aegon to Fl 101.70 was attributed to strong interest in
its call options on the EOE. ABN-Amro fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 57 and ING 90 cents
to Fl 74.80.
KLM ended 20 cents higher at Fl 47.60 after its deputy chairman said the
airline would seek to strengthen existing co-operation arrangements.
Heineken dipped Fl 1.70 to Fl 236.30: Kleinwort Benson, which continues to
rate the stock a buy after the higher than expected first-half results, said
the brewer was its preferred defensive play, along with CSM.
ZURICH finished lower in thin volume, the SMI index losing 23.0 at 2,586.1,
with many investors unwilling to commit themselves.
Roche certificates set the tone with a SFr70 loss to SFr5,955 while Nestle
gave up SFr14 to SFr1,191, and Sulzer fell SFr20 to SFr890 ahead of today's
first-half results.
Financials were broadly easier. Swiss Re fell SFr4 to SFr567. Among the
banks, SBC lost SFr5 to SFr367 and CS Holding fell SFr9 to SFr538.
MILAN edged ahead on a day of highly charged political debate and the Comit
index rose 3.95 to 672.14 as Friday's deadline approached for the government
to present its budget plans.
However, Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa Sim in Milan noted that business was
light, with continuing delays and the postponement of yesterday morning's
meeting between the government and unions on pensions reform adding to
investors' worries about the eventual effectiveness of the budget proposals.
The small gain in the index was largely attributed to advances in telecom
stocks, particularly that of Stet, which rose L114 to L4,621 on arbitrage
activity ahead of the expiration of the warrants on its savings shares.
Telecom Italia gained L101 at L4,325: the group is expected to report
buoyant first-half figures today.
Six-month results continued to feature. Pirelli rose to a high of L2,660 in
reply to Friday's better than expected first-half figures before ending L27
down at L2,610. Fiat was off L9 at L6,692, after touching L6,745, ahead of
Thursday's figures.
MADRID reversed an early improvement to close with the general index 1.65
easier at 297.17.
Repsol was one of the few winners on the day, gaining a token Pta10 at
Pta3,825 on news that the equity offer forming the third stage of the oil
major's privatisation could be delayed until next year.
