FT  27 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Correction


THERE WAS an error in the reply 'Miras on two homes' given last week. The
correct reply is as follows: As a married couple, you and your husband can
receive mortgage interest tax relief on only one property even if the house
is your main residence and the flat is his main residence. It makes no
difference whose names the properties are in. Usually where a married couple
own two properties, one of them will be their joint main residence (in your
case probably the house). If in fact you and your husband will have separate
main residences, the one you bought first will be treated as your joint main
residence for mortgage interest relief purposes.
This tie-breaker rule to which this refers is at Section 356B(5) ICTA 1988.
