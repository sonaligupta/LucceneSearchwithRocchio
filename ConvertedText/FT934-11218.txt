FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Firms fail to benefit
from single market - In a Nutshell


The European single market appears to have been a non-event for most small
and medium-sized UK manufacturing businesses. According to Pera
International, the management and technology consultant, 70 per cent of
those interviewed for a survey* said they had derived no business benefits
since borders were formally removed on 1 January 1993.
The research demonstrates that British reluctance to exploit new
opportunities stems from continued export difficulties, additional expenses
and the effects of the recession. Less than half of all UK respondents found
transportation or paperwork easier since the start of this year; one quarter
stressed the difficulty of meeting new EC technical quality standards.
