FT  27 MAR 92 / Observer: Recovering well


Peter Jacobs, the old British Sugar hand now stirring things up as Bupa's
chief executive, is delivering on his pledge to make the private health
group more commercial while keep- ing its compassionate image.
On Monday he reported that Bupa had turned a Pounds 38.2m deficit into a
Pounds 1.3m surplus last year. Yesterday, he introduced the compassionate
image in the form of Sir Bryan Nicholson, the Post Office chairman and chief
executive, who is to succeed Lord Wigoder as Bupa's chairman.
Nicholson came to public prominence as chairman of the then Manpower
Services Commission in 1984 - he was knighted for his services there when he
left in 1987 - and his work on unemployment and training schemes revealed
him as a businessman with a strong social conscience. He still chairs the
National Council for Vocational Qualifications and the CBI's education and
training committee.
No doubt Jacobs will be keen to take advantage of Nicholson's business
exper-
ience as well as his reputation for compassion. The private health care
market is even more cut-throat than the new, commercial NHS, and Bupa's
market-leadership is under increasingly heavy attack.
