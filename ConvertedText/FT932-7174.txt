FT  25 MAY 93 / International Company News: Fondiaria to sell stake in Epic
arm

FONDIARIA, the Italian insurance group which is expected to announce heavy
losses later this week, is to sell for DM170.9m (Dollars 105m) its one-third
stake in the Epic insurance partnership.
Epic (European Partners for Insurance Co-operation) was set up in February
1992 by Fondiaria, Royal Insurance of the UK and Germany's Aachener und
Munchener Beteiligungs as a step towards European insurance co-operation.
While each company decided to maintain its independ-ence, European expansion
outside their home countries was to have been co-ordinat-ed.
Under the terms of Epic's creation, the stake has to be bought by AMB should
Royal not buy it first. Epic's main activity is Royal's former Dutch
business, and various other European business ceded by the three partners.
The latest move follows Fondiaria's DM985m sale this month of its 21 per
cent stake in AMB to a group of German institutions.
As with the AMB shares, Fondiaria's Epic stake, held by its Latina
subsidiary, will officially change hands only at the end of May 1994. The
Italian company is likely to use a bank intermediary to receive the cash
earlier to cut debts.
Fondiaria and AMB will also unscramble two remaining financial transactions,
with Fondiaria selling AMB its 30 per cent stake in AMFO, the former
Fondiaria Verwaltungs, for DM198m.
