FT  16 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BA separates out engineering side


   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent


British Airways is setting up its engineering activities as a separate
profit centre next month in an effort to reduce the airline's overall
aircraft maintenance and engineering costs, as well as expand engineering
services to other carriers.
The engineering and aircraft maintenance activities employ about 10,000
people out of BA's total 50,000 strong workforce and include facilities at
London's Heathrow airport and in Wales, where BA overhauls Boeing 747 jumbo
airliners and recently opened an aircraft avionics repair and maintenance
centre.
The engineering activities headed by Mr Alistair Cumming are also expected
to be strengthened by imminent management changes to boost the company's
engineering management team.
BA's engineering operations have seen significant growth over the last three
years. The company, which outlined yesterday its plans to its unions to
transform the engineering business from a cost centre into a profit centre,
sees strong potential for further growth in aircraft maintenance and
engineering services.
Already about 15 per cent of BA's overall engineering activities involves
work for other carriers and the airline hopes to develop this third party
business through its latest reorganisation.
