FT  21 NOV 92 / Briefcase, Q&A: Refund on a Tessa


I AM unemployed and have a Tessa which I propose cashing in to supplement
funds and which will, therefore, earn net interest only from inception. As
my earnings last tax year (and most likely this as well) fall short of my
individual tax allowance, will I be able to obtain a refund from the Revenue
after April 5 which will effectively restore the status quo and give me
gross interest, even though I am only two years into the contract?
If your total income for 1992-93 is below the tax limit, the tax on your
Tessa interest will be refunded. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets
IR41 (Income Tax and the Unemployed), IR111 (How to Claim a Repayment of Tax
on Bank and Building Society Interest), and IR114 (Tessa - Tax-free Interest
for Taxpayers).
