FT  16 MAR 94 / Air bubbles join war on oil spills


   By ROBERT CORZINE


Air bubbles have become the latest weapon in the battle to contain small oil
spills from tankers, Robert Corzine writes. Shell has installed a
bubble-based containment system - shown in use above - at its Stanlow
manufacturing centre at Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. A wall of bubbles
released from hundreds of small holes in hoses anchored to the bottom of the
Manchester Ship Canal is strong enough to confine minor spills of oil or
chemicals, giving crews time to activate more substantial containment
systems, such as inflatable booms. The system was tested by the Royal Navy
at Plymouth
