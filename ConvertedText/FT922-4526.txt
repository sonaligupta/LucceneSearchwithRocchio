FT  05 JUN 92 / People: Leaving the tracks early


Gordon Pettitt, managing director of BRITISH RAIL's Regional Railways
sector, surprised the transport community yesterday by announcing that he
was to retire in August after just two years in the job.
The imminent denationalisation of the railways appears to be the main
motivation behind his decision. As he explained yesterday, at 58 he is only
two years away from BR's compulsory retirement age. If he had stayed on in
the job, his departure would have come in the middle of what threatens to be
the biggest reorganisation in BR's history.
'I felt it would be better for the business to be led by someone who can
take Regional Railways through all the developments that will come in the
next few years,' he said. 'It is important for the staff to have
continuity.'
Pettitt, a railwayman all his working life, will be succeeded by Jim
Cornell, whose present title is director, technical standards. Aged 52, Mr
Cornell joined BR in 1959 as a student civil engineer and worked his way up
through the engineering side of the railway until he became deputy general
manager of ScotRail in 1984, and then general manager in 1986.
He was appointed BR's director of civil engineering in 1988, where he
undertook a review of infrastructure costs before he was made director,
technical standards, in BR's recent reorganisation.
Cornell, in turn, will be succeeded by Ken Burrage, director of signals &
telecommunications engineering.
