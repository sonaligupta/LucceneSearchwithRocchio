FT  23 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Astonishment over rate cuts


   By JAMES BLITZ


THE DOLLAR and leading European currencies performed strongly against the
D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank astonished dealers by lowering the
effective floor to German money market rates, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to reduce its Lombard rate by 50 basis points to
8.50 per cent had been anticipated by some marketmakers. But the cut in the
discount rate - from 7.50 per cent to 7.25 per cent - took almost the whole
market by surprise.
The shock was all the greater because agencies originally reported that
there was no change in Bundesbank rates, and only corrected their news
flashes three minutes later. One dealer talked of substantial gains and
losses in dollar/D-Mark trading in the intervening period.
The cut in rates helped the dollar rise in the European afternoon to peak at
DM1.6135, although it later slipped to end only slightly up on the day at
DM1.6065. The dollar's modest rise was surprising, considering that this was
the third easing in official German rates in 10 weeks. However, the US
currency remains capped by the 4 percentage-point differential between
short-term US and German rates. In New York trading it fell a pfennig to end
at DM1.5965.
The impact of the Bundesbank's move was felt far more keenly inside the
European exchange rate mechanism.
In the European morning, both the French franc and the Spanish peseta had
come under pressure on expectations that the Bundesbank would leave policy
unchanged at its council meeting.
The French franc weakened beyond the FFr3.38 level against the D-Mark for
the first time in some weeks. The peseta also declined sharply, bottoming
out at Pta72.78 to the D-Mark, forcing the Bank of Spain to raise its daily
intervention rate by 65 basis points to 14.0 per cent and to intervene in
the market by buying its currency.
The German discount rate cut helped the franc in afternoon trading to a
close of FFr3.374 per D-Mark. But the peseta remained weak, closing at
Pta72.54 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta72.37. It was some 74 basis points
above the weakest currency in the ERM grid last night, a full percentage
point below its level of 10 days ago.
Both the Bundesbank move and the UK unemployment figures helped sterling to
close at DM2.4875 against the D-Mark, 2 1/4 pfennigs ahead on the day. The
currency rose a striking 0.8 percentage points against its exchange rate
index to end at 80.7.
The drop in seasonally adjusted unemployment by 26,000 took the markets by
surprise, and underlined the views of those who think the UK economy may be
in the midst of an upturn. Mr David Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in
London, believes the critical level for the pound is DM2.49: 'If it breaks
through that, we should see DM2.52.'
