FT  28 JAN 94 / Spanish strike 'backed by 8m'


   By PETER BRUCE


   MADRID


Spanish riot police clashed with pickets across the country yesterday as
trade unions staged a 24-hour strike in protest at the government's plans to
reform the labour market.
The unions claimed that 8m workers took part in the stoppage but employers
insisted that some 70 per cent of businesses operated normally.
The government was maintaining a low profile, however, as it became
increasingly clear that the strike had failed to have as serious an impact
as expected outside the heavily industrialised areas.
Clashes between strikers and police took place in Madrid and the cities of
Burgos, Malaga, Zaragoza, and San Sebastian. One person was killed when a
car was driven into a picket line and dozens were injured in clashes. More
than 100 strikers were arrested. Traffic in Spain's large cities fell off as
many people preferred to take a day off rather than face hundreds of pickets
spread about the country by the two main Spanish unions, the General
Workers' Union and the Workers' Commissions.
But the government appeared to have been able to guarantee minimum public
transport services in most cities and the prime minister, Mr Felipe
Gonzalez, now seems likely to offer only token recognition to the strikers
in the next few days. This will probably take the form of a government
statement applauding the lack of serious violence.
It is likely the lower than expected impact of the strike means the
government will stick to its resolve not to renegotiate the reforms.
