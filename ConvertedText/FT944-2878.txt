FT  15 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Funds return to LME - Market
Report


   By REUTER


Base metals prices at the London Metal Exchange had a generally steadier day
as investment fund buying was attracted by recent lower levels in some
metals. There was also some trade buying and bargain hunting.
Persistent fund buying of NICKEL saw the three months delivery price soar by
around Dollars 300 at one stage before it ended at Dollars 8,450, up Dollars
275.
Three months COPPER traded actively around the Dollars 2,900-a-tonne level
for most of the day until buyers gained the upper hand late in the day,
taking the price to a close of Dollars 2,912, up Dollars 6.
Renewed speculative buying and short-covering helped lift ALUMINIUM, which
was also affected by talk of power failures in the US north-west, where many
smelters are located.
TIN was subjected to further bouts of hedge selling and liquidation, but
this was well absorbed in the low Dollars 5,800s and a rally ensued.
