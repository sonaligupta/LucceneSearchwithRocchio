FT  27 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Dunedin trusts issue
commercial paper


   By TRACY CORRIGAN


Two UK investment trusts managed by Dunedin Fund Managers have issued
commercial paper for the first time.
The Edinburgh Investment Trust has signed a Pounds 150m programme, while
Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust has signed a Pounds 75m programme,
both arranged by NatWest Capital Markets.
Both will use the proceeds to lower borrowing costs by about 50 basis
points, according to Mr David McCraw, a director of Dunedin Fund Managers.
The proceeds will refinance syndicated loans which have been fully drawn and
invested in the UK gilts market.
'We believe that these programmes with their first class credit ratings are
a highly efficient means of gearing,' Mr McCraw said. The programmes are
rated A1+ by Standard & Poors and P1 by Moody's.
Sumitomo Bank and First Chicago have set up a programme for repackaging
trade receivables of European companies and selling them to US investors, in
the form of asset-backed commercial paper.
So far, Dollars 300m of US commercial paper has been issued through a
conduit administered by First Chicago, but the potential size of the
programme is Dollars 3bn.
Similar programmes already exist. For example, NatWest has a vehicle for
securitising corporate loans, called Thames Funding, which also issues
commercial paper in the US market. However, Sumitomo is believed to be the
first Japanese bank to securitise European assets through the US commercial
paper market. Sumitomo and First Chicago already run a similar programme in
the US market backed by US receivables.
Most of the receivables are originated from investment-grade European
companies or subsidiaries, many of whom are clients of Sumitomo.
