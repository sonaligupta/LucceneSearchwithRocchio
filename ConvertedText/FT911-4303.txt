FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Continental Air considers
reorganisation


   By NIKKI TAIT


CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier caught up in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings since late last year, is considering a reorganisation involving
unsecured creditors of its parent company, Continental Airlines Holdings,
and the main operating business, Continental Airlines, converting into
equity.
It suggested yesterday there was a possibility Continental Airlines
Holdings' interest in its main operating subsidiary could be 'materially
diluted', or even eliminated.
Equally, the holding company said it 'could be deprived of a portion or
possibly all of its ownership interests in each of its non-Continental
subsidiaries pursuant to their separate plans of reorganisation'.
'Continental Airlines Holdings presently anticipates that equity holders
will likely suffer substantial dilution or possibly complete elimination of
their interests,' it said.
Word of the possible reorganisation came in an annual filing by Continental
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Continental stressed, however,
that no decision on a reorganisation had been made.
