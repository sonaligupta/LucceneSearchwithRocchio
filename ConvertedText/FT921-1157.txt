FT  25 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Dunkirk spirit - Ballot Box


Paddy Ashdown's energetic election tour is in danger of becoming a trifle
eccentric. Liberal Democrat strategists are considering adding a brief foray
into northern France on Sunday. The objective would be to stress Liberal
Democrat support for European union - though it would destroy any pretence
that the leader's campaign is about meeting real voters.
Journalists following him, however, are much attracted by the idea. After
flying to all points of the UK in the past 10 days, they are looking forward
to the chance of some duty frees and a decent meal.
