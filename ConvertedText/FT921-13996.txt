FT  17 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US company plans Russian gold
search


   By KENNETH GOODING


CYPRUS MINERALS, the second-largest US copper producer, hopes to be the
first American company to go mining for gold in the newly independent
Republic of Russia, writes Kenneth Gooding.
However, Cyprus says suggestions that its Cyprus Gold subsidiary is ready to
invest Dollars 50m on a joint venture in Russia's main gold producing
region, Magadan in the far east of the Republic, are very wide of the mark.
Mr Michael Rounds, a Cyprus official, said: 'We have been negotiating with
the Russians since October, 1990, but there is still a great deal of work to
be done before we get any agreement. It is certainly much too early to put a
dollar amount on any proposal'.
He was responding to a report by Russia's Interfax news agency quoting Mr
Ilya Rozenblum, president of Geometall, with which Cyprus has been
negotiating.
Mr Rozenblum was quoted as saying a joint venture with Cyprus would re-work
two gold deposits that had not been very profitable when Soviet methods were
used. He said, however, success of the venture would depend on the Russian
government allowing Cyprus to keep 25 to 30 per cent of the gold - but the
agency gave no indication of expected output.
