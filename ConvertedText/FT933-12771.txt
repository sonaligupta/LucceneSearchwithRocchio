FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Renishaw shares fall on profit warning


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


SHARES IN Renishaw, the engineering group that makes specialist measuring
equipment, fell 34p to 240p yesterday after the group warned its profits
would not meet market expectations.
It said pre-tax profits for the year ended June 30 would be 20 to 25 per
cent lower than the maintained Pounds 9m expected by the City.
Germany, France and Japan, its main markets, were still suffering from
worldwide recession. The group relies heavily on selling its measuring
probes to makers and users of the industrialised world's machine tools.
Mr Ben Taylor, assistant chief executive, said Renishaw had also sold
forward some of its export earnings, including most of its D-Marks, just
before sterling was forced out of the ERM last September.
Had this approach not been adopted, devaluation would have allowed
translation gains to draw the sting from the lack of trading recovery in
Japan and Germany.
Renishaw said that while profits would fall below market expectations this
year, there were 'indications of increased activity in the North American
market, growing demand in the UK and indications of substantial potential
demand in the Far East.'
Demand for new products, like its scanning products and microscopes, were
also 'encouraging'.
The group would also benefit this year from sterling's departure from the
ERM.
At the end of June the group realised sales in Germany and Japan
particularly had been softer than expected.
Mr Taylor said margins had also come under some pressure, particularly from
some customers who had promised discounts to their customers and wanted
Renishaw to share some of the pain.
