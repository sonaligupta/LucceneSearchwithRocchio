FT  28 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown to stand firm on Europe


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, last night stressed his
party's commitment to a single European currency and criticised Britain's
delay in joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary
system.
Because Britain was late to join the ERM, 'we were late in the battle
against inflation and under Mr Major and Mr Kinnock, we will be late to join
a single European currency. But join we must,' he told a rally in Leeds.
He is expected to make clear at the weekend that the Liberal Democrats would
insist on a more pro-European stance if they were to form a government with
either Labour or the Tories.
The Liberal Democrat leader will use a trip to Bologne tomorrow, where he
will meet other European Liberal party leaders, to set out his party's
policy on Europe and indicate how he would use any negotiating muscle he has
after April 9 to push for Britain to back a single European currency.
Mr Ashdown also heightened yesterday the priority he would attach to
Scottish devolution in a hung parliament. 'It is inconceivable that we would
agree to a programme for the next parliament which did not include a
commitment to legislate for a Scottish parliament,' he said.
He described Scottish home rule as 'the first step' in the reform of the UK
political system. But he again insisted that law for PR at Westminster
remained the overriding condition for a post-election pact.
His comments at a press conference in Edinburgh came as opinion polls showed
a further slip in Liberal Democrat support in Scotland to 7 per cent
compared with 19 per cent at the 1987 general election.
