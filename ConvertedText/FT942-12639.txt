FT  28 APR 94 / International Company News: Procter & Gamble slips 4%

Procter & Gamble's recently-revealed losses on financial derivatives
resulted in a 4 per cent fall in third-quarter net profits to Dollars 482m
from Dollars 502m, the US consumer products group reported yesterday.
Earlier this month Procter & Gamble said it would be taking a charge of
Dollars 102m against after-tax profits in the latest quarter to close out
two highly-leveraged interest rate swap contracts that turned sour.
Without the charge, which the company described as an unusual item, net
earnings would have risen by 16 per cent to Dollars 584m.
Mr Edwin Artzt, chairman and chief executive, said that the quarter had been
a strong one.
Pre-tax operating profits were up 20 per cent from the comparable period, he
said, partly as a result of cost-cutting measures and partly because the
group had seen solid unit volume gains in the US and double-digit volume
growth internationally.
Last year the group embarked on a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000
jobs to cut costs and defend its brands against competition from low-price
and own-label products.
Sales in the latest quarter improved by only 1 per cent to Dollars 7.44bn
from Dollars 7.35bn. Earnings per share, fully diluted and including the
Dollars 102m charge, fell to 64 cents from 66 cents.
For the nine months to date, sales fell by 1 per cent to Dollars 22.79bn
from Dollars 23.07bn - though the company said if the impact of exchange
rates were excluded, they would have risen by 3 per cent.
Net income for the nine months was Dollars 1.81bn.
Procter & Gamble said comparisons with the previous year's Dollars 563m were
not meaningful because the earlier figure had been restated to reflect
accounting changes.
Underlying earnings, excluding the Dollars 102m charge, had risen by 13 per
cent to Dollars 1.91bn from Dollars 1.69bn and on the same basis, fully
diluted earnings per share had increased to Dollars 2.51 from Dollars 2.22.
