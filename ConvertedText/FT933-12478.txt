FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Sales volumes push Pfizer to 15%
rise in quarter


   By RICHARD WATERS


PFIZER, the US pharmaceuticals group, recorded a 15 per cent rise in
post-tax profits in the second quarter, to Dollars 253.8m. The result was
attributed to higher sales volumes and a net gain of Dollars 27m from
non-recurring items.
A 3 per cent increase in turnover from a year ago, to Dollars 1.75bn, was
driven almost entirely by higher volume, with modest price rises largely
offset by currency factors.
Earnings per share rose to 79 cents a share (73 cents excluding the net gain
from the share sale), up from 66 cents a year ago.
First-half net income of Dollars 582.8m was ahead of the Dollars 234.6m of
the first six months of 1992, which was struck after accounting changes
reduced reported results by Dollars 283m. Pharmaceutical sales at
Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 1 per cent during the second quarter compared with
a year ago. The company blamed the drop on lower sales of its Capoten
cardiovascular drug and government cost-containment measures in Germany and
Italy.
However, sales of consumer healthcare products, medical devices and
nutritional products all rose strongly, resulting in a 3 per cent growth in
sales overall, to Dollars 2.8bn.
Net earnings rose to Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, up from Dollars
488m, or 92 cents a share, in the same period in 1992.
