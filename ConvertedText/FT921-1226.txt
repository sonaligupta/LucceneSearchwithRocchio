FT  25 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium jump 'reporting
error'


   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


FEARS ABOUT a sudden aluminium production surge were allayed yesterday. The
International Primary Aluminium Institute admitted a reporting error had
caused it to report last Friday that daily average output in February had
jumped by 900 tonnes when, in fact, it was unchanged from the January level,
writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent.
Aluminium for delivery in three months had fallen to Dollars 1,290 a tonne
on the London Metal Exchange and seemed set to go lower before the IPAI
statement. Then it recovered to Dollars 1,307.50, unchanged from Monday's
close.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, commented: 'This shakes confidence in
the IPAI. We will be wary until we know the full story'.
Hoogovens, the Netherlands metals group, said it was shelving a Fl 525m
(Pounds 163m) plan to modernise and expand annual capacity at its Delfzijl
smelter from 97,000 to 120,000 tonnes.
