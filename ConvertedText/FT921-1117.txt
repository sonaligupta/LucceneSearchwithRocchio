FT  25 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Decline in car sales helps
push Dow lower

Wall Street
NEWS OF weak mid-March domestic car sales depressed market sentiment
yesterday as investors continued to hold back amid uncertainty about the
short-term direction of share prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 11.18 at 3,260.96. The Standard
& Poor's 500 slipped 1.03 to 408.88, while the Nasdaq composite of
over-the-counter stocks declined 3.15 to 618.68. Turnover on the New York SE
was a moderate 192m shares.
The release of mid-March car sales figures disappointed the market, which
had hoped they would show further evidence of a recovery in consumer
spending. After the biggest manufacturers had reported, it was clear that
the annual selling rate based on the 10-day period earlier this month was
below 6m cars, some way short of the 6.2m rate expected by the market, and
an indication of the continued weakness in consumer demand.
Motor shares were in the limelight following the sales data. General Motors
fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 3/8 after reporting US-made car sales in
mid-March were 6.1 per cent lower than at the same period a year earlier.
Ford dipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 on news of a 5.4 per cent decline
in car sales in the same period, while Chrysler edged Dollars 1/2 lower to
Dollars 17 3/8 on a 26 per cent fall in sales. The one bright spot was a
rise in truck sales over the period for Ford and Chrysler.
K Mart, one of the country's biggest retailers, improved Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 54 after announcing a two-for-one stock split and an increase in
quarterly dividend.
Gap firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 in spite of news that Mr Millard
Drexler, the retail group's president, had sold  1/2 m shares in February
for about Dollars 25.6m. A Gap spokesman said the sale was part of the
normal div-ersification of the president's portfolio.
BancOne rose another Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 as investors continued
to react positively to the regional banking group's Dollars 782m purchase of
Team Bancshares, the sixth largest bank in Texas.
Sterling Chemical rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 4 3/4 on its agreement to
acquire Tenneco's pulp chemicals operations in Canada. Tenneco eased Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 38 3/4 .
SPS Transaction Services appreciated Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 after
broking house Alex Brown & Sons initiated coverage of the recently floated
company with a 'buy' recommendation.
Among over-the-counter stocks, Microsoft weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 127
1/2 after stating that it would be acquiring Fox Software. SunMicrosystems
dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 29 1/2 on the day that the company reduced
prices on its three-dimensional display workstations and its microprocessor
server family of products.
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly lower as the cash flow difficulties at Olympia & York
Developments kept market participants cautious. A trader said: 'That hanging
over us as well as the constitutional (uncertainty) is really killing our
market.'
The composite index finished 5.8 down at 3,437.8. Declines led advances by
323 to 222 after volume of 32.9m shares.
'Obviously they are going to do something to help them (Olympia & York)
restructure. It just puts a big pall over our financial institutions,' the
trader added.
