FT  29 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK flour and bread prices to
rise


   By JOHN BUCKLEY


UK flour and bread prices are expected to rise shortly as a direct
consequence of the quality wheat shortage. Most millers are expected to
announce flour price rises averaging 5 per cent on Monday, writes John
Buckley.
The impact on bread prices may vary between vertically-integrated operations
that combine flour milling and baking, and independent bakers who have to
buy in supplies of flour. However food industry analysts believe the flour
price rise will add up to 4p to the cost of a loaf.
