FT  17 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback for Glaxo


   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


PHARMACEUTICALS group Glaxo saw one of its biggest falls yesterday on
particularly heavy turnover. The shares tumbled sharply in early trading,
with one trader talking of 'complete panic from the word go'. They were down
76 points at one stage following a wave of selling in New York and a
downgrade by one securities house. They recovered to close 50 off at 866p on
14m turnover.
The origins of the slide this week were in heavy US selling of Merck, the
world's biggest drug company, which fell nearly Dollars 3 on Monday and
Dollars 4 on Wednesday. This was the first sign that US investors were
moving out of defensive pharmaceuticals stocks and into cyclicals. The
spotlight turned on Glaxo on Wednesday and, in the US, the American
Depositary Receipts fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 with the equivalent
of 10.4m shares dealt.
Then, in London, County NatWest reduced its forecasts for the company. The
house pharmaceuticals team cut its 1992 estimate by Pounds 67m to Pounds
1,395m and its earnings per share forecast to 32.9p from 34.6p. It said the
cut reflected concerns over currency, Glaxo's anti-asthma treatment Serevent
and growth prospects for its ulcer drug Zantac, which represents about 50
per cent of turnover.
Reports that Roussel-Uclaf, the French medical supply company, is on the
verge of winning approval to sell its Lansoprazole anti-ulcer drug in France
and other western European countries also affected investors attitudes.
Later the US investment house Smith Barney repeated a buy rating on the
entire drug sector and the pressure on the shares eased slightly.
The fall hit other big pharmaceuticals stocks. SmithKline Beecham fell 40 to
923p and Wellcome 16 to 1022p.
ICI in demand
The move into cyclical stocks was of particular benefit to ICI, which jumped
35 to 1222p with 2.6m shares traded, a heavy turnover for the stock.
There was interest from one institutional buyer and this accentuated the
effect of a bear squeeze as traders were caught short of stock by the heavy
overnight US buying.
The rise did not appear to be backed up by any particular company or market
stories although S G Warburg had been bidding for stock and James Capel
discussed the company with clients, pointing out its 'good inherent value'.
TSB firmer
Preliminary figures from TSB, the banking group, showed a lapse into losses
over the past year but were not as bad as some in the market had expected.
They helped the shares to rally strongly from their recent substantial
underperformance against the wider market and the banks sector.
The TSB share price, along with other bank shares, was also boosted by news
that a number of leading building societies had cut their mortgage lending
rates, a move likely to help the dormant UK housing market.
Analysts said there was widespread relief that TSB's figures did not include
any nasty surprises - some observers had expected TSB to record pre-tax
losses of Pounds 85m.
TSB shares, which fell away to 112p in early December, sped to 130p, before
ending a net 8 higher at 128p. Turnover was a hefty 10m shares.
Fisons was brought down by US selling, but was also affected by an article
in a newspaper which claimed to have obtained documents from the US Food and
Drug Administration showing 'the full extent of manufacturing defects' at a
Fisons plant in the UK. In spite of a Fisons rebuttal, the shares lost 6 1/2
to 361p with 12m traded.
Institutions were said to have been heavy buyers of bank stocks after
careful scrutiny of the TSB figures and news of the reductions in mortgage
lending rates. The mortgage moves were viewed as another move to reduce
pressure on borrowers suffering from the twin effects of high interest rates
and recession.
Abbey National, which instigated the latest round of rate cuts, jumped 11 to
295p on keen turnover of 3.4m. Barclays raced higher, closing 17 ahead at
382p on volume of 7.2m, the highest single day's turnover since early
November. Lloyds surged 15 to 400p on 4.2m shares, NatWest 12 to 287p on
8.6m (the busiest day since December 5) and Midland rose 7 to 224p.
Royal outperformed the composite sector, closing 11 higher at 252p on an
emerging stock shortage. Sun Alliance was heavily traded (6.4m) and edged up
3 to 279p, while Guardian Royal attracted sustained support to close 7
higher at 135p.
Excellent new business figures prompted a wave of support for Lloyds Abbey
Life which settled 18 higher at 368p.
The perception of Hanson as a cyclical recovery stock was behind a rise of 4
to 216 1/2 p with 12m traded.
Big dollar earners lost ground yesterday. Reuters fell 25 to 1068p, Reckitt
& Colman dropped 14 to 683p and Unilever lost 10 to 910p.
There was substantial underperformance by BP against the market and the oil
sector, particularly Shell. BP settled 3 1/2 off at 292p on hefty turnover
of 13m and Shell ended up 9 at 503p on 4.3m. A number of big US and UK
institutions were aggressive switchers out of BP and into Shell.
Power generators were among the best performers in the utilities area of the
market with National Power exceptionally strong, ending 7 firmer at 139p on
talk of a James Capel buy recommendation. Turnover in National rose sharply
to 10m. PowerGen added 4 1/2 to 146p on 2.8m. Electricity stocks, however,
were mixed, with profit-takers prompting Northern to lose 11 to 249p.
Guinness was a penny easier at 532p with Smith New Court the latest
securities house to cut its profit estimate. The house is now looking for
Pounds 1,100m this year.
Talk of analysts' downgrades on Forte continued, although there was scant
evidence in the market, leading to suggestions of the possibility of a bear
raid. Kleinwort Benson became the latest broker to be said to have
downgraded, analyst Paul Slattery denying the story, although he added that
Kleinwort is undertaking a major review of the hotels sector. Goldman Sachs
did downgrade yesterday however, shaving around 8 per cent from its profit
forecasts. Forte gained a penny to 231p.
Volume in British Steel rose to 20m in busy trading late in the session, and
the shares gained 7 to 77p on buying from UBS Phillips & Drew, company
brokers, and from the US. UBS now believes British Steel's dividend to be
more secure.
Glynwed International was volatile. The shares retreated in early trading
after UBS Phillips & Drew slashed its 1992 forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds
32m and raised fears about the dividend. However, the shares later recovered
to end only 2 lower at 199p after buying was reported at S G Warburg.
A cut in mortgage interest rates lifted P & O, whose Bovis subsidiary is a
leading UK housebuilder. The shares jumped 21 to 453p.
Investors were cheered by the lack of bad news at Trafalgar House's annual
meeting and the shares responded by adding 4 to 129p. A B Ports gained 6 to
325p on buying at County NatWest.
Vickers closed 5 up at 181p on renewed talk of the imminent part-disposal of
its Rolls Royce Motors subsidiary.
British Land gained 5 to 255p, Land Securities rose 12 to 448p and MEPC
added 8 to 384p.
Worries that Greycoat was having difficulty with its refinancing package for
Embankment Place receded, the shares rebounding 15 to 68p.
BOC Group rose 11 to 646p after a well-received AGM.
