FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cullen's back in black


CULLEN'S Holdings, the grocery retailer, returned profits of Pounds 18,000
pre-tax for the half year ended August 29, compared with previous losses of
Pounds 16,000.
Gross profits rose by Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 381,000. The improvement
reflected a combination of tighter controls on margins and costs in the
Neighbourhood Food Stores division and the elimination of losses connected
with new site developments.
There was also a Pounds 78,000 contribution to profits arising from a
surplus on the sale of properties.
The network gross turnover improved by 15.7 per cent to Pounds 12.6m. The
Neighbourhood Food Stores division increased profitability by 32 per cent.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.1p (losses 0.1p).
