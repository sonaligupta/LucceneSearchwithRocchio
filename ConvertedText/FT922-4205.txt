FT  06 JUN 92 / 'Our Lady' gives up her golden secret - Robin Eggars meets
Herbert Humphreys, a man for whom treasure hunting has become a lifelong
quest that reeks of history, adventure and potentially priceless rewards


   By ROBIN EGGARS


ON THE starless and stormy night of January 4 1656, the Nuestra Senora de
las Maravillas - Our Lady of the Marvels - fired a cannon shot to warn the
rest of its flotilla of approaching sandbanks off the Little Bahama Bank. In
the confusion that followed, the Spanish treasure galleon was rammed by its
sister ship, the Concepcion.
According to Don Diego Portichuelo de Rivadeneryra, a priest on board the
Maravillas: 'The Concepcion gave such a blow to our boom with her cutwater,
which had been newly refitted in Havana and made of mahogany, that it broke
in three pieces. That blow broke through our planks from the top of the
waterline to the holds, making splinters of all of them.'
Impaled from port to starboard, wallowing in heavy seas, the Maravillas'
death throes were swift. The 40 tons of gold and silver bullion and
treasure, destined to fund another of King Philip IV's interminable wars
against France, dragged the 150 ft-long ship on to a coral reef. On deck,
priests were mobbed by crewmen eager to make their last confessions. Some
priests demanded gold and jewels as payment, doubtless hoping to survive and
enjoy Heaven on Earth as well as in the hereafter.
The bow of the Maravillas went down in only 30 ft of water but massive waves
ripped the stern - containing most of the treasure - away to sink elsewhere.
Of the 650 people on board, only 45 lived. Those who clung to debris were
swept away by swirling currents. Others grabbed hold of the mast and rigging
that remained above water, but died from exposure and attacks by tiger
sharks. (Tiger sharks guard the wreck to this day.) The avaricious priests
plunged to the bottom, their cassocks weighted down by booty.
As the centuries passed, the shifting sands covered both bones and gold. But
335 years later, in 40 ft of water, a crew member scuba-diving off a salvage
ship, the RV Beacon, uncovered from the sunken bow section a cache of gold
coins and a Spanish colonial gold pectoral cross set with 66 well-matched
emeralds. The cross was auctioned at Christie's in London nine days ago,
where it fetched a record Pounds 231,000.
The cross was the prize piece in a sale of 157 lots salvaged from the
Maravillas, ranging from individual gold and silver coins and bars to
jewellery and even a bronze signal cannon - perhaps the same one that fired
that fateful shot. The sale earned the treasure hunters a total of Pounds
430,000. But the real pay-day could be to come. The Maravillas' manifest
shows it was carrying cargo worth, in present-day terms, more than Dollars
1.6bn - but the real value could be much more, because Spanish sailors
displayed great ingenuity at smuggling.
Thus, now the cross has gone under the auctioneer's hammer, the Beacon's
crew are preparing to search for the mother lode. Legend insists that, in
addition to the bullion, the Maravillas' stern also contained a life-size
statue of the Madonna and Child - weighing more than half a ton and cast
from solid gold - plus a 400 lb gold table studded with emeralds, rubies and
diamonds. If found, their value is incalculable.
Herbert Humphreys, 44, heads Marex, a Memphis-based underwater salvage
company which has been diving on the galleon since 1986. He says the
business of recovering sunken treasure can be 'boring, tedious, expensive
and dangerous.' But he adds: 'It is also one of the most exciting adventures
left on earth. To dive beneath the sea and hold in your hand a weapon, a
coin, a piece of jewellery or a tool that belonged to some unknown and
long-dead man or woman is an experience few people can have. I have seen the
stuff that dreams are made of.'
Humphreys has been hooked on these particular dreams since, aged eight and
playing on a Bahamas beach, he picked up a gold coin washed ashore by the
shifting seas. For his 16th birthday, his father - co-founder of a cooking
oil company which merged, profitably, with the giant Kraft food empire in
1951 - gave him a copy of Fell's Guide to Sunken Treasure Ships of the
World. Written on the title page is the inscription: 'Hope you find Dollars
10m. Love, Dad.' Humphreys still has the well-thumbed book but, these days,
his financial sights are set rather higher.
Indeed, he appears to have inherited a certain financial flair. He had a
private education which gave him all the traditional social graces and charm
of the Southern gentleman, and travelled the world with his parents. After
winning a horse-jumping competition at 16, he invested the Dollars 5,500
prize money in Philippines gold stock at 25 cents a share. He sold it a few
years later at Dollars 30 a share. At 22, he became convinced that the clear
waters off the Cayman Islands would be irresistible to scuba divers. So, he
negotiated a Holiday Inns' franchise for Grand Cayman at a time when there
were only two other small hotels on the island. Now, he has extensive
shipping, air charter and travel businesses in the Caribbean and Memphis.
Humphreys served in Vietnam with the US Navy. He is a qualified pilot and
parachutist who speaks and writes French and Italian. Politically, he is
right wing: he was a major-general in the FDN Legion, a Nicaraguan Contra
organisation.
His first wreck was HMS Thunderer, a British warship which went down off
Honduras in 1780 carrying looted Spanish and French cargo. It was an
archaeological dream untouched for 203 years. Archaeology is the key word,
because Humphreys regards preservation as the first and foremost goal of
treasure recovery. 'Every nail, every little pottery shard, each musket
ball, literally everything we find is treasure to me. We have an artefact
preservationist on board the Beacon who dedicates himself to preserving
these important time capsules of the past. I want to share the results of
our work with the public.' He employs a full-team of marine archaeologists
and researchers and has already given precious metals and 17th century
artefacts to museums in the Caribbean.
Inspired by his success with the Thunderer, he founded Marex (Marine
Archaeological Rescue) in 1984 and persuaded the Bahamian authorities to let
him excavate the Maravillas (they get 25 per cent). Treasure-hunting today
is many microchips away from a rowing boat and a snorkel. The Beacon is
packed with high-tech equipment, giant sand-blowers and metal detectors. It
has been searching the shallow Bahama Bank for the past five summers,
raising Dollars 5m in treasure. The annual operating costs of Dollars
200,000 come from Humphreys' own pocket.
When he is on board, he is the first diver out in the morning and the last
one back at night. Among his own discoveries was a 100.85-carat emerald, the
largest ever discovered from a shipwreck. That stimulated him still further
and now he wants to explore deep-water wrecks. To that end, Marex has just
signed a profit-share deal with the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology which,
since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is in dire need of commercial
funding.
The Russians have two MIRs - three-man submarines which can operate at
depths of nearly 20,000 ft (6,000 metres) - and filmed the Titanic in the
north Atlantic last year. They intend to start operations in the autumn and
their first targets are all in deep international waters: a 22,000-ton
liner, believed to contain 50 boxes of gold, somewhere off Liberia; a World
War Two submarine; and an ancient French wreck off Barbados thought to hold
priceless Ming porcelain, a gift from the Chinese emperor to Louis XIV.
The MIRs will be working 18-hour dives at depths where the water is pitch
black, pressure would make a man implode and the greatest danger to sanity
comes not from claustrophobia but its opposite, agoraphobia, triggered by
being surrounded by vast expanses of open sea. There is plenty of potential
to create a new industry, though. During the war, 10,000 Allied ships were
sunk by enemy action. Their unrecovered cargoes include gold, silver,
jewels, nickel, manganese, tin, copper and aluminium.
Long term, Marex has targeted 23 wrecks with cargo valued at Dollars 500m.
Retrieval costs are estimated at Dollars 35m to Dollars 50m. But while
diving on ships like the Maravillas can be seen as a hobby, albeit an
expensive one, financing deep-water salvage is altogether different.
Although the technology has been available for years, it remains largely
unproven. Investors - who accept cheerfully that it costs Dollars 90m to
repair a satellite in space, or are prepared to risk Dollars 50m financing a
movie that might prove a flop - are wary.
Humphreys is confident of success. But he admits: 'My true love is the old
wrecks because they reek of history, romance and adventure. My personal
interest in this is much more than mere monetary gain. Underwater
treasure-hunting has been my life-long interest and one that I believe to be
the last frontier on this planet.'
He hopes to strike the jackpot with the Maravillas any time now. 'Under the
water, we have found some of the gold bars from the ship marked with the
owners' names, and a trail of gold coins two miles long. We believe that
trail is leading us towards the mother lode. This season, we will find the
stern - and who knows what will be in it.'
