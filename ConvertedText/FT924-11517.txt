FT  26 OCT 92 / Chilean sell-off likely to run into opposition

CODELCO, the Chilean state copper company and the world's biggest copper
producer, plans to sell its power plant in the Atacama desert to finance
development of a new Dollars 450m (Pounds 276m) copper mine.
Mr Maximo Pacheco, Codelco's operations vice-president, said the company
hoped to raise Dollars 530m from the sale of the 530MW coal-fired power
station at Tocopilla.
He said Chilean and Argentine utilities were interested in the purchase, as
Tocopilla powered the two biggest copper mines in the world, Chuquicamata
and La Escondida, as well as cities in northern Chile.
The decision, which amounts to privatisation of one of Codelco's divisions,
is highly controversial. Codelco's public ownership is enshrined in the
Chilean constitution and has been an article of faith since the industry was
nationalised in the 1970s. But Codelco executives argue that the
constitution refers only to the state company's copper deposits.
The sell-off is certain to meet opposition from the powerful copper workers'
union. 'We have assurances from the mining minister that Tocopilla will not
be sold,' says Mr Adrian Astubillos, a union leader at the power plant. Any
backtracking would provoke the 19,000-strong union into taking strike
action, he said.
