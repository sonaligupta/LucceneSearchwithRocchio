   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent


Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
group, received a 13 per cent increase in his total remuneration last year
to Pounds 588,681, according to the company's annual report.
The increase follows a rise in 1992 to Pounds 520,316.
Excluding bonus and benefits in kind, his remuner- ation for 1993 went up by
8.8 per cent to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 455,000) following an 11.5 per cent
increase in 1992.
The total remuneration paid to RTZ's executive directors for 1993 went up by
10 per cent, from Pounds 1.87m to just over Pounds 2m. In 1992, the
executive directors received a 5.35 per cent increase.
Attributable earnings for 1993 improved by 20 per cent to Pounds 287m and
the dividend for the year is to be increased by 5 per cent to 20.5p.
In their joint statement, Sir Derek and Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive,
point out that in spite of the excep- tional severity of the fall in metal
prices, the average annual total return on RTZ shares - that is growth in
the share price coupled with dividends paid - over the past five years has
been 20.7 per cent, com- pared with the 18.1 per cent average annual total
return on the FT-SE-A All-Share Index.
