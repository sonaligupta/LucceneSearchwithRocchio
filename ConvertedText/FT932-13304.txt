FT  23 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo continues slide as
Singapore returns to peak

   TOKYO


LATE profit-taking, coupled with futures sales as a hedge against the yen's
extended advance against the dollar, pushed equity prices lower for a fifth
consecutive session in light volume, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 181.70 down at 19,591.31, after an intraday low of
19,557.78 and a high of 20,116.86. The broader Topix index of all first
section stocks lost 9.53 to 1,523.03, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 2.00 to 1,202.15.
Volume was estimated at 380m shares, compared with Wednesday's 395m. Losers
outpaced advances by 721 to 318, with 133 issues unchanged.
Foreign exchange considerations again dominated equity trading in Tokyo.
Market participants sold and bought shares in tandem with the rise and fall
of the yen, which finally settled at Y110.20 to the dollar. While
uncertainties about the stability of the yen remain, investors are expected
to continue to take profits.
Chart analysts predict that the Nikkei will test its 25-day moving average
of 19,493.44 in the short term. Below this level, however, buy orders from
government-managed public funds are likely to serve as a support for share
prices.
Mr Shigeru Akiba, director of yen equity trading at UBS Securities, said
afternoon sales of futures contracts triggered arbitrage-related selling
that pressured the cash market.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the Tokyo market, receded
Y44,000 to Y893,000, the first time it has settled below Y900,000 since
March 31.
NTT-related shares also moved into negative territory. Fujikura, the
electric wire and cable manufacturer, dropped Y37 to Y911, while Mitsubishi
Cable declined Y24 to Y686.
Profit-taking pushed the high-technology sector lower. NEC fell Y16 to Y921,
Mitsubishi Electric Y10 to Y548 and Hitachi Y7 to Y822. Motor-related shares
lost ground. Honda weakened Y80 to Y1,410, while Toyota shed Y10 to Y1,630.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 83.57 to end at 21,450.22 in volume of
27.9m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets turned in a mostly strong performance. Recent strength
in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur has been attributed to portfolio adjustment on
expectations that the Morgan Stanley Capital index, presently combining the
two markets, will be split at the beginning of next month, some analysts
said.
SINGAPORE returned to its record-setting ways as low interest rates
continued to boost liquidity. Buyers focused on laggard small-capital stocks
and warrants, and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.15 to 1,773.21.
KUALA LUMPUR ended its four-day rally with a dip in the composite index of
0.25 to 691.45.
TAIWAN surged ahead as the government was poised to tighten the Copyright
Law, in a move to avoid trade retaliation by the US, which had been
demanding stricter controls on protecting intellectual property rights.
The weighted index advanced 149.06, or 3.3 per cent, to 4,631.69. Turnover
fell to TDollars 14.7bn from TDollars 31.4bn.
SEOUL rewrote its 20-month high, the composite index rising 4.01 to 735.57
in volume of 61.3m shares. Electronics and other blue chip sectors led the
rise.
NEW ZEALAND closed near to an all-time peak, with the advance fuelled by
continuing strong interest in forestry shares.
The NZSE-40 index climbed 22.19, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,627.12 in strong
turnover of NZDollars 48m. The 1,627.31 historic high of the 2 1/2 -year old
index was set on February 16.
Foreign buying was again concentrated on forestry stocks, which are
benefiting from lumber price increases.
MANILA rose as investors tried to shake off fears caused by the government's
takeover of the board of directors of market leader PLDT. The composite
index moved ahead 7.94 to 1,540.70 as PLDT fell 15 pesos to 945 pesos.
AUSTRALIA was higher, with banks, especially Westpac, attracting interest.
The All Ordinaries index finished 11.5 up at 1,705.4.
HONG KONG eased on volatile futures-led activity, as Sino-British talks
opened in Beijing. The Hang Seng index ended 9.15 down at 6,759.24 in
turnover of HKDollars 6.3bn, against Wednesday's HKDollars 4.3bn.
While prices started higher on hopes of better relations between Beijing and
London, afternoon futures-led selling eroded the gains.
BOMBAY fell to a 15-month low, depressed by expectations of disappointing
company results. The BSE index shed 30.55 to 2,158.96.
