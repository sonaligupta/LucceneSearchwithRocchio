FT  20 JUL 94 / International Company News: CBS chairman dismisses takeover
speculation


   By MARTIN DICKSON


Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman of CBS, the television broadcasting network,
yesterday denied the business was for sale and dismissed rumours that
Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest US cable system company, might join
forces with Mr Barry Diller, the television executive, to bid for the
company.
Mr Tisch, speaking during a visit to CBS's Hollywood facilities, said:
'Let's make it abundantly clear, CBS is not for sale . . . We have the best
group of executives in television at CBS and I am looking forward to the
challenge of the coming seasons.'
Last week, merger talks between CBS and QVC, the home shopping network
headed by Mr Diller, broke down because of an unexpected bid for QVC from
cable systems company Comcast. Comcast and TCI are substantial shareholders
in QVC.
He dismissed the idea of a TCI/Diller bid and brushed aside rumours that
Walt Disney might bid for CBS.
