FT  21 APR 94 / PSBR is Pounds 3.9bn less than forecast


   By GRAHAM BOWLEY


The government borrowed Pounds 11.3bn to finance public-sector spending in
March, taking the total borrowing requirement for the 1993-94 financial year
to Pounds 45.9bn - Pounds 3.9bn less than predicted in the November Budget.
Debt repayment by local authorities, which was Pounds 2bn higher than had
been anticipated, and lower central government borrowing - Pounds 2.3bn
below predictions - were the main reasons for the undershoot.
Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'Having
underspent this year, government departments will find it that much harder
to increase their spending in the future.'
He said that it was likely that the Budget forecast of Pounds 38bn for the
PSBR in the financial year 1994-95 would also be met.
The Treasury said spending by all government departments was lower than
expected, although the fall in social security payments as unemployment had
fallen had played an important part.
Excluding privatisation proceeds, the PSBR was Pounds 12.5bn in March and
Pounds 51.3bn for the financial year 1993-94 - compared with Pounds 44.8bn
in 1992-93 and Pounds 3.9bn below the budget forecast.
Privatisation proceeds in March were Pounds 1.2bn - mainly receipts from the
British Telecommunications share issue - giving a 1993-94 total of Pounds
5.4bn.
Central government borrowing on its own account in March was Pounds 8bn and
Pounds 47.8bn for 1993-94, compared with Pounds 42.4bn in 1992-93. Local
authorities borrowed Pounds 1.9bn in March, but paid back Pounds 2.7bn in
the year. Public corporations borrowed Pounds 1.4bn in March - a net Pounds
800m in the whole year.
