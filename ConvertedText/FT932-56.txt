FT  30 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungary to reorganise meat
industry


   By REUTER


   BUDAPEST


HUNGARY PLANS a sweeping reorganisation of its meat industry to reduce
excess processing capacity and strengthen a sector hit hard by the collapse
of its traditional markets in eastern Europe, officials said, reports Reuter
from Budapest.
Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the agriculture ministry, said the
consolidation scheme could allow enterprises carrying heavy debt loads, but
otherwise able to compete, to refinance themselves with bonds that the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would subscribe as the sole
buyer.
He said the EBRD had reviewed the plan favourably but the Hungarian
government still needed to approve it. In any event, Hungary would be forced
to close some unprofitable plants, he added.
