FT  10 JAN 92 / Stagnation seen in west Midlands


THE WEST Midlands economy presents a 'picture of almost total stagnation',
the region's chambers of commerce group said yesterday.
Its survey of 700 companies, mainly small and medium-sized, showed that 76
per cent of manufacturing companies and 71 per cent of service companies had
seen either the same or lower levels of domestic orders over the last three
months.
