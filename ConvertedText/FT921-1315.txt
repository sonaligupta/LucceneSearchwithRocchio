FT  25 MAR 92 / Appointments: From Kwik Save to Hillsdown


Hillsdown Holdings' search for a finance director to replace Kevin
O'Sullivan, who left after totting up the food processing group's recent
annual figures, has been concluded with the appointment of Simon Moffat.
Currently finance director at Kwik Save, the discount grocery retailer,
Moffat will finalise Kwik Save's interim results before moving to Hillsdown
in June.
Moffat, 39, spent 14 years with Unilever and two with Grand Metropolitan
before joining Kwik Save in 1990. He says that his experience of working for
a number of 'strong-minded chief executives' will be helpful for his job at
Hillsdown. And he is keen to work for an international food group again. He
vows that Hillsdown will use the proceeds of its recent, controversial
rights issue wisely.
Meanwhile Kwik Save has promoted John Murphy, head of its Coleman's
subsidiary, to take over the role of deputy managing director from Frederick
Mills who will be retiring next February. Kwik Save says it will announce a
replacement for Moffat as soon as possible.

Lowndes Lambert, the insurance broking group which was floated last year,
has reached into its past with the appointment of Sir Robert Clark to be its
non-executive director and deputy chairman. Roy Watts, non-executive
chairman, is retiring and Richard Shaw, currently chief executive, becomes
executive chairman.
Sir Robert, well known in the City, was chairman of Lowndes' former parent
company, Hill Samuel, at the time of the group's management buyout in 1987.
He was also a director and deputy chairman of TSB Group between 1989 and
1991.
Currently he is a director of Shell Transport and Trading, Alfred McAlpine
and Vodafone, and vice chairman of SmithKline Beecham.

Tom Cannon, the long-serving managing director of BSG International, the
motor components, vehicle distribution and consumer products group, is
stepping up to chairman next year. Astley Whittall, 68, the present
incumbent, is to retire. The new managing director will be Richard Marton,
currently running the consumer and special products division.
This orderly succession reflects the BSG policy of promoting from within.
Cannon, now 63, has worked his way through the group, starting as a cashier
in 1951. Whittall has been chairman for 11 years. Marton, who joined BSG as
the result of a takeover 19 years ago, has been with the group for a shorter
time than any of the other executive directors.
