FT  20 APR 94 / Bogus food claims test companies


Most food companies sent compensation to researchers who sent bogus letters
of complaint.
Researchers at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology wrote false letters of complaint to 233 companies and 83 per cent
replied with postal orders, cheques or goods.
Dr Vince Mitchell said: 'As the recession continues more and more people are
exploiting companies and their desire for good customer relations.'
