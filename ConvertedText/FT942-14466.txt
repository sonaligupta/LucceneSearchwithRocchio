FT  20 APR 94 / International Company News: Golden Vale up 14% as
acquisitions hit margins

Golden Vale, the Irish dairy group, reported a 14 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits from IPounds 16.7m to IPounds 19m (Pounds 18.5m) for the
year to December 31.
Turnover rose 42 per cent from IPounds 298m to IPounds 423.2m, including
IPounds 47m from acquisitions. Exports accounted for IPounds 297m of the
total.
Operating margins fell as a result of a series of acquisitions made during
the year, according to Mr Jim O'Mahony, chief executive.
He anticipated a return to 'historically higher than average margins' from
rationalisation measures being carried out in the new companies. However,
'profit maximisation' from the acquisitions would not occur before 1995.
The acquisitions of Leckpatrick Dairies in Northern Ireland, and Vonk and VM
in Denmark and the Netherlands respectively, contributed significantly to
higher net borrowings of IPounds 94.8m at the year end, compared with
IPounds 7.5m a year earlier.
A total of IPounds 83.3m was spent on acquisitions in 1993 including
assumption of debts.
Year end gearing was 139 per cent after a goodwill write-off of IPounds
30.2m, against 8.8 per cent at the start of the year. Total net assets
increased from IPounds 87.5m to IPounds 93.3m.
Mr Liam Irvine, finance director, said that although gearing seemed high,
the company was comfortable with the level of borrowing, an interest cover
of 7.3 and cash flow generation of IPounds 25m during 1993.
The company plans further expansion into the European market and the
development of new products to achieve greater value-added on its primary
dairy products. Turnover of primary dairy products fell from 25 per cent to
18 per cent of the total in 1993.
Earnings per share were up 9 per cent at 10.02p (9.2p) and a final dividend
of 1.35p is recommended for a total of 1.95p (1.63p).
