companies


   By ROLAND RUDD


Smith New Court, the UK securities house, is expanding its marketmaking
activities in shares of smaller companies.
The move comes after three marketmakers, SG Warburg Securities, County
NatWest and UBS Phillips & Drew Securities, withdrew from making markets in
shares of many small companies.
Smith New Court is to start dealing today in another 44 stocks, making a
total of 85 in smaller companies faced with transfer from the Stock Exchange
Seaq trading system to the Company Bulletin Board and the newly unveiled
Stock Exchange Alternative Trading System.
