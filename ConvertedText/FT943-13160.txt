FT  21 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alcan Aluminium of Canada sells
stake in Australian unit

Alcan Aluminium, of Canada, has sold its 73.3 per cent holding in Alcan
Australia via an international secondary offering worth USDollars 245m.
Alcan had already said that it planned to dispose of its controlling stake.
CS First Boston, the investment bankers and underwriter for the issue,
placed the Alcan Australia shares with institutional investors in Australia,
Europe, North America and Asia.
The placement totalled 130.8m shares at ADollars 2.55 (USDollars 1.87) a
share.
Alcan Australia employs 2,400 at seven plants and at distribution centres in
Australia and New Zealand. But it is the smallest of Australia's integrated
producers, with sales only one-third of rivals Alcoa Australia and Comalco.
Alcan Australia's primary capacity is 155,000 tonnes per year at its New
South Wales smelter against 400,000 tonnes each for its competitors.
Alcan Australia has a larger proportion of its business in downstream
activities. It represents 9 per cent of Alcan Aluminium's total world
primary metal capacity.
Alcan Aluminium retains its bauxite mining interests in Australia and a 21.4
per cent stake in Queensland Alumina. It will continue to supply alumina and
technology to the independent Alcan Australia and will market the latter's
primary metal in Asia.
Also, Alcan Australia will market Alcan products in Australia and New
Zealand using the Alcan name until the end of 1995.
The 26.7 per cent of Alcan Australia not under Canadian control has been
held by various Australian institutions.
Meanwhile, Alcan Australia yesterday announced a return to the black for the
June half despite major production cuts affecting the worldwide aluminium
industry.
The company turned a ADollars 2.9m loss into a ADollars 9.4m net profit in
the period on a marginal increase in sales revenue from ADollars 301.9m to
ADollars 307.5m.
Directors said the profit was 'still modest' and the company would not pay
an interim dividend.
The earnings improvement came despite a 10 per cent cut in primary aluminium
output, beginning this year, following an agreement among the world's major
aluminium producers to reduce oversupply.
The result followed total tax provision of ADollars 7.5m , compared to
ADollars 8.4m previously, and interest expense of ADollars 5.4m, compared to
ADollars 6.6m.
