FT  12 APR 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney syndicates meet over
rescue plan

Leaders of the Euro Disney loan syndicates yesterday met the company's
Japanese creditors in Paris in a bid to persuade them to agree to plans for
the troubled leisure group's FFr13bn (Dollars 2.22bn) rescue package.
Most of the 63 international banks in the Euro Disney syndicates are
understood to have agreed in principle to the rescue. Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) and Banque Indosuez, joint leaders of the banks' steering
committee, hope by Friday to have finalised the agreement.
But the banks have yet to agree terms for underwriting of the rights issue.
Japanese creditors - including LTCB of Japan, Mitsubishi Trust, Sumitomo,
Bank of Tokyo and Industrial Bank of Japan - are reluctant to be involved
with the underwriting.
The Japanese banks yesterday pressed BNP and Indosuez for exemption from the
underwriting. They also urged that the Caisse des Depots et Consignations,
which is Euro Disney's biggest lender, should play a larger part in the
restructuring.
