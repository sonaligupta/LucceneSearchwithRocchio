FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Teaching method to ignore


   From Mr PETER TAYLOR


Sir, The teaching method for mathematics by Mr Toru Kumon ('Japan adds a new
number to its exports', June 20) gave me an instant impression of a bad
April 1 joke. It would fit neatly into that stereotyped niche in my mind
which expects people of particular races to behave in a consistently
peculiar way.
Just to debunk this nonsense I would have liked to have read about a real
attempt to help pupils in their mathematical studies - but, unfortunately,
it did not turn out that way. Here is an author requiring pupils to work
through 3,800 pages in the course of the programme; controlled by specially
trained teachers who would see to it that pupils never deviate from the
elitist path of getting all work perfectly right; goals of conceptual
ability being casually brushed aside.
I began to wonder about the hard grind it would be for the slow learner, and
the ruin it would inflict on those bright children who, in later life, make
out to be the quality engineers on whom we rely so much because of their
natural love and understanding of machinery of all kinds.
I just hope that parents and teachers will ignore this programme of school
text books, or look at it very critically before inflicting it on the ones
in their care.
