FT  01 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Reduced demand affects Hewetson


Hewetson, the Hull-based flooring products and construction materials group,
announced sharply lower annual profits and a reduced final dividend.
Mr Peter Price, chairman, said the decline was mainly attributable to
reduced demand for access flooring which in turn saw group turnover for the
year to March 31 fall from Pounds 43m to Pounds 32.4m.
Costs of reorganisation at the operation were taken above the line as an
exceptional charge of Pounds 251,000, contributing to a 54 per cent fall to
Pounds 745,000 (Pounds 1.61m) in pre-tax profits.
Interest charges, however, fell to Pounds 490,000 (Pounds 798,000) as
gearing was cut from 103 per cent to 48 per cent following reduced stocks
and last August's rights issue.
Fully diluted earnings per share emerged at 4.35p (10.81p). The final
dividend is cut to 1p (2.9p) for a 2.6p (4.5p) total.
