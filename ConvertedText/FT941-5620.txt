FT  05 MAR 94 / Research adds fuel to top pay row


   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff


The basic pay of top executives has risen far more quickly than that of
clerical workers since the Conservatives came to power, according to
research published yesterday.
The result follows criticism of high pay rises in Britain's boardrooms by
politicians of all parties.
The research, by Hay Management Consultants, says pre-tax clerical salaries
have increased by 333 per cent since 1978-79 while basic salaries at
executive or director level have increased by 416 per cent.
The gap is likely to be wider in view of bonuses paid at boardroom level,
and the gap in take-home pay is wider still, as top earners have benefited
more from tax cuts than those lower down the scale.
Research by P-E International, the management research organisation,
suggests that senior executives in the food, drink and tobacco industries
got the biggest percentage increases in basic salaries last year - 8.3 per
cent in the year to July 1993, compared with 4.4 per cent in financial
services and 7.5 per cent in util-ities.
The P-E study allows comparisons between chief executives and managers, but
does not cover other groups of employees.
Mr Nick Boulter, a director of Hay, said executives' pay had grown more
rapidly in recent years, but clerical pay had doubled between 1971 and 1976
while that of executives rose only 50 per cent.
A recent index of executive pay by Sedgwick Noble Lowndes showed that
bonuses and perks (excluding share options) could add as much as 40 per cent
to an average executive's salary.
This is partly responsible for the growing gulf between gross earnings of
chief executives and average earners, illustrated in the management pay
review chart published this week by Incomes Data Services. Gross earnings
include bonuses.
