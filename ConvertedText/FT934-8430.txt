FT  16 NOV 93 / Supply licence no longer required for companies generating
their own electricity


   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT


COMPANIES that want to generate their own electricity will no longer need a
supply licence, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
announced yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes.
Mr Heseltine told the CBI that the decision was evidence of the government's
determination to deregulate.
'Like competitiveness, deregulation has no end date. There is always more to
do,' he said. The electricity decision removes a requirement that companies
generating electricity for their own use need a licence if they consume less
than 51 per cent of the output themselves.
Mr Heseltine said the rule distorted investment decisions. It made it more
difficult for companies to choose the most economic generation plant, such
as combined heat and power schemes. This in turn reduced their
competitive-ness.
He said: 'Competitiveness is the key to prosperity.'
