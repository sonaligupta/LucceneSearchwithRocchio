FT  27 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape


Yesterday's interim results from Inchcape were on the face of it
encouraging. The impact of the strong yen on its European motor distribution
business was bad - operating profits dropped Pounds 20m as a result - but
not as bad as analysts had predicted. Moreover, strong results from other
divisions helped make up the slack, demonstrating the resilience inherent in
the group's spread of activities.
Yet some of the shine was taken off the figures because of management
caution about the outlook for the full year. Stocks, particularly of cars,
are also up sharply, highlighting an underlying weakness in Inchcape's
bargaining position with the manufacturers which supply it. Though the fall
in motor trade margins from 3.9 to 2.9 per cent largely reflects currency
movements, Inchcape is unlikely to recoup the slippage easily even when
currency pressures subside. The priority of its suppliers will be to improve
their own margins as soon as market conditions permit. Inchcape's position
as a distributor thus leaves it vulnerable to a squeeze which will limit the
cyclical upturn in its profits.
