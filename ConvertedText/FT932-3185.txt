FT  15 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets cautious ahead of
CPI data


   By PATRICK HARVERSON

Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended marginally firmer yesterday as dealers and investors
braced themselves for the second set of important inflation data in three
days, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 9.68 up at 3,514.69. The Standard &
Poor's 500 edged up 0.45 to 447.71 and the Nasdaq composite gained 3.22 at
696.41. Volume on the New York SE was 216m shares, while falls and rises ran
almost neck and neck at 952 to 945.
After Friday's promising producer prices report for May (the producer prices
index was flat for the month), which helped assuage fears that a resurgence
in inflation would force up interest rates, the markets opened in a broadly
positive mood. Further gains in Treasury prices, which pushed bond yields
lower, also helped to improve equity investor sentiment.
The advance in stocks, however, was modest, and the Dow struggled all day to
post double-digit gains in light trading. A fear of trading ahead of today's
consumer prices data was behind the markets' subdued showing.
Although analysts are forecasting that the consumer prices index for May
will have risen by only 0.2 per cent, dealers and investors were aware that
a surprisingly strong CPI number could derail both stocks and bonds.
Eastman Kodak jumped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 in volume of 2.36m
shares after the company unexpectedly announced plans for a meeting with
investors and analysts today. Kodak did not explain why it was calling the
meeting, but analysts speculated that the company may announce some form of
restructuring.
Technology stocks, which have been see-sawing wildly in recent trading
sessions, were mixed in heavy trading yesterday. Hewlett-Packard climbed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 87 1/2 , Compaq advanced Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars
55 7/8 and Motorola put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 84 5/8 , but Unisys eased
Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 and IBM declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 52.
US Surgical fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 26 5/8 in volume of 2.67m shares
as investors got the first chance to respond to Friday's forecast by the
company that because of declining sales it will post a loss in the second
quarter of the year, compared with a year ago profit of 58 cents a share.
Johnson Products forged ahead Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the
American Stock Exchange after Ivax announced that it was buying the company
for somewhere between Dollars 61m and Dollars 73m. Johnson, however, said it
may consider other offers.
Canada
TORONTO recovered from slight weakness to end a fairly quiet day of trade on
a mixed note. The selection of defence minister Kim Campbell to replace
outgoing Prime Minister Brian Mulroney eased some political worries, traders
said. Gold issues, which have led the market over the last few months,
turned round from midday softness to end firmer.
The TSE 300 index put on 5.7 at 3,872.2 but declines narrowly led advances
by 363 to 332. Volume contracted to 46.5m shares. Yesterday's turnover was
boosted by a block trade of 5.4m Talisman Energy shares.
Newbridge Networks declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100
per cent stock dividend. The shares surged CDollars 4 3/4 to CDollars 110
1/2.
