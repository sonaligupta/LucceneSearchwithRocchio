FT  15 APR 94 / UK Company News: Ipeco declines 29% to Pounds 2.35m


Ipeco Holdings suffered a 29 per cent fall in 1993 pre-tax profits. The
aviation and defence industry supplier blamed the decline on poor conditions
in the civil aerospace sector.
After restructuring costs of Pounds 200,000 the pre-tax figure was Pounds
2.35m (Pounds 3.3m).
Turnover was slightly higher at Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 19.9m).
The company said despite cost reductions, order rescheduling left the core
flight deck equipment business lower. Trading in the other subsidiaries was
mixed with good results from the smaller aerospace operations and steady
progress in the second half in some defence-related areas.
Earnings per share were 5.45p (7.72p) but the board is recommending an
unchanged final dividend of 2.3p, maintaining the total for the year at
3.6p.
