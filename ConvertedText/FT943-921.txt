FT  27 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Getting the message - but in English
only


   From Mr MAX HOTOPF


Sir, My publishing business is relocating. As our customers cover the globe,
I wanted to leave a message giving our new phone number in English, French
and German. Imagine my utter amazement to discover that BT is incapable of
doing this. The message can only be in English. And what is the cost of this
recorded message? Pounds 50 a quarter]
Right across Europe I listen to recorded messages re-routing me in every
language under the sun.
Yes, I could leave an answering machine on the line to give a message in
English, French and German. But then, of course, I would have to continue to
to pay BT for the line.
The alternative is to have calls re-routed through to the new number. For
this BT charges Pounds 82.60 a quarter plus a Pounds 50 charge for
connection. The service is only available for a minimum of 12 months - so
the re-routing option costs a minimum of Pounds 380.40. And you have to pay
local call rates on top for every transferred call.
Could all this reflect the fact that BT faces no competition in this area?
