FT  26 JUN 92 / Horton is ousted as chairman of British Petroleum: Directors
point to personality clashes as reason for shock decision


   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor


MR ROBERT HORTON, the chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, one
of Britain biggest companies, resigned last night in what appeared to be a
coup by his fellow directors.
Mr Horton was confronted by BP directors at a meeting earlier this week.
They made clear last night that it was problems of personality rather than
business strategy which lay behind the decision to replace Mr Horton.
In a sudden announcement after markets closed, BP said its 17-member board
had accepted Mr Horton's resignation 'with considerable sadness'. Board
members made clear they were concerned about the concentration of power in
the hands of Mr Horton, one of the UK's most forceful business executives.
His position is to be split between Lord Ashburton, a non-executive
director, who becomes chairman, and Mr David Simon, chief operating officer,
who will take over as group chief executive.
Mr Horton, who is 52 and only assumed his position in 1990, said in a
statement: 'I have reluctantly concluded it is in the best interests of BP
that I should leave the company. I do so in the knowledge that BP has a fine
team to see it through a difficult period, which has combined low product
prices with a depressed chemical industry performance.'
Last night's remarkable developments come at a time when BP is under severe
financial pressure because of the recession and the weakness of the oil
price. The company is going through a Pounds 750m cost-cutting exercise with
the loss of hundreds of jobs.
Lord Ashburton, formerly Sir John Baring of the Barings merchant bank, said
he and his fellow directors had been increasingly concerned about the way
the company was being run. 'We came to the unanimous conclusion to discuss
with Bob Horton the need to make a change at the top,' he said.
He said directors believed the governing structure of BP should be changed
to split the role of chairman and chief executive, and particularly that BP
should have a full-time chief executive.
Asked whether Mr Horton's personal style, which has been described as
arrogant and abrasive, played a role in the board's decision, Lord Ashburton
said: 'We felt the company would be better organised if we had a change of
individual.'
He said there was nothing specific in Mr Horton's handling of the company
which had prompted the directors to act. 'It was an accumulation of
feelings, of events, all quite small in themselves,' he said.
The non-executives directors' anxieties grew over some months. Finally, at a
meeting earlier this week they confronted Mr Horton with the need for
change. When he saw the position, Mr Horton immediately offered to resign.
The executive directors, who are in a minority, supported the changes. A
further board meeting, from which Mr Horton was absent, took place yesterday
to ratify the changes. The terms of Mr Horton's severance have not yet been
addressed.
Lord Ashburton said BP was fortunate in having in Mr Simon 'a successor as
chief executive who has wide experience of the group'. Mr Simon, 52, had
previously held positions as chief financial officer and chief executive of
BP Oil, the group's exploration and production arm. He was also Mr Horton's
chief rival for the top job in 1990 on the retirement of Sir Peter Walters.
His appointment to the chief executive position will be seen in the City as
a sweet, if belated, victory in that earlier contest. It was also expected
to be a popular choice within BP where Mr Horton's manner had not endeared
him to staff. The combination of his dominant personality and the swingeing
job cuts had begun to depress morale.
Mr Simon stressed that last night's upheaval would not result in dramatic
changes in BP's business direction or in wider staff or structural changes.
'This is about the style of running the company at the top', he said. 'It is
not about changes in strategy.'
Analysts also speculated that a factor in Mr Horton's resignation had been
boardroom division over dividend policy.
Under Mr Horton, BP has steadfastly refused to cut its dividend in spite of
falling profits and rising debt levels, a policy which initially pleased
BP's large institutional shareholders but which, more recently, came to be
viewed as short-sighted because it ate into investment budgets.
In the first quarter of this year, BP's profits fell 80 per cent to the
point where they did not cover the company's unchanged dividend. Mr Simon
refused to comment in detail on BP's performance in the current quarter for
which results will be announced August.
He denied that dividend policy disagreements had contributed to Mr Horton's
resignation.
