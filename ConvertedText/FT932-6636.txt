FT  27 MAY 93 / UK Company News: BP agrees division sale to managers for
Pounds 250m


   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES


BRITISH PETROLEUM agreed yesterday to sell its consumer products division to
a management buy-out for Pounds 250m. Sir Allen Sheppard will become
non-executive chairman of the new company with Mr Michael Handley,
previously divisional managing director of RHM, to become managing director.
The consumer products division is a leading supplier of household
detergents, cleaners and personal care products to supermarkets. It
comprises Robert McBride in the UK, Yplon in Belgium and Solaro in Italy
with a workforce of 4,000 and a turnover last year of Pounds 350m.
Financial backing for the buy-out was put together by Legal and General, the
insurance company, which is understood to have beaten several other
management groups in the bidding process.
The consumer products division is the second of BP Nutrition's businesses to
be sold since the sector was put up for sale about a year ago.
Consumer Foods was sold to Sara Lee, the US group, last December. Purina,
animal foods in the US and other animal feeds businesses in Europe are still
for sale.
The consumer products business is understood to have enjoyed solid profits
in the past couple of years although BP will not disclose figures.
