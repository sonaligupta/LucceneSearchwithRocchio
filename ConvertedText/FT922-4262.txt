FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tapie holding company falls into
red

THE FINANCIAL fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial entrepreneur
who last week resigned from the French cabinet because of a fraud case,
yesterday took a turn for the worse when Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his
holding company, announced that it had fallen into a net loss of FFr294.9m
(Dollars 54.6m) last year.
The BTF announcement intensified speculation about the future of its 51 per
cent stake in Adidas, the German sporting goods group, which it acquired two
years ago. Mr Tapie recently announced he might consider selling Adidas.
Pentland, the UK consumer products company which last year bought 20 per
cent of Adidas, is thought to be a likely purchaser.
Mr Frank Farrant, director of Pentland, said yesterday that 'if Mr Tapie is
interested in selling we would certainly be buyers - providing the price was
right'.
BTF is still trying to pay off the remainder of the FFr2bn debt incurred in
the Adidas deal, which was viewed from the outset as a risky acquisition
because the German group was far larger than Mr Tapie's existing interests,
most of which he had acquired as bankrupt businesses in the early 1980s.
BTF's shares were suspended in Paris for an hour shortly after the
announcement. They rose by FFr3.5 during the day's trading to close at
FFr138.5.
One reason for BTF's swing into the red - from net profits of FFr47.97m in
1990 - was a FFr184m payment towards Adidas. By the end of 1991 its net debt
stood at FFr3.64bn, 21 per cent lower than a year before, and shareholders
funds at FFr1.72bn, a 26 per cent reduction. BTF said it would this month
make the final FFr730m repayment on Adidas.
BTF hopes to sell Testut-Terraillon, its weighing machine business, which is
already provisioned in the 1991 accounts, to help raise the FFr730m. It has
already raised FFr365m by selling several businesses, including the La Vie
Claire health food chain and a stake in the TF1 television station.
Meanwhile, Adidas is continuing its rationalisation programme by closing one
of its two Swiss subsidiaries with the loss of 27 jobs. It faces bitter
union opposition to its plans to shed 500 jobs in France.
Pentland, which negotiated pre-emptive rights over the rest of the Tapie
holding in Adidas as part of last year's deal, has made no secret of its
interest in Adidas. Mr Farrant said it had 'off and on contact' with Mr
Tapie.
