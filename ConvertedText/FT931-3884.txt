FT  13 MAR 93 / Fall in savings points to recovery


   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff


INDIVIDUALS were less inclined to save in the final quarter of last year, a
trend consistent with evidence of a modest recovery in consumer spending.
Figures published yesterday showed that the savings ratio, which measures
personal savings as a percentage of total income, dropped from a seasonally
adjusted 12.3 per cent in the third quarter to an adjusted 11.4 per cent in
the fourth quarter.
The fall, which coincided with several reductions in UK interest rates, took
the ratio back to roughly the same level as at the beginning of the year.
The drop was widely expected as high redundancy payments in the third
quarter had boosted the savings ratio to an eight-year high.
For last year as a whole the ratio was 11.6 per cent compared with 9.7 per
cent in 1991.
The Central Statistical Office figures also showed that personal disposable
income rose a slim 0.3 per cent in the final quarter compared with the
third. An increase of 1 per cent in prices over the same period, however,
meant that in real terms, personal disposable income was 0.8 per cent lower.
Compared with the same quarter in 1991, real personal disposable income was
2.5 per cent higher.
Consumer expenditure in the final quarter rose by 1 per cent and by 3.9 per
cent compared with the same quarter the year before.
The state of company finances continued to improve on an annual basis with
seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO showing a financial deficit of
Pounds 10.5bn last year compared with Pounds 11.1bn in 1991. However, this
was less than half the size of the deficit in 1989 when it was Pounds
22.7bn.
In the final quarter the deficit narrowed to Pounds 1.4bn from Pounds 1.7bn
in the third quarter.
Gross trading profits of the corporate sector, net of stock appreciation,
stayed at about Pounds 19.7bn in the final quarter. The figure was
maintained by North Sea oil companies' gross trading profits which increased
by 18 per cent from Pounds 1.5bn in the third quarter to Pounds 1.8bn in the
fourth.
Trading profits from non-North Sea oil companies fell in the final quarter
compared with the third quarter from Pounds 18.2bn to Pounds 17.9bn.
