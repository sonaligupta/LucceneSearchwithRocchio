FT  29 APR 94 / International Company News: Soap war of words intensifies


   By TONY JACKSON


The war of words between the world's two leading detergents companies hotted
up yesterday, as Unilever accused Procter & Gamble of 'sour grapes' in its
attacks on Unilever's new concentrated detergents. The products, presently
being launched across Europe under such brand names as Persil and Omo, were
claimed by Procter two days ago to damage clothing.
The argument centres on the catalyst developed by Unilever for the new
products, dubbed the Accelerator. Containing manganese, the catalyst is
claimed to permit faster washing at lower temperatures.
Procter said: 'Our own experience of the manganese Accelerator is that it
causes abnormal fabric damage. Our own initial testing of the Lever
Accelerator products caused us to raise serious concerns with Unilever . . .
We subsequently requested independent institutes to run fabric safety
testing (of the products).'
Procter said it was worried that because fabric damage was progressive, and
consumers switched brands, Procter products could be blamed for damage.
Unilever confirmed that meetings had taken place with Procter but said it
could not confirm Procter's findings. Unilever offered a joint approach to
an independent institute to test the results, but Procter had refused. A
Unilever spokesman said: 'I can only assume they wanted to find a way of
scuppering (our products). They suggested to us we stop the launch.  You can
imagine what response they got.'
Unilever said although attempts to use manganese in detergents went back
many years, only 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the catalyst consisted of the
chemical. Rather than causing unusual damage to fabrics, a Unilever
scientist said, the new detergents should preserve them longer.
