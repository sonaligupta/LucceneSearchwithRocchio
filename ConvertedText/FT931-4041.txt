Ben Bailey Construction, the Yorkshire-based housebuilder, returned to
profit in the six months to December 31 with Pounds 24,000 before tax in the

June 30 1992 and profits of Pounds 107,000 in the previous first half.
Turnover was Pounds 8.26m, against Pounds 9.66m which included Pounds 1.26m
from discontinued operations. Interest payable fell to Pounds 202,000
(Pounds 305,000).
The company said the number of units completed rose to 151 (133) but the
average selling price was Pounds 1,000 lower at Pounds 49,000.
A lower interim dividend of 0.25p is payable from earnings per share of
0.16p (0.7p).
The company has changed its year end to December 31.
