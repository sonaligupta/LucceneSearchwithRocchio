FT  20 APR 94 / Observer: Anglo's Politico


The tentacles of Anglo American, the powerful conglomerate, have always
extended beyond the boardrooms of South Africa. No surprise then that even
in the new South Africa there was an Anglo representative on duty when
yesterday's historic deal which brought Chief Buthelezi into next week's
elections was signed.
Standing discreetly in the background at Union Buildings, the seat of
government in Pretoria, was none other than Michael Spicer, an Anglo
director possessed of one of the keenest political brains in the country,
who was taking a close interest in the proceedings that led to the
breakthrough.
