FT  06 JAN 94 / International Company News: US broker and Mellon Bank settle
fund row


   By PATRICK HARVERSON


   NEW YORK


Smith Barney Shearson, the Wall Street brokerage house, and Mellon Bank, the
US banking group, yesterday ended their row over who should administer
mutual funds from the old Shearson Lehman firm when they reached a
settlement that will allow the two companies to share the administration of
the disputed funds.
The agreement concludes a four-month feud between the two companies. Last
month, Mellon had secured an injunction preventing Smith Barney Shearson
from diverting its mutual fund administration business away from the Boston
Company, the money management operation which Mellon bought from Shearson
for Dollars 1.45bn in 1992.
The injunction came on the heels of a lawsuit Mellon had filed contending
that Smith Barney Shearson had broken an agreement drawn up when Shearson
merged with Smith Barney in March 1993. Under the terms of that pact, the
Boston Company was to administer Shearson's mutual funds, as had been agreed
when the firm was sold to Mellon the year before.
Under yesterday's settlement, however, Smith Barney Shearson agreed to pass
on some of the administrative business for its funds to the Boston Company.
The two sides said the agreement would last until May 2000.
