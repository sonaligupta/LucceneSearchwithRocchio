The Institute of Taxation, which has grown rapidly in recent years and now
has 10,000 members, has appointed Robert Dommett 48, as its first ever
secretary-general.
Dommett, who was chief executive of the Surrey Building Society which merged
with Northern Rock in 1993, takes on the new upgraded post after the
retirement of Ronald Ison, secretary, next February.
The IoT appointment comes at a time when the institute is seeking a higher
profile and has become increasingly critical of the quality and quantity of
new tax law and the efficiency of its implementation.
Dommett, who rose through the ranks of the Chartered Building Society to
become deputy chief executive, is a fellow of the institute of bankers and
the chartered institute of secretaries and administrators. He will be taking
up his new role at a time when leading members of the IoT, which deals with
all aspects of direct and indirect taxation, are repeating calls for the
government to simplify the entire UK tax system.
Dommett would appear to have the stamina necessary for such a task. His
hobby is marathon running; he has so far completed 11 - six in London alone
and three in New York.
