FT  11 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Interest rates


The trouble with the sterling money market is that it sometimes tries to be
just a little too perfect. It tried in vain to discount a base rate rise
while Labour was ahead in the polls. Yesterday it was reluctant to discount
a cut till much later in the summer.
This time, however, it may well be right. The argument that a Tory victory
would so underpin sterling that the government could quickly kick-start the
economy by cutting rates is doubly flawed. Despite yesterday's euphoria,
sterling's close of DM2.88 was nearly half a pfennig below its narrow band
range in the ERM. And with the election over, there is less political
urgency about economic recovery.
It would be reasonable to suppose that the election result will by itself
generate some recovery in consumer spending. The risk is that, like the
response to last year's Gulf victory, the momentum might fizzle out after a
month or two as more intractable problems such as the property market
resurface.
The best policy prescription might be to wait till that point is reached
before using any limited scope for a rate cut.
Granted, yesterday's inflation figures again confirmed that the UK's current
performance is better than that of Germany. However, base rates are only
0.75 percentage points above the Lombard rate. The UK cannot easily sustain
more than a half point cut until the Bundesbank moves lower too.
The chances of that are slim while German money supply growth is three
percentage points outside its target and the wage round has not been
satisfactorily concluded. And unless sterling were at or around its DM2.95
central rate, trying to buck the German trend would look as though the
Government's ERM commitment was taking second place.
