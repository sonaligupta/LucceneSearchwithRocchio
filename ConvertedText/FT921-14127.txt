FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Alcoa tumbles 51% to ADollars
381m

ALCOA of Australia, the aluminium, alumina and gold producer, yesterday
reported a 51 per cent drop in net profits to ADollars 381m (USDollars 282m)
for the year to the end of December.
It said the fall was caused by lower prices for alumina, aluminium ingots
and gold, higher raw material costs, and the introduction of corporate
taxation on gold mining operations.
Much of the decline occurred in the final quarter, when net profits fell to
ADollars 77.8m, compared with ADollars 189.5m the previous year. Sales for
the year fell by 16 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn.
The company said its alumina and aluminium facilities operated at record
levels throughout the year. However, gold production fell from 183,000
tonnes to 167,000 tonnes, partly because of lower recovery grades.
The directors said the result was 'satisfactory' considering the difficult
market conditions. However, they warned the current year would be
'challenging' as market conditions continued to deteriorate.
Alcoa is 51 per cent owned by the Alumina Company of America and 49 per cent
by Western Mining Corporation, the Australian resources group.
The directors earlier declared a fully-franked final dividend of 24.1 cents
a share, equivalent to a return of ADollars 100m to shareholders.
