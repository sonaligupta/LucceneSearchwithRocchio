FT  13 NOV 92 / Observer: Under dogs


The South African Parliamentary XV versus a combined House of Lords and
Commons XV - kick-off 10.30 at Richmond College - should be an entertaining
curtain-raiser before tomorrow's Anglo-Boer clash at Twickenham.
Of course, there won't be any blacks in the South African squad - they still
aren't represented in parliament - but it is otherwise a commendably
catholic affair. Even the ANC, through Rob Haswell, MP for Pietermaritzburg
South, is represented. Nic Koornhoff, MP for Swellendam, says the spirit in
the team is good - better than in parliament.
'The only area in which we might have a few problems is on the right wing.
There were no volunteers from the Conservative Party,' quips Koornhoff.
As with the Twickenham battle, the South Africans face an uphill struggle.
Their best hope would seem to lie in spiriting coach Theuns Stoffberg, a
formidable Springbok loose forward of recent years, onto the pitch.
