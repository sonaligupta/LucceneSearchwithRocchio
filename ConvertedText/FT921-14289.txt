FT  16 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Public outcry over Pounds 0.6m for former
Granada chief


   By GARY MEAD


GRANADA Group, the television and leisure group, received a welter of
telephone calls yesterday from outsiders concerned about payments to one
former and one current director revealed in its latest annual report.
The company attempted to play down the furore over a Pounds 579,550 payment
to Mr Derek Lewis, the group's former chief executive who resigned last
September.
With Mr Lewis leaving soon after the start of a three-year contract paying
him some Pounds 200,000 annually, the compensation package mostly
represented fulfilment of the contract.
Defenders of Mr Lewis said yesterday that Granada's successful Pounds 9m bid
for the north-west television franchise in October owed much to him.
The annual report also revealed that Mr David Plowright, the current
chairman of Granada TV, had exercised his right to purchase a house in
Cheshire previously owned by the company. He paid just over Pounds 81,000,
against an estimated market value of some Pounds 400,000. Granada TV granted
Mr Plowright the option at a price equalling Granada's costs.
