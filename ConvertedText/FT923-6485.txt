FT  24 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Midland Bank to lose creator of Vector
account


   By DAVID BARCHARD


MR Kevin Gavaghan, the man who invented Vector, Meridian and Orchard,
Midland Bank's branded current accounts, is to leave the bank at the end of
September after seven years.
Mr Gavaghan, the best-known advocate of strong branding for high-street
banking products, said at the weekend that he had decided to move out of
banking and back into mainstream retailing services.
His departure from Midland comes amid the restructuring of the bank in the
wake of its takeover by Hongkong Bank.
Mr Gavaghan became Midland's marketing director in 1987, having worked
earlier in Thomas Cook, Marks and Spencer, and the Burton Group.
He attracted immediate attention across the industry by saying his
department resembled Procter and Gamble rather than a clearing bank.
By 1989, the branded current accounts which he had designed were picking up
70,000 customers a week, but when the recession began, financial services
designed specially for yuppies and jet-setters lost their appeal and the
branded accounts were quietly jettisoned.
He said he hoped his chief legacy at Midland would be increased awareness
that different groups of customers have different needs.
'I have no regrets. I could not have been in banking at a more interesting
time but I am not sure that I want to be in banking in the near future,' Mr
Gavaghan said. He declined to comment on whether he was being given
compensation for leaving.
