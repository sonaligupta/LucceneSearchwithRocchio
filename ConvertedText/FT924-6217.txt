FT  23 NOV 92 / Germany offers Hungary free military spare parts


   By NICHOLAS DENTON

GERMANY will give Hungary free military spare parts from the former East
German army, it said at the weekend, in spite of concerns that such
deliveries might fuel tension. Mr Bernd Wilz, state secretary at the German
Defence Ministry, said the equipment was necessary so as not to leave
Hungary 'undefended'.
Bonn's decision comes after much hesitation and nervousness that military
support for Hungary, which borders the warring Yugoslav successor states,
might infringe Germany's rules against providing arms to areas of crisis.
Mr Wilz emphasised that Germany would not supply lethal equipment, and Mr
Erno Raffay, his Hungarian counterpart, denied that the announcement marked
a Hungarian military build-up. But the announcement closely follows a visit
to Budapest by Mr Boris Yeltsin during which the Russian president approved
the delivery of Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m) in supplies of military spares
and air-defence equipment to Hungary in partial repayment for Russia's trade
debt of more than Dollars 2bn.
The latest arms deals reflect an attempt by Budapest to maintain military
strength while a budgetary crisis precludes higher military spending. The
effort to shore up the armed forces comes against the background of
deteriorating relations with neighbouring Slovakia, Romania and Serbia,
which all contain large Hungarian ethnic minorities.
