FT  21 DEC 92 / Construction Contracts: Birmingham rail development plan


The Passenger Transport Authority has accepted tenders totalling Pounds 14m
to carry out civil engineering work on a new cross city rail link.
TRAFALGAR HOUSE CONSTRUCTION has been awarded a contract worth Pounds 7.7m
to carry out bridgework and prepare the track formation for the four mile
rail route from Birmingham Snow Hill to Smethwick. KIER CONSTRUCTION, MOWLEM
(MIDLANDS) and AMEC CIVIL ENGINEERING have won the contracts to build new
stations at the Jewelley Quarter (Pounds 2m), the Hawthorns (Pounds 1.5m)
and Smethwick Galton Bridge station (Pounds 2.9m) respectively.
Contracts to carry out track, signalling and associated works will be let at
a later date.
The Pounds 23m project will create a Stourbridge/Worcester to Stratford
/Leamington cross city link via Snow Hill and Moor Street. The Transport
Authority is using Pounds 15m of its own capital receipts, backed by a
Pounds 5m European Community grant and Pounds 3m from Regional Railways to
finance the project.
With an extra 40,000 passengers a week expected to be attracted by the link,
extra passenger income means that the scheme will pay for itself within 15
years. The project will link the Jewellery Quarter and West Bromwich to the
rail network and improve reliability for Stourbridge commuters.
It will also ease capacity problems on the Wolverhampton/New Street line, so
that plans for a new station to serve the National Indoor Arena and ICC can
be developed. The link is expected to be open by summer 1995.
