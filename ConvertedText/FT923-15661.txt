FT  01 JUL 92 / International Company News: Waste Management sees earnings
rise


   By BARBARA DURR


   CHICAGO


WASTE Management, the leading US waste services company, expects
second-quarter earnings to increase by about 23 cents a share to a total of
about 67 cents.
This result reflects gains of an initial public offering of shares by Waste
Management International and some special charges.
Excluding these gains and special charges, the company expects that
second-quarter earnings from operations will be in the range of 43 cents to
45 cents per share. These represent a 10 to 15 per cent improvement over the
39 cents a share of a year ago.
The Chicago-based company expects to record a non-taxable gain of about
Dollars 240m, before minority interest, from the offering by Waste
Management International, the company created to own virtually all waste
operations outside North America.
Waste Management International is 56 per cent owned by Waste Management, 12
per cent each by Chemical Waste and Wheelabrator Tech-nologies - both Waste
Management subsidiaries - and 20 per cent by shareholders.
The special charges include Dollars 96m, after tax, relating primarily to a
revaluation of the company's medical waste business and to charges on two
Chemical Waste incinerators.
The company will also take a one-time, after-tax charge of Dollars 71m for
adoption of two new accounting standards.
These charges will not affect second-quarter results, but will appear in the
earnings for the six-month period ending June 30, the company said. They are
excluded from the 23 cent per share gain for the second quarter.
