FT  12 MAR 93 / Cost of hospital criticised


   By RALPH ATKINS


MPs ATTACKED the Treasury yesterday for failing to control the construction
of the Pounds 230m Chelsea and Westminster hospital. A damning report
complained of cost overruns, delays, poor management and big losses caused
by the property slump.
The cross-party Public Accounts Committee says the National Health Service
should 'take a more cautious approach on projects which rely on the property
market to fund developments'. Problems over the hospital have led to 24
other projects being postponned or cancelled.
The report expresses 'surprise' that NHS managers did not take account of
the rising number of surplus hospital beds in London and surrounding areas.
The hospital was meant to be funded by the sale of surplus sites as part of
a rationalisation exercise by the North West Thames Regional Health
Authority. Instead, there is a Pounds 100m gap between expected total costs
and sale proceeds.
The MPs say they expect the NHS management executive 'to take prompt action
to establish who was responsible for the delays in construction and
consequent overrun in completing the project and to seek compensation for
the financial consequences for the NHS'.
