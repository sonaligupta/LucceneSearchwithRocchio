FT  15 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tecs - not so easy, not so bad (2)


   From Mr ROGER YOUNG


Sir, Your report laments the departure of so many chief executives of the
new Tecs. More than a third are said to have resigned or been sacked since
Tecs were established four years ago. The high turnover is ascribed to
failures in the recruitment policy of Tec boards.
Surely it is more worthy of comment that two-thirds of incumbents are still
in their posts four years later? This degree of stability is rare within the
private sector: the same edition of the paper notes the departure of two
American retailers from the top of UK companies within eight and a half
months and two and a half years. Our research, tracking the career moves of
more than 1,000 managers over 10 years, has shown that the average span of a
management job is close to three years: four years is a long time in
management.
