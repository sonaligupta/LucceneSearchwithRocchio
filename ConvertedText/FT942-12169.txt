FT  30 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&A: A claim from abroad?


My bachelor son works in Luxembourg. His salary is paid in local currency
and is taxed locally. He also has investments in the UK. These include
building society interest, which is paid gross (he has signed form R85), and
shares from which dividends are received net. These amount to about Pounds
1,500 gross a year and tax of Pounds 300 is deducted.
Since he does not complete UK income tax returns, he is not claiming back
the Pounds 300. But is he entitled to the single person's allowance (in
which case it would be worth his while to claim back the tax)?
Although your son probably is entitled to UK building society interest
without deduction of tax (because he is not ordinarily resident in the UK),
he was not entitled to sign form R85 (which applies only to people resident
in the UK).
If he signed by mistake, he should write at once and explain his error to
the building society. All Commonwealth citizens are entitled to a personal
allowance, regardless of whether they are UK resident. Your son should write
for a claim form to: Inland Revenue Claims Branch (International), St John's
House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, saying how far back he
wants to claim.
