FT  28 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zaire's problems make room for
cobalt competitors


   By KENNETH GOODING


The world had room for the substantial new cobalt production currently
planned, suggested the Cobalt Development Institute after reporting a 23 per
cent fall in output by its members in 1993.
Cobalt is a metal essential in some of the superalloys used by the aerospace
industry and for some motor industry products.
All of the 1993 drop, to 13,843 tonnes, was accounted for by Gecamines, the
state-owned producer in Zaire, once the world's biggest producer but whose
output has dwindled as the country has sunk into political chaos. The
institute said that Gecamines' output last year was 2,200 tonnes, down from
8,625 tonnes in 1992. In 1987 the company produced about 12,000 tonnes.
The other six producer-members of the institute have been increasing output
 -by 17 per cent in the past five years to 11,643 tonnes. Outokumpu of
Finland and Sherritt of Canada each have nearly doubled production in that
time to 2,200 tonnes and 1,218 tonnes respectively.
The institute estimated that, when non-members and other sources were
included, 17,263 tonnes of new cobalt was available in the western world
last year, down from 22,781 tonnes in 1992. With 3,000 tonnes left in stock
at the end of 1992, the institute said it would be safe to assume that
20,260 tonnes was available. This was in line with demand (outside Russia),
which it estimated at 19,200 tonnes.
The institute pointed out that 'the underlying trend of rapidly falling
output from Zaire asserted itself and the price going into 1994 effectively
doubled over the Christmas period.'
It added: 'There is much new cobalt production, in embryo or close to
hatching stage, in various parts of the world. They should be born into a
receptive world.'
