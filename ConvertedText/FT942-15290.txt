FT  15 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow relieved after scare over
Mideast

   NEW YORK


Wall Street
US stocks were mixed yesterday after recovering from a scare over US-Iraqi
relations and a early round of program selling, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 1.78 better at 3,663.25, while the more
broadly based Standard & Poor's 500 edged 0.12 higher to 446.38. In the
secondary markets, the American SE composite dipped 0.63 to 437.32, and the
Nasdaq composite 0.07 to 727.31.
Stocks stumbled out of the opening gate, with investors rattled by erroneous
reports of hostile fire downing two US helicopters in northern Iraq. When it
emerged that the aircraft were shot down accidently by US forces, the market
reversed course and pushed into positive territory.
A parallel recovery by the US Treasury market was a help, although bonds
slipped once again. A small gain in weekly claims for state unemployment
benefit was no impediment. Most equity investors, however, were sitting pat
ahead of today's important data on industrial production and capacity
utilisation.
As the afternoon began, the blue chips started to recede from their peak of
12 points up. Positioning ahead today's 'double witching' expiration of
stock options was responsible for some of the volatililty.
Among individual issues, Chevron outperformed the Dow industrials thanks to
an upgrading by Salomon Brothers. The stock climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars
88 1/2 .
On the Nasdaq, technology issues stablised after sharp declines in the
previous two sessions. Adobe Systems jumped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 24 1/4
, and Wellfleet gained Dollars 1 1/2 to 65.
Canada
Toronto closed mixed in moderate trading, as slumping forest-products stocks
offset modest advances in most other sectors.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 6.05 points, or 0.14 per cent, to close at
4,254.85, but declining issues outnumbered advances 428 to 320. Volume was
63.20m compared with Wednesday's 63.73m. Trading value fell to CDollars
791.7m compared with CDollars 820.5m.
Mexico
The bolsa overcame early losses and closed with a slight gain on buying by
local investors.
The key IPC index of 36 leading stocks ended up 6.61 points, or 0.3 per
cent, at 2,206.51 on a volume of 68.5m shares.
Traders said local investors started buying late in the day after the index
fell below 2,200.
