FT  24 NOV 92 / London Tube strike called off


   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff


RAIL UNION leaders agreed to call off strike action on London's Tube network
yesterday, 12 hours before it was due to start.
Both sides claimed victory, but London Underground will now press ahead with
introducing flexible working practices and restructured pay scales, as the
RMT rail union, which represents 11,000 of the network's 21,000 workforce,
appeared to climb down over the planned overhaul of pay and conditions.
The action was called off after a special meeting of the RMT's left-leaning
ruling executive committee, which accepted a formula agreed between
management and union leaders during 25 hours of talks with the Acas
conciliation service at the weekend.
The RMT said it had secured important commitments from the company, although
it accepted that the management had not made concessions on the main changes
to pay and conditions. London Underground said its position had not shifted.
Under the plan, all 21,000 employees will switch to salaried status, with 30
per cent losing financially after three years and 70 per cent gaining
immediately. About 5,000 jobs will be shed in the next two to three years.
The link between promotion and seniority will end and some workers will have
to reapply for their jobs under new training schemes. Many allowances, such
as compensation for travelling time, have been consolidated.
In 1989, strike action by rail unions and some unofficial groups forced
London Underground to abandon a less ambitious plan.
Paying tribute to Acas, Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT, said:
'London Underground claimed there was no place for Acas in the negotiations,
yet 24 hours later they were involved.'
