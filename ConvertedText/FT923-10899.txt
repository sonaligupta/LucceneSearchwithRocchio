FT  28 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses start the week on
a firmer note


   By Our Markets Staff


MOST BOURSES started the week on a firmer note but trading remained thin,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rose in quiet trading but sentiment remained nervous. The DAX
closed up 7.67 at 1,618.09 while the FAZ was down 1.58 at 638.36 at
midsession. Turnover fell to DM4.2bn from DM4.9bn.
The chemical and car sectors were active. A recommendation by Salomon
Brothers yesterday to switch out of Bayer into BASF had no affect on the
shares with Bayer up DM3.80 at DM263.20 and BASF up DM4.90 at DM218. The
broker argues for the switch on the grounds that the outlook for plastics
has improved while 'prospects for pharmaceuticals have been tainted by
government cost-cutting plans'.
Volkswagen advanced DM5.70 or 1.6 per cent to DM354.50 while Porsche was one
of the day's losers, down DM4 to DM500. Daimler, whose Dasa division
announced its acquisition of Dutch aircraft maker Fokker on Friday, put on
DM3 to DM701.
With half-year results due in the next couple of weeks, the banking sector
began to reflect market uncertainty. Commerzbank lost DM1 to DM237, Deutsche
Bank was up DM3 to DM645.50 and Dresdner gained DM1 to DM325.
AMSTERDAM fell following the announcement after Friday's close that
agreement had been reached on Dasa's takeover of Fokker. The CBS Tendency
index lost 0.7 to 114.6.
The aircraft manufacturer dropped to a year's low of Fl 26.40 before
improving slightly to close down Fl 1.10 or 3.8 per cent to Fl 27.50. Some
analysts said minority shareholders were selling out now that Dasa no longer
had to buy shares in the market to accumulate a stake.
The chemical groups Akzo and DSM weakened on forecasts of disappointing half
year results from DSM on Thursday. Akzo was down Fl 2.40 at Fl 133.40 while
DSM shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 97.70. Elsewhere Nedlloyd sank to a year's low, off
80 cents at Fl 44.10 and the weaker dollar took Fl 2.40 off Unilever to Fl
177.60.
PARIS rose on the first day of the new account as dealers bought stocks
which had been out of favour in the previous trading period. LVMH jumped
FFr153 or 4.5 per cent to FFr3,590 in low volume of 9,170 and Suez added
FFr7 to FFr261. The CAC 40 index added 20.73 to 1,755.35 in thin turnover of
FFr1.2bn.
BSN remained weak, losing FFr10 to FFr1,033 following news last week that
the food company planned to limit voting rights. The stock was also weak on
concerns that BSN might not be able to consolidate Volvic into this year's
accounts. Euro Disney remained on its downward trend, falling FFr1.40 to
FFr94.75.
MILAN was lifted off the day's lows as prices recovered slightly in the
after-market but dealers said the outlook remained bearish. The Comit index
fell 7.98 to 398.38 in turnover estimated at around L85bn after Friday's
L102.4bn.
Blue chips bore the brunt of the day's fall, with Fiat losing L146 or 3.2
per cent to L4,409 following Friday's news of the arrest of a senior
executive at one of its subsidiaries in connection with the Milan bribery
scandal.
Banks were mostly weaker but San Paolo stood L10 higher at L10,050 after
reporting that gross operating profit rose 25 per cent in the first half.
ISTANBUL leapt 3.7 per cent as hopes of lower bank deposit rates were
revived by a newspaper report that Turkey's biggest state-run bank, Ziraat,
was planning a rate cut. The 75-share index closed at 4,210.05, up 150.33.
ZURICH was quiet with the SMI index closing up 5.1 at 1,761.9. The banking
sector advanced following last week's cut in interest rates. Union Bank
bearers rose SFr3 to SFr687.
STOCKHOLM recovered in thin trading, as the Affarsvarlden General index rose
7.1 to 841.8 as turnover slipped to SKr159m from SKr219m. OSLO's all-share
index rose 2.26 to 380.30 in low turnover of NKr118.8m, in spite of
disappointing first-half results from Norsk Hydro which fell NKr2.5 to
NKr146.5. VIENNA hit another new low, the 18-share ATX index ended 5.29 down
at 765.77.
