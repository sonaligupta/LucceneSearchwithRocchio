The 38-member Commonwealth observer group yesterday called on the Kenyan
government for 'more effective action' to curb the violence marring the
run-up to the country's first multi-party general election in 26 years on
December 29, writes Michael Holman in Nairobi.
It was the group's third warning in a week.
