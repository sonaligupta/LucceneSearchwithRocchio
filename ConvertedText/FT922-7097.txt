FT  20 MAY 92 / Hungary stokes bitter row over Danube dam

   BUDAPEST, PRAGUE


HUNGARY said yesterday it was officially pulling out of the controversial
Danube hydro-electric scheme, fuelling its fierce row with Czechoslovakia.
Budapest said it was abrogating the 1977 treaty governing construction of
the power plant at Bos-Gabcikovo, and was considering turning to the
European Community, the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe
or the international court in The Hague if the Czechoslovaks did not stop
building.
Environmentalists regard the project as a communist monstrosity, which will
force much of the flow into a 17km-long elevated channel. They claim that
the project will damage water supply and destroy wetlands.
Slovakia says the work - which is mostly on its side of the border - is 90
per cent complete and that Korunas 20bn (Pounds 390m) has been spent.
The issue adds another volatile ingredient to the complicated tensions
between Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. As Slovakia approaches
elections which are likely to produce a more nationalist government,
Hungarian nervousness about the 800,000 fellow nationals there is mounting
along with Czech fears of the break-up of the Czechoslovak federation.
Hungary's move follows three years of bitter arguments over the project
since Budapest halted its part of the construction in 1989.
The uncompromising tone adopted by both Hungary and Czechoslovakia yesterday
underlines the fact that neither side can afford to give in for domestic
political reasons.
In Hungary, the democratic opposition which toppled the former regime was
born out of hostility to the dam.
Last week, Mr Villiam Oberhauser, Slovak minister of forest and water
management, said too much damage had been done to reverse the situation
ecologically, while the plant would produce Kcs6bn of power a year for
Slovakia.
