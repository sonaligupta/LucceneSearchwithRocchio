FT  27 MAY 93 / International Company News: Japan's machine makers buoyed by
shipbuilding

RESULTS AT Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the
Japanese machinery makers, were buoyed last year by an increase in sales by
their shipbuilding divisions, which had been a burden for both companies
over the past decade.
Most Japanese machinery makers are reporting sharp falls in sales, but MHI's
sales expanded by 0.4 per cent to a record Y2,493bn (Dollars 22.8bn), while
pre-tax profit was 9.5 per cent lower at Y140.74bn. At KHI, sales were 2.3
per cent higher at Y952.9bn and profit rose 10.7 per cent to Y22.6bn.
Hitachi Zosen, a smaller company more reliant on shipbuilding, which
accounts for 54 per cent of its sales, reported a 41.3 per cent surge in
pre-tax profit to Y17.4bn on sales up 14.6 per cent to Y358.5bn.
Japan's heavy industrial companies have reduced the capacity of their
shipbuilding operations and diversified into new business, but strong demand
in 1990 and 1991 has left them with full order books and reduced
competition.
Orders slowed last year, but most still have a backlog. Mitsubishi's
shipbuilding and steel structures division sales rose 25.3 per cent;
machinery sales were 4.3 per cent lower, and aircraft and special vehicles
were down 10.5 per cent.
For the current year, MHI expects sales and profits to be about the same and
made no specific forecasts. However, orders for new vessels were down 18.6
per cent last year, though power system orders gained 30 per cent.
Kawasaki's ship sales were 43 per cent higher, though new orders slumped 60
per cent. Rolling stock sales were up 15.6 per cent while sales of aerospace
equipment were just 0.3 per cent higher.
Both companies fear that the yen will put their export divisions under
increased pressure in coming months, but Kawasaki still expects sales to
grow to Y980bn, while pre-tax profit is forecast to slip to Y18bn.
