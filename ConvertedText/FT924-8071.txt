FT  13 NOV 92 / Honecker trial opens


   By LESLIE COLITT


MR ERICH HONECKER, the ailing 80-year-old former East German leader, checks
his watch at the opening in Berlin of his trial and that of five senior
aides on manslaughter charges arising from the fatal border shootings of
East Germans trying to flee to the west, writes Leslie Colitt. The
proceedings barely began, however, when the trial was adjourned until next
Monday because a co-defendant, Mr Willi Stoph, the 78-year-old ex-prime
minister, was absent suffering from a heart ailment.
