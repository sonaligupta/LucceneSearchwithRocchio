FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bad move for transport


   From Mr RICHARD P BOTWOOD


Sir, There is speculation that in his November Budget the chancellor may
seek to introduce VAT at some level on public transport fares. We hope this
is false.
Much of public transport is perceived to be expensive at the point of use
and this is a deterrent to its greater use. To make this perception more of
a reality by a directly imposed new tax must be contrary to what we
understand is the government's strategy for relieving congestion on the
roads. It would be a particularly ill-conceived action should any additional
revenue raised from VAT not be 'ring fenced' for the development of improved
public transport services and infrastructure.
The whole subject of taxes on transport coupled with the possibility in
future of road tolls, merits an overall review which this institute will now
be undertaking.
