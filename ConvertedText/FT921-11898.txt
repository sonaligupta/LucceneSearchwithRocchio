FT  29 JAN 92 / South African banks to merge


   By PHILIP GAWITH

ABSA and Bankorp, two of South Africa's largest banks, have announced they
are to merge their businesses to create a bank with assets of more than
R80bn (Pounds 15.9bn).
ABSA, the banking interest of Rembrandt, the South African tobacco-based
conglomerate, will acquire the entire issued share capital of Bankorp, the
banking arm of the Sanlam insur-ance group, at 312.5 cents per share.
This is a premium over Bankorp's closing price yesterday of 295 cents, but a
discount to the share's 1991 net asset value of 323 cents.
The total purchase price of R1.3bn will be financed through the issue of an
additional 116.5m shares in ABSA at R11.25 per share.
Bankorp shareholders will receive 100 ABSA shares for every 360 shares in
Bankorp.
The merger represents a shake-out at the top of the country's banking tree,
removing the weakest of the big five - Bankorp - and leaving ABSA larger
than any other bank.
Sanlam, through its investment arm Sankorp, owns 86 per cent of Bankorp and
this share will be reduced to 21 per cent in the enlarged ABSA.
It is envisaged that in due course Sankorp and Universa (a company owned 40
per cent by Financial Securities Limited, part of the Rembrandt group; 40
per cent by the Mines Pension Funds; and 20 per cent by Sage Financial
Services) will have equal interests of 25 per cent in ABSA.
The main trading divisions of Bankorp, such as TrustBank, Senbank and
Bankfin will continue trading under their existing names.
Two of the most important potential benefits for ABSA of the merger are a
more balanced market representation - ABSA is strong in home loans and
Bankorp in instalment sales and corporate markets - and a more
representative outlet structure.
Mr Piet Liebenberg, executive chairman of Bankorp, will become a
vice-chairman and deputy chief executive of ABSA.
Although the deal came as a surprise, analysts have long believed that it
was only a matter of time before Bankorp was swallowed up by one of the
other large banks.
Bankorp paid a heavy price for two years of 40 per cent asset growth in 1989
and 1990, culminating in write-offs of R386.5m in 1990.
