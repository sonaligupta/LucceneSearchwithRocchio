FT  23 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: France


The economic news emerging from France will keep business leaders happy on
their annual migration to the beach. May's strong industrial production
figures are evidence of a broadening and accelerating recovery. Mr Edmond
Alphandery, the economy minister, suggests French GDP growth might rise to 2
per cent this year compared with the government's previous forecast of 1.4
per cent. That is clearly good news for corporate France. The bounce in the
CAC 40 in July reflects as much.
But global investment flows will be just as critical for the direction of
the Paris bourse. Even though the UK and French economies have been out of
synch, it is significant that their stock markets have moved closely in
line, as the accompanying chart shows. Like the UK, worries about the pace
of recovery have unnerved international bond investors. With long bond
yields in France rising to 7.3 per cent and inflation falling to 1.5 per
cent, the economy may be squeezed again. The French room for manoeuvre on
short term rates has been stymied by the Bundesbank's latest moves.
Those high real interest rates may also point to a developing struggle for
capital between private and public sectors. With unemployment remaining
stubbornly high, the government's budget deficit can not be quickly cut.
Political uncertainty ahead of next year's presidential elections will add
an extra element of uncertainty. The French air traffic controllers' strike
 -disrupting the holiday migration - may presage unrest to come.
