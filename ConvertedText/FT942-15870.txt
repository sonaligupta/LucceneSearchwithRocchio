FT  13 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Daimler-Benz


Daimler-Benz's confident tone and stress on investment yesterday was a world
away from the pose an Anglo-Saxon manufacturer would strike in a similarly
sticky spot. Whether Daimler's confidence will prove justified is, however,
an open question. The company has some things going for it: an under-used
asset base offers opportunities to improve margins and raise cash from
disposals. Hard times encourage union flexibility. General Motors, Ford and
BMW have proved that it is possible to make cars in Germany at a profit.
Yet the challenges remain great. Daimler starts its overhaul of the
cost-plus manufacturing facilities, working methods and attitudes from a
long way behind the competition. The company has yet to accept that people
may not automatically pay more for a three-pointed star on their bonnets.
Its expensive diversification has been disastrous. Daimler is now struggling
with the huge investment and working capital demands of both the aerospace
and automotive industries. Shareholders will want to see positive progress
as well as fancy talk before stumping up any rights issue cash later in the
year.
