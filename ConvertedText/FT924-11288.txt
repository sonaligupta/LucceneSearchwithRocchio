FT  27 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US-Mexico row


   By FRANCES WILLIAMS


   GENEVA


The US and Mexico yesterday asked Gatt's anti-dumping committee to postpone
consideration of an independent panel ruling against US anti-dumping duties
on Mexican cement, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The panel ruled
that the US failed to comply with the procedures laid down in Gatt's
anti-dumping code, making it liable to return millions of dollars in
anti-dumping duties on Mexican cement producers. The two sides are trying to
settle the matter, and asked for a month's grace.
