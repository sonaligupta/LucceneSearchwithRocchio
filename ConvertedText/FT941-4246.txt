FT  11 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow under pressure from
declining bonds

   NEW YORK.


Wall Street
Declining bond prices once again put the US stock market under pressure,
with equities posting sizeable losses yesterday in the wake of another big
sell-off in the Treasury market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at one point had been off almost 40
points, was down a net 22.79 at 3,830.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 weakened
3.16 to 463.90, while the American SE composite slipped 2.01 to 464.78 and
the Nasdaq composite shed 3.96 to 789.09. New York SE trading volume was
369.4m shares.
For the third day in a row, early declines in bond prices prompted selling
of stocks. Yesterday, the losses on the bond market were considerable. By
late afternoon the benchmark 30-year government issue was down 1 1/4 points
and the yield had risen to 6.938 per cent.
Analysts said bonds fell because the market was worried by a decline in the
dollar and a jump in the gold price, both potentially inflationary
developments, and because bond futures prices fell sharply on derivatives
markets.
With long-term yields rising to more than 6.9 per cent, stock market
investors took fright, pushing the Dow sharply lower. Analysts said share
prices were also undermined by speculation in foreign and US markets,
particularly among futures traders, that the rapidly developing Whitewater
scandal was threatening Mr Bill Clinton's presidency.
The day's only economic news - a 32,000 increase in weekly initial
unemployment claims - had little impact on market sentiment, although the
rise in claims was larger than Wall Street had been expecting.
International Paper fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 1/2 , continuing its recent
decline in the wake of a profits warning from the company.
Cyclical shares were hit by selling. Among the biggest losers were Minnesota
Mining & Manufacturing, which receded Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 104 1/2 ,
Alcoa, with a fall of Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 73 1/8 , and General
Electric, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 104 1/2 .
Dr Pepper/Seven-Up climbed more than Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 5/8 in early
trading on a report that UK confectionery and drinks group Cadbury
Schweppes, which has a 25 per cent equity stake in the former, is interested
in acquiring the rest of the company. Cadbury, however, later poured cold
water on the suggestion, and Dr Pepper retreated to end Dollars  1/2 up at
Dollars 25 1/2 .
The stocks of bank and brokerage companies, whose earnings are likely to be
hit by rising interest rates, were mostly lower. Among banks, Citicorp lost
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 38 1/8 and Chase Manhattan Dollars  3/8 at Dollars
31 1/2 , while among brokerage stocks, Salomon dipped Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 51 3/4 and Merrill Lynch Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Spectrum Information Technology rose Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 3 7/16 after Mr John Sculley, its former chairman, dropped his
lawsuit against the company. In the same sector, Intel fell Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 70 1/8 after a California jury ruled against the company in a
copyright case.
Canada
Toronto closed flat after busy trading, with a surge among gold shares
offset by declines in most other groups.
The TSE 300 index lost 1.3 points at 4,443.2 and declines slightly exceeded
rises by 389 to 378 after volume of 100.4m shares. The golds group added 3.4
per cent as the bullion price jumped USDollars 8 an ounce to USDollars
387.35 in New York.
