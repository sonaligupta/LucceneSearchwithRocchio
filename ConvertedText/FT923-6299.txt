FT  25 AUG 92 / International Company News: Samancor falls 23.5% due to
market weakness

SAMANCOR, the integrated chrome and manganese ore and alloys producer in the
Gencor group, saw earnings fall by 23.5 per cent in the year to June on the
back of weak international commodity markets. The result was, however,
better than market expectations. .
Pre-tax income dropped to R384.4m (Dollars 138.9m) from R567.4m, including a
decline in net interest received to R49.3m from R110.8m. Attributable income
fell to R277.1m from R362.2m.
Turnover rose to R2.06bn from R1.81bn in 1991, but R449m of this increase
came from the acquisition of Middelburg Steel and Alloys' (MS&A) ferrochrome
operations, the chromite assets of the Rand Mines group and the Manganese
Metal Company (MMC). The remaining turnover was actually 11 per cent down on
1991.
Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said if conditions in world commodity
markets did not improve, the group would be 'hard pressed to maintain the
earnings announced.' Accordingly the overall dividend was being cut to 90
cents per share from 110 cents per share. Earnings per share fell to 151
cents from 216 cents.
He added that the highlight of the company's performance was its improved
cash position, with cash resources rising by R165m to R267m during the
second half of the year following a three-month closure of production
capacity.
He said this had been achieved despite the fact that Samancor had paid more
than R300m in cash for its interests in the Columbus stainless steel joint
venture and MMC.
He defended the decision to close capacity saying it had been a successful
attempt to generate cash, not an effort to squeeze supply.
