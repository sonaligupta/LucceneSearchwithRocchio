FT  13 APR 94 / Warning over pension transfers


The plans to achieve higher standards in the sale of personal pensions to
people transferring out of or leaving an occupational pension scheme do not
get to the heart of mis-selling, the Society of Pension Consultants has
warned.
The society, which represents advisers on setting up both employer and
personal pension schemes, calls for an investigation into the role of
commission payments in pension transfers and opt-outs. It also argues that
the measures put forward by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief watchdog, should include further work on calculating transfer values.
Employer-sponsored schemes should also provide information on as uniform a
basis as possible.
The society has sent its recommendations to the two committees of MPs
addressing the sale of personal pensions.
