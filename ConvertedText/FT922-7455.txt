FT  19 MAY 92 / OECD Annual Meeting: Farm surpluses expected to grow


   By PETER NORMAN


THE INDUSTRIAL world's farm surpluses will continue to grow in the medium
term unless present output-based support policies are changed, the OECD
warned yesterday.
In its latest review of efforts to reform agricultural policies, the
organisation said there had been insufficient adjustment to farm policies in
recent years, with the result that competitive conditions on international
markets continued to be distorted. Neither support for agricultural
production nor the costs carried by consumers through higher prices showed
any significant decrease last year.
Production support, as measured by an internationally standardised unit
known as the producer subsidy equivalent (PSE) totalled Dollars 177bn last
year compared with Dollars 180bn in 1990. Most of this was financed by an
implicit tax on consumers, paid through higher prices. The consumers' burden
of farm support rose to Dollars 135bn last year, when measured in
internationally standardised consumer subsidy equivalents (CSE), from
Dollars 133bn in 1990.
The OECD said total farm subsidies were much higher, however. It estimated
that total transfers to agriculture, as measured by PSEs, CSEs and other
items such as welfare payments to rural areas and support for storage of
stockpiled farm products, rose by about 5 per cent to an estimated Dollars
320bn last year.
The OECD said political impediments to reform largely explained why the
movement to cut surpluses and subsidies had made little headway in recent
years. Although the overall benefits of reform clearly outweighed the costs,
those who stood to lose opposed reform actively.
The organisation said unusual or extreme events, such as food production and
distribution problems in the former Soviet Union or famine in Africa, also
postponed farm reform. But it warned that such events were only a 'temporary
reprieve' for western policymakers. The OECD also urged governments to
ensure that growing concern about the environment or food safety was not
turned into a pretext for hindering the attack on farm subsidies and
surpluses.
