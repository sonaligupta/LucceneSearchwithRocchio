FT  07 JAN 94 / External aircraft cameras rejected


Aircraft will not be fitted with external cameras, in spite of evidence that
they could have prevented the Kegworth and Manchester air disasters which
killed 102 people.
Trials have been carried out on the cameras which would monitor engine fires
and external damage to aircraft. But the Civil Aviation Authority said
yesterday: 'We don't think there is a case for making the cameras
mandatory.'
