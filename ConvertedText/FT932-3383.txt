FT  15 JUN 93 / Austerity aimed at righting Brazil


   By CHRISTINA LAMB


   RIO DE JANEIRO


BRAZIL is to slash government spending by the equivalent of Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.8bn) as part of a last-ditch austerity plan, announced last night.
The so-called plano de verdade (truth plan) was unveiled by Mr Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, the new finance minister and the fourth person in eight
months to take the helm of the crisis-ridden Brazilian economy. The plan is
seen as the government's last chance, before the December 1994 presidential
and congressional elections, to tackle the country's soaring inflation, now
at 32 per cent a month.
The six-point plan contains none of the shocks of some of its predecessors
over the last eight years. 'I can offer no miracles,' Mr Cardoso told a news
conference in Braslia.
Instead, it seeks tighter fiscal control in an attempt to bridge an expected
Dollars 12bn budget deficit. 'It is imperative that the government set an
example by putting its house in order,' said the minister.
The Dollars 6bn cut represents a small proportion of the Dollars 240bn total
federal budget, but a large slice of what the minister called the 'tiny
parcel for new investment and running costs - unfortunately it is that which
we have had to cut.'
He pointed out that the constitution gave the government little flexibility,
most revenue being eaten by government wages, interest payments, and by
mandatory transfers to states and cities which receive 45 per cent of all
taxes.
Mr Cardoso has yet to give details of his 'budgetary diet', but said he had
chosen Dollars 6bn as the minimum necessary to balance the budget and allow
a return to growth.
Aside from the spending cuts, the minister hopes to boost revenue through a
crackdown on tax evaders, with offenders being jailed for the first time,
and through the new cheque tax still awaiting congressional approval.
