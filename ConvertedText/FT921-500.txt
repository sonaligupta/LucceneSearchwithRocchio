FT  28 MAR 92 / Weekend London: Street sculpture


   By WILLIAM PACKER


WE ARE really quite well off for sculpture on the streets of London although
too often we go past without looking. Consider Lutyens' Cenotaph in
Whitehall, discreet enough to nag away at the collective subconscious but
wonderfully elegant and dignified the moment it comes into focus; and
Landseer's Lions at the foot of Nelson's Column are still seen more as
national pets than anything. Jagger's magnificent Artillery Memorial,
marooned at Hyde Park Corner may be seen only from the bus. Best of all is
Le Sueur's small equestrian monument to Charles I that has looked down
Whitehall to the fateful Banqueting Hall ever since 1675.
With Modern Art we have done less well, though things improve when
developers commission works of art directly from the artist. 'Chalice'
(pictured above) William Pye's huge fountain sculpture for Greycoat London
Estates at 123 Buckingham Palace Road, is the spectacular fruit of just such
a collaboration.
