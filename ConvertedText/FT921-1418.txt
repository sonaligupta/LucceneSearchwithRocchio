FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Hurd gives pledge over EC finances


   By RALPH ATKINS


MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night signalled his
determination to take a tough stance in negotiations on European Community
finances if the Conservatives are re-elected, Ralph Atkins writes.
Tories knew 'how to get the best terms for Britain', he said in a speech at
Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
The Conservatives were 'committed but not uncritical' of the EC. Europe
would prosper through widening opportunities for individual citizens and
businesses, he added.
Mr Hurd deliberately focused his speech to attack what he described as
Labour's 'amazing contradictions and confusions' over Europe.
