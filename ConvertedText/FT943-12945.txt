FT  22 JUL 94 / GPs make 'little use' of freedom


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


Health authorities and GP fundholders have made little use of their freedom
under the government's health reforms to send patients to independent
hospitals, a study of the private sector shows today.
The annual Laing's Review of Private Healthcare shows that in 1992-93 only
4.9 per cent of private hospital admissions were funded by the National
Health Service.
By contrast, some independent providers are facing growing competition from
private wings of NHS hospitals. The review shows that the NHS's share of the
private market grew from 11.2 per cent in 1988 to 13.4 per cent in 1993.
More than 70 per cent of private treatment is funded by medical insurance.
In December 1993 6.68m people were covered by insurance - about the same
number as in 1990 - but the review expects growth to resume with the end of
the recession and greater price stability in the insurance market.
The value of medical insurance premiums reached an estimated Pounds 1.56bn
in 1993, with payments by insurers to hospitals, doctors and other private
healthcare providers around Pounds 1.25bn.
Mr William Laing, editor of the review, said the figures indicated that
private medical insurance was in a much stronger financial position than two
years ago, with gross margins reaching a 'historically high level' of 20 per
cent in 1993.
The British Medical Association yesterday urged the government to reconsider
proposals to introduce local pay bargaining for medical staff. Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary, responded that she wanted to proceed with the
changes 'in a manner which can command the confidence of doctors and other
staff'.
