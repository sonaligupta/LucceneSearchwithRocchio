FT  25 MAR 92 / Widespread accounting changes are proposed


   By ANDREW JACK


THE TREATMENT in accounts of pensions and leasing require substantial
revision, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales told
the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. It also called for a review of
existing standards on depreciation and consolidated accounts.
The institute said SSAP 24, the standard dealing with pensions, neglected
the balance sheet by concentrating on the profit-and-loss account. It called
for a schedule in the accounts reconciling the balance-sheet figure to the
surplus or deficit of the pension scheme. The institute said SSAP 12, which
covers depreciation, was being misinterpreted. Depreciation should be
treated as the decline in the value of an asset allocated over its period of
use, the institute explained. The idea in the present definition of the
'wearing out' of an asset should be dropped.
It says of SSAPs 1 and 14, which deal with consolidated accounts, that there
may be contradictions between accounting practice and legislation. It calls
for legal changes, especially to deal with associated undertakings.
