DCC, the Dublin-based private industrial holding company, improved pre-tax
profits by 2 per cent to IPounds 13.8m (Pounds 13.4m) for the year ending
March 31.
At the same time the company confirmed that it would seek a stock market
listing 'in the medium term'.
DCC is one of the few private Irish companies to publish full financial
statements.
The company has been built up over 16 years from a IPounds 1m venture
capital operation into a holding company with net assets now totalling
IPounds 136m, including a net cash bal-ance of IPounds 21m, by Mr Jim
Flavin, its founder and chief executive.
DCC took a majority stake in Printech and Wardell Roberts at the end of last
year, increased its holding in Fyffes to 11 per cent, and more recently
announced its intention to take a 29.9 per cent stake in Kingston Oil, the
UK recycler of waste oils.
It has invested IPounds 22m in building these and other stakes over the past
year.
Earnings per share for the year totalled 77.8p (76.5) and a dividend
increase to 11.5p (10p) is proposed.
DCC is 95 per cent-owned by institutional investors, the two largest being
the Bank of Ireland and Irish Life.
