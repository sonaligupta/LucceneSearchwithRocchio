FT  12 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Burmah advances


   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON


Burmah Castrol sprinted ahead, closing 11 firmer at 826p after the group's
preliminary results came in at the very top end of market expectations. But
it was the dividend increase, up 9 per cent on the year to 27.5p, that
caught the eye. Most analysts had been expecting a total payment of 26.5p,
with a handful of super-optimists looking for 27p.
Oil sector specialists said the company delivered a positive post-results
message to the market, hinting that the German and other European businesses
could be turning the corner and emerging from recession.
Ms Irene Himona, an oil sector analyst at Strauss Turnbull, the stockbroker,
and a long term supporter of Burmah Castrol shares, said the market had
adopted a much too bearish view of the company which, she added, should
stand at a market price/earnings ratio instead of the current 20 per cent
discount for 1994. 'Burmah Castrol is positioned to increase its dividend by
10 per cent for the next two years and still end up with dividend cover of
1.9 times,' said Ms Himona.
The pharmaceuticals area was under pressure as a spate of minor irritants
focused on Zeneca and Glaxo and reinforced the sector's precarious standing
within the London market.
Zeneca ended 5 off at 724p after the US Food and Drug Administration ordered
more stringent labelling on its breast cancer product. Although the concern
over the drug's links with cancer of the uterus were known, the move towards
tighter policing and a subsequent warning letter to doctors knocked
sentiment.
Meanwhile, Glaxo, which market's Zantac, the world's top-selling anti-ulcer
drug, suffered from the news that US company Lederle was co-promoting an
anti-ulcer treatment with SmithKline Beecham (steady at 370p). It was also
affected by the realisation that the appeal by Novopharm against Glaxo's
patent on Zantac started yesterday. Glaxo fell 6 to 598p.
Wellcome rose 14 1/2 to 561p ex-dividend after announcing details of the
streamlining of its research and development management structure, and it
was also helped by talk that NatWest Securities had upgraded forecasts.
NatWest's pharmaceuticals team was unavailable for comment. Fisons added 5
at 148p, with BZW said to have been a keen buyer.
The oil sector extended its recent strong performance, with Shell Transport
putting on another powerful display and moving up 15 further to 711p on
heavy turnover of 10m, including a block of 3.7m shares traded at 708p.
Dealers said Shell continued to respond to a batch of forecast upgrades last
week and some switching out of British Petroleum shares, which have
outperformed Shell in the recent past. BP finished only marginally higher at
374p.
Enterprise Oil was ahead 8 at 447p, after 450p, with analysts pointing out
the stock's higher leverage to crude oil prices than that of the integrated
stocks.
Vodafone was the lone poor performer in a generally strong telecoms area,
slipping 8 to 537p amid US selling and switching into BT and Cable and
Wireless. The latter, helped by improving sentiment towards Far Eastern
markets, appreciated 8 to 452p. BT was a similar amount up at 396 1/2 p.
The emerging takeover story in Hogg Group continued, with HSBC, which
acquired a 6.1 per cent stake a couple of weeks ago, adding to its holding
via purchases of Hogg shares by a number of its investment management
associates. HSBC now speaks for 7.26 per cent of Hogg's issued capital. Hogg
shares closed 4 higher at 215p.
A stock shortage was thought to have exaggerated gains in composite
insurances, where Sun Alliance was particularly strong and 11 better at
351p. Hoare Govett's buy recommendation continued to drive Prudential, which
settled 10 higher at 330p.
NatWest Securities fretted over accounting standards in the stores sector,
focusing its concern on recent revelations at Pentos. Shares in the high
street stationer slipped 1 1/2 to 32p. The broker also moved Next and Boots
on to its buy list, the latter advancing 7 to 535p, although the former
stayed at 231 1/2 p.
News of improved sales and a capital injection lifted Brown & Jackson, the
troubled discount retailer, by 1 1/2 to 4 1/2 p, with a very heavy 37m
shares changing hands.
Tesco improved 3 to 215p ahead of today's results. Profits are expected to
fall from Pounds 581m to around Pounds 530m.
Building sector stocks raced higher after a positive review of the outlook
for UK construction output published by the National Council of Building
Material Producers.
BPB moved forward 11 to 320p, Hepworth 10 to 388p and Marley 6 to 174p.
British Airways gained support from two research notes, one from Kleinwort
Benson and the other from Lehman Brothers. Both pointed out the stock's
recent underperformance as a good buying opportunity, with Kleinwort
underlining the quality of the group's recent traffic figures. BA put on 5
at 429p. BAA received support from Smith New Court and firmed 2 to 975p. The
broker also likes Associated British Ports, up 2 at 547p.
Defence group GEC improved 7 to 316p on consideration of a Sunday newspaper
article suggesting that the company was in talks with Finmeccanica, of
Italy. Also, Hoare Govett reiterated a trading buy recommendation. Just
before the close of dealing, a block of 4m shares went through the Seaq
electronic ticker at 314p.
