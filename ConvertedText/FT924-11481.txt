FT  26 OCT 92 / Unionist leaders set to quit talks


   By Our Belfast Correspondent


ULSTER'S political leaders and British and Irish ministers embark on another
round of bilateral talks early this week, knowing that both Unionist
delegations will be withdrawing from the talks before the November 16
meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference.
The Rev Ian Paisley, Democratic Unionist leader, has said his delegation
will be withdrawing in the week prior to November 16 as the secretariat
servicing the conference will be back in operation.
In Belfast at the weekend Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader,
told his party's annual conference that he also regarded the November 16
meeting as the deadline.
Mr Molyneaux said: 'As far back as three years ago, both governments agreed
to suspend the Anglo-Irish conference and secretariat for the duration of
the talks. It was clearly accepted that if and when the two governments
terminate the suspension, they thereby terminate the talks.'
Most observers feel there is little chance of Unionists and nationalists
reaching agreement in the time left.
The three strands of the talks have been taking place alongside one another.
There has been wide-ranging discussion on possible structures for devolved
government in Northern Ireland, new north-south institutions and links
between London and Dublin, but there is little sign of agreement on the
horizon.
