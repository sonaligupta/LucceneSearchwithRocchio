FT  01 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory backbencher warns of reining
in spending for 1993-94


   By DAVID OWEN


THE continuing recession will oblige ministers to rein in spending demands
for 1993-94, a Tory backbencher warned yesterday, David Owen writes.
Prefacing what promises to be a bruising public spending round, Mr John
Townend, the MP for Bridlington and chairman of the influential Tory
backbench finance committee, said ministers should be reminded that receipts
from revenues were falling.
If they did not reduce demands, the government would face 'increasing taxes
or increasing the public-sector deficit,' he said, and called for
confirmation of the commitment to 'financial rectitude'.
