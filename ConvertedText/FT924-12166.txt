FT  22 OCT 92 / Smaller charities feeling the pinch


   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent


BRITAIN'S CHARITY sector is shrinking, with public and corporate donations
down in real terms, the Charities Aid Foundation said yesterday.
The foundation's annual Charity Trends - one of the main sources of
information about the voluntary sector - shows a growing divergence between
the fortunes of a small group of large charities and the rest. Britain's 400
biggest charities increased their real income from voluntary donations by
about 6 per cent last year.
Mr Michael Brophy, the foundation's executive director, said it resulted
from their greater professionalism and disguised the 'acute difficulties
many medium-sized and smaller charities are having in keeping going'.
The report shows that the real income of the sector as a whole fell by 13.8
per cent between 1985 and 1990, after a period of regular growth during the
previous 10 years.
A study of 86 companies indicated that their giving fell in real terms by
3.8 per cent in 1990-91 and a further 1.5 per cent in 1991-92. Average
donations by individuals have increased by 60p a month since 1987 to Pounds
2 in 1990-91.
