FT  02 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: GEC


There are two ways of judging Lord Weinstock. Either he is a penny-pinching
manager, obstinately hoarding his pile of cash, or he is a grand strategist
with the rare talent of avoiding all the worst pitfalls of the defence and
consumer electronics industries. Yesterday's results may have prompted GEC
shareholders to opt for the latter view. Few indeed are the UK industrial
companies which can offer a secure dividend covered nearly twice by earnings
and more than twice by free cash-flow.
Less certain is how GEC would compare at a different stage in the economic
cycle. Its weakness remains its uncertain growth prospects. Defence markets
are shrinking. Though the damage from Germany abandoning the European
fighter aircraft project would be limited, it would still make GEC's
purchase of Ferranti look an expensive mistake. Earnings from
telecommunications will fall this year as System X winds down. Vigorous
growth in power systems also seems unlikely. One view is that GEC's
immediate hopes lie in its Pounds 876m net cash and the scope for its
consumer business to rebound as recovery takes holds. The two are mutually
exclusive, however. The consumer business would only recover in the unlikely
event that interest rates fell sharply. That leaves cash as the main driving
force behind earnings this year. In that case, GEC's yield of 5.5 per cent
compares rather badly with the average money market fund.
