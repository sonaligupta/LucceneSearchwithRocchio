FT  02 JUL 92 / Merchant of Venice appears in Rose Court


   By VANESSA HOULDER


THE MERCHANT of Venice comes today to Rose Court, the empty office block
built over the remains of the 16th-century Rose Theatre in Southwark, south
London, Vanessa Houlder writes.
The development first came to the attention of Shakespeare admirers three
years ago when some of the UK's best-known actors staged a vigil to prevent
the developers from bulldozing the theatre's remains.
That caused delay and embarrassment for the developers. Rose Court's
Shakespearean connections are now promoted as a selling point, but the
157,000 sq ft building, which belongs to PosTel, the Post Office and
Telecommunications pension fund, has been unable to attract a tenant.
In February the developers cut the asking rent from Pounds 35 to Pounds 40 a
sq ft to Pounds 25 a sq ft.
The Merchant of Venice will be performed by Theatre Set Up, a travelling
company, in association with the National Trust, for guests involved in
business, property and the arts.
The performance will mark the 400th anniversary of the rebuilding and
extension of the Rose Theatre stage by the owner and impresario Phillip
Henslowe.
