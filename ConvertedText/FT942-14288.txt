FT  21 APR 94 / Early changes to ECGD ruled out


The government has decided against changing the status of the Export Credits
Guarantee Department for at least the next three years.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said last night that
ministers had concluded, following a review, that the ECGD's status as a
separate government department remained 'best suited, in present
circumstances, to the achievement of its aims and objectives'.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Heseltine said the conclusion reflected the
continuing high level of ministerial involvement in the business of the
department, which provides export assistance.
