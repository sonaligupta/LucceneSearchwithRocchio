FT  20 APR 91 / International Company News: Swedes agree Alfa-Laval merger
deal

SWEDEN'S Competition Ombudsman yesterday approved Tetra Pak's SKr16.25bn
(Dollars 2.68bn) purchase of Alfa-Laval, which is also being investigated on
anti-competition grounds by the European Commission.
The decision came after Tetra Pak, the Swiss liquid packaging concern,
promised that Alfa-Laval, the Swedish dairy and food processing equipment
company, will operate independently in its marketing.
Where Tetra Pak and Alfa-Laval can supply similar services and machinery,
they must offer separate bids at the request of the customer.
Tetra Pak also agreed it should not make sales conditional on orders for
Alfa-Laval or vice versa.
It pledged existing products should not be changed so competitors to Tetra
Pak and Alfa-Laval would have difficulty in connecting equipment to the
systems produced by them.
In the case of dairies, for example, Alfa-Laval often supplies the equipment
for milk processing, while Tetra Pak supplies the equipment for packaging.
But the two companies told the Competition Ombudsman they would work with
competitors if a dairy chooses another processing or packaging company.
Mr Gunnar Hermansson, Competition Ombudsman, said it was unclear, however,
whether the EC would accept similar commitments from Tetra Pak in return for
approving the deal.
