FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: US insurers see Dollars 10.2bn hurricane
payout

   NEW YORK


THE US insurance industry expects to pay out Dollars 10.2bn in claims to
victims of Hurricane Andrew, which ripped through southern Florida and
Louisiana in late August.
The new estimate, released yesterday by the Property Claims Services
division of the American Insurance Service Group, an industry trade
association, represents an increase from the original assessment of Dollars
7.8bn.
Even then, Hurricane Andrew was by far the most costly catastrophe which the
US property-casualty insurance sector has faced.
Many Wall Street analysts are suggesting the scale of the losses could
prompt a turn in the US property-casualty industry cycle which would allow
insurance companies to push up rates and move closer to making underwriting
profits.
The revised estimate for the losses seems likely to support this view.
One reason for believing the insurance cycle should turn following the
Hurricane Andrew losses is that property-casualty insurers are believed to
be carrying lower levels of catastrophe reinsurance than they were a few
years ago.
Some analysts suggest perhaps 20 to 30 per cent of bill may be passed on to
reinsurers, rather than the traditional 30 to 40 per cent.
