FT  22 JUL 93 / UK Company News: PSIT shows Pounds 2m growth to Pounds 8.7m


A near-Pounds 2m advance in pre-tax profit was achieved by PSIT, the
property investor and developer, in the year to March 31.
In the UK, it concentrated on managing and upgrading existing properties and
planning for future development where the signs of recovery were more firmly
based.
Income from investment properties came to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 16.6m), and
from investment securities it was Pounds 2.15m (Pounds 2.88m). Interest
payable was Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m) and pre-tax profit Pounds 8.67m
(Pounds 6.72m).
Earnings per share worked through at 5.1p (4.04p) and the final dividend is
2.625p for a total of 4.125p (3.75p).
The value of property investments was static at Pounds 235m. UK properties
had fallen in line with the market but that was offset by increases
overseas. Net value per share rose from 140p to 142p.
