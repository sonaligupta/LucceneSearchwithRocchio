FT  27 JAN 94 / UK Company News: New rules considered for research listings


   By TIM BURT


Changes are being considered to the new listing rules for scientific
research companies less than two months after they came into force, the
Stock Exchange said yesterday.
A working party set up by the Exchange is due to meet for the first time
today amid concerns that the rules, which came into force on December 1,
place too many restrictions on research groups.
Many of Britain's newly floated bio-technology companies are understood to
regard the rules, first published in the revised Yellow Book last September,
as over-burdensome.
Although the rules enable scientific companies to raise money without a
significant trading record, a minimum time is set after flotation before
fresh capital can be raised.
Restrictions on share disposals by staff and venture capital groups have
also prompted complaints.
Acknowledging 'problems associated with the lock-in of promoters, directors
and senior employees', the Exchange said the working party would decide
whether the rules were unfair.
Led by Mr Brian Richards, chairman of British Bio-technology, the working
party is expected to review the requirement for independent reports on a
company's viability. It would also reconsider the criteria companies must
meet before they are allowed to seek a listing.
Its recommendations are not expected to be published before spring at the
earliest.
