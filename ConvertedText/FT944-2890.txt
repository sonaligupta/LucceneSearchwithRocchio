FT  15 DEC 94 / International Company News: ABB confirms Indian purchase

   NEW DELHI


ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the world's largest power engineering combine,
yesterday confirmed that it is buying control of a lossmaking Indian
boilermaker for Rs520m (Dollars 16.6m) in a move which will greatly increase
its capacity to meet demand for building power plants, writes Stafan Wagstyl
in New Delhi.
ABB is taking a 76 per cent stake in ACC-Babcock (ABL), a former private
company which came under government control after it accumulated losses and
sought legal protection from bankruptcy.
The remaining 24 per cent of the equity will stay in the hands of the
government and of minority shareholders.
The government's Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, the body
which nurses ailing companies, has approved the deal.
While the purchase price is modest, reflecting ABL's poor recent financial
record, the investment marks an increase in ABB's commitment to India
because the European company will take on ABL's 5,200 staff, doubling its
total payroll in the country to 10,000.
Also, ABB plans to modernise ABL's equipment and introduce new technology.
ABB said the acquisition would allow the group to serve the growing Indian
market for industrial and power station boilers.
ABL's products would complement ABB's existing output of turbines and
generators.
