FT  15 NOV 93 / Observer: Hiring time


Unemployment in Europe must have reached serious proportions when Germany's
physicians start phoning the Bundesbank for work. The German central bank's
switchboard has been jammed in recent weeks by job-hunters, including at
least one doctor, hoping to get one of the 200 jobs at the European Monetary
Institute, Buba's new neighbour.
Observer does not want to dash hopes but prospects don't sound too
promising. Initially, the core of the EMI staff will be drawn from the
Basle-based secretariat of EC central bank governors. It already operates a
number of working groups - on a future European bank note and on EC payment
systems, for instance - staffed by delegates from European central banks,
and these are likely to transfer to Frankfurt. But when the EMI needs more
full-timers it knows where to look.
Not all should despair, though, because the secretariat is currently paid
top whack salaries by the Bank for International Settlements. So some
candidates may opt to stay behind in Basle rather than take a cut in their
standard of living by moving to Frankfurt. In any event, aspiring EMI
bankers are ill-advised to call Buba, thereby reminding it of its eventual
demise. CVs to EMI president Alexandre Lamfalussy at the BIS in Basle,
please.
