FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Kunick back on dividend list with 0.5p


   By GEOFF DYER


Kunick, the leisure group which floated its UK nursing homes business
earlier this year, is to pay its first dividend for three years after
announcing an 86 per cent increase in annual profits.
The proposed dividend is 0.5p. Turnover for the 53 weeks to September 30 was
flat at Pounds 95.2m (Pounds 94.1m) but pre-tax profits jumped to Pounds
8.98m (Pounds 4.84m). Earnings per share, after exceptional items, were
0.82p (0.13p).
Operating profit on continuing operations was up 28 per cent at Pounds 7.66m
(Pounds 6m).
The leisure division increased operating profit by 27 per cent to Pounds
5.65m (Pounds 4.43m) after an efficiency programme at Bell Fruit Services
and the successful introduction of AWP machines, which issue prizes such as
watches. Four new entertainment centres for the 18-30 age group will be
opened in 1995.
