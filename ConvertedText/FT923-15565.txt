FT  01 JUL 92 / Observer: Breakfast serial


Meanwhile, it's good to see that David Frost, that other well-known
transatlantic media star, has not wasted much time finding a new Sunday
morning TV perch for himself.
Having been dumped, rather stupidly, by the new owners of the ITV breakfast
TV franchise, Frost has taken a big pay cut and defected to the state-owned
channel. He switches on January 3.
His new programme - Sunday Breakfast with David Frost - will fill an obvious
gap in the BBC's coverage. But it may upset some of the Beeb's panjandrums
to find that Lady Thatcher and Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, two of the
corporation's sterner critics, think Frost's Sunday morning current affairs
show is the best around.
