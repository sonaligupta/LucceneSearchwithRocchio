FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible to establish ADR programme
in early 1993


   By RICHARD GOURLAY


MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the carbon, ceramics and speciality materials company, is
to establish an American Depositary Receipt programme early next year.
The issue is likely to be made through the Bank of New York and will allow
certain institutional investors and employees to hold the securities.
Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group is unlikely to extend the
programme beyond the first phase at this stage and would therefore not be
forced to move to full quarterly reporting.
The ADR programme will put managers of Morgan Crucible's 30 US operations in
closer contact with the group, which at the last half-year derived 38 per
cent of sales from North America. Only 16 per cent of group sales were in
the UK.
The North American operation is producing a varied performance. Growth is
beginning to accelerate in parts of the thermal ceramics division through
sales of new products, such as filters for safety air bags in cars.
Mr Farmer believes such new products should soon begin to kick start what
has become a mature business with falling operating profits.
Sales from carbon activities are supported from the substantial increase in
the number of electric motors required in new cars - each requiring
commutators and brushes. However, the group's National Electric Carbon
subsidiary has been hit by recession and has been less successful moving
into new markets.
In technical ceramics, growth from new areas, such as biomedical products,
was almost offset by a decline in traditional areas, including provision of
materials for white goods.
