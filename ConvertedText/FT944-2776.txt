FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Record revenues behind 43% leap at Daily
Mail


   By RAYMOND SNODDY


Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail and the Evening
Standard, produced record revenues and trading profits despite the newspaper
price cutting wars.
The performance of its newspapers, with both Daily Mail and Evening Standard
classified advertising particularly strong, helped the Daily Mail and
General Trust to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.1m in the year to October 2 -
a 43 per cent rise on the previous Pounds 64.4m.
Trading profit increased 18 per cent to Pounds 97.6m. The pre-tax result was
after exceptional losses of Pounds 16.1m for provisions set against
investments in the Whittle partnerships in the US, but included a Pounds
15.9m surplus from Euromoney's Pounds 23.1m placing of shares to
institutions in May. Although DMGT sold no shares, its Euromoney stake fell
from 74.7 per cent to 70.3 per cent.
Earnings per share were 58.9p (46.8p). The company recommended a final
dividend of 12.5p (adjusted 11.2p) making a total of 16.5p (adjusted 14.8p).
Mr Peter Williams, finance director, said yesterday that DMGT was delighted
by the performance of the main group newspapers. 'It's almost a surprise to
ourselves.'
Advertising revenue rose by 14 per cent and there was also a 'sharp increase
in profit' at Northcliffe Newspapers, the regional group.
The board, led by Lord Rothermere, did, however, warn that while the group's
UK businesses continued to experience improving advertising markets, the
national newspaper sales market continued to be very competitive and a sharp
increase in newsprint prices was expected.
Mr David Forster, media analyst at Smith New Court, the stockbrokers, said
DMGT had produced 'a really rather good set of results'. Smith New Court was
now looking for profits of Pounds 103m and 62.3p earnings in the current
year and Pounds 124m profits and 75.8p earnings in 1995-96.
Other ventures such as Channel One, the London News Channel and Collegeview,
a US-based information service for college leavers, remained in loss because
of start-up costs.
Associates such as Teletext, Westcountry, the ITV company, the GWR
commercial radio group and the Bristol Evening Post all had improved
results.
The purchase of the Nottingham Evening Post is due to be completed in
January.
DMGT A shares slipped 2p to 978p.
