FT  17 JAN 92 / International Company News: Expected losses at Secpac cast
new light on merger


   By ALAN FRIEDMAN


   NEW YORK


FOURTH-QUARTER figures from Bank of America and Security Pacific yesterday
underscored the degree to which the planned Dollars 4.2bn merger of the two
California banks - the biggest in US history - is in many respects a rescue
of the latter by Bank of America.
While the San Francisco-based Bank of America reported annual net profits of
more than Dollars 1bn for the third year running, the Los Angeles-based
Security Pacific said that it expected to report a Dollars 400m
fourth-quarter deficit that would result in a loss for the year of Dollars
765m.
Security Pacific, which began selling off many of its non-US holdings even
before the merger was announced last summer, achieved a Dollars 161.3m net
profit in 1990.
The bank said its fourth-quarter results would include Dollars 730m of bad
debt provisions - Dollars 180m more than the anticipated fourth-quarter loan
losses of Dollars 550m.
Secpac's fourth quarter would include a Dollars 65m writedown of the bank's
investment in Hoare Govett, the UK broker.
This reflected a decision to sell the business rather than pursue a partial
management buy-out of Hoare Govett, the bank said.
Mr Robert Smith, Secpac's chairman, said the results 'continue to reflect
adverse economic conditions in the principal markets we serve, as well as
further strengthening of the reserve for credit losses'.
Mr Smith said he had been advised by Bank of America that the fourth-quarter
losses and loan provisions at Secpac 'do not alter BankAmerica's assessment
of the overall benefits of the planned merger'. He said both companies were
proceeding with regulatory filings needed to consummate the merger, which
was expected to go ahead in the next couple of months.
Bank of America, which said earlier this week it would increase the amount
of deposits to be divested upon completion of the merger from Dollars 4bn to
Dollars 7bn, has separately indicated it would create a 'bad bank'
consisting of problem assets of up to Dollars 4bn.
Bank of America said its fourth-quarter net income was Dollars 285m,
slightly below its Dollars 287m in the same period of 1990. Net earnings for
the whole of 1991 were Dollars 1.12bn, compared to Dollars 1.11bn of 1990.
Non-interest income rose by 18 per cent to Dollars 653m in the fourth
quarter, while net loan losses were Dollars 279m in the quarter, more than
double the Dollars 132m in the same quarter of 1990.
Total bad debt provisions for 1991 were Dollars 805m, compared with Dollars
905m in 1990.
By the close on Wall Street, Bank of America's share price had fallen
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , while Security Pacific's was Dollars 1/4
lower at Dollars 34 5/8.
