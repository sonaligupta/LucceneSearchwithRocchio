FT  02 JUL 92 / Miyazawa promises growth effort


   By Our Foreign Staff


MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, promised President George
Bush yesterday that he would lead an effort to strengthen economic growth in
Japan so as to draw in more US exports.
Mr Miyazawa, during his first official visit to Washington as premier, said
he expressed his determination to maintain sustained growth in the Japanese
economy. If current measures do not have sufficient effect, he said, 'I will
examine the situation and undertake every possible means, including
substantial additional fiscal measures.'
Mr Bush noted previous agreements giving US industries access to Japan's
Dollars 9bn computer market and its Dollars 27bn paper market. 'Still, I
feel we have more to do,' Mr Bush told Mr Miyazawa. 'I want to mention
continued interest in access to your markets for automobiles and auto
parts.'
Mr Doug Paal, a US National Security Council official, said a senior group
of US officials would report by August 1 on progress made by US car and car
parts industries on increasing exports to Japan, in line with agreements by
Mr Bush and Mr Miyazawa in January. He said the news might not be good
because Japan's economic recession has slowed demand for US products.
Mr Bush pleased his visitor by reaffirming US support for Tokyo's position
that it will give no large-scale aid to Russia before a Russo-Japanese
territorial dispute is resolved. Japan insists that Russia return a group of
Far Eastern islands it has occupied since 1945. US officials said, however,
the issue was not a factor in the Dollars 24bn international aid package
planned for former Soviet republics, mostly Russia.
