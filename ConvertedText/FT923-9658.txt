FT  04 AUG 92 / International Company News: RTC files Dollars 400m lawsuit
against Arthur Andersen

   NEW YORK


The Resolution Trust Corporation, the government agency handling the
clean-up of the US savings and loan (S&L) industry, has filed a Dollars 400m
lawsuit against Arthur Andersen.
It is alleging that negligent audit work by the big accountancy firm
contributed to the collapse of Benjamin Franklin Savings Association, a
large Houston-based savings and loan.
Andersen said that it would fight the case vigorously, and denied that it
was negligent during its auditing of Benjamin Franklin between 1984 and
1988.
The firm said the S&L's failure, which cost US taxpayers almost Dollars 1bn,
was related to the collapse in oil prices in 1986 and other economic forces
which were affecting the Texas region at the time.
The RTC, however, alleges that Andersen agreed to the use of accounting
devices by Benjamin Franklin's management that kept the company's
deteriorating financial condition from regulators.
While the case is pending, the RTC is reconsidering its relationship with
Andersen. The accountancy firm is one of the biggest contractors for the
agency.
The RTC has instructed its regional offices not to award new work to the
firm until the Benjamin Franklin case is resolved.
And Arthur Andersen has been asked to discuss its existing contractual
relationships (which are worth about Dollars 38m if completed) with the
government agency.
This is not the first time that Andersen has run into problems over its work
in the S&L industry during the 1980s.
In March, the firm agreed to pay a total of Dollars 30m to settle investor
claims from the collapse of the Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.
Other big accountancy firms and a number of legal firms have also faced
lawsuits over their role in the collapse of the savings and loan industry.
