FT  14 JUN 93 / Soldiers allow Haiti protest in support of Aristide

   PORT-AU-PRINCE


SOLDIERS allowed several thousand people in the western port of St Marc to
march over the weekend in protest at the 1991 ousting of President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
The march, an unusual act of tolerance, was one of several signs of growing
support for the reinstatement of Mr Aristide, Haiti's first democratically
elected president. Pro-Aristide and anti-army demonstrations have routinely
been crushed by soldiers since the coup.
In the capital, the presidents of Haiti's business associations met to draft
a declaration urging Aristide's reinstatement.
The draft called on parliament to recognise the exiled president's
legitimacy and to approve an Aristide-designated prime minister to head a
new government. In exchange, it asked Aristide to grant a general amnesty to
coup leaders and endorse all laws passed by parliament since he was ousted.
The army high command backs the proposal, according to a businessman close
to senior officers.
A consensus for Aristide's reinstatement is also building among legislators.
The National Assembly was due to convene today to begin working out a
solution.
The march was organised by Protestant churches in the city 60 miles to the
north of Port-au-Prince.
It has been the middle class, which supported the coup, that has grown
increasingly frustrated with the failure of military-backed governments to
find a way out of the crisis resulting from international economic sanctions
imposed after the coup.
