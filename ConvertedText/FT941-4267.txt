FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil postpones flotation
of US offshoot


   By NIKKI TAIT


Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas group, has postponed the proposed
stock-market flotation of its US operation, Bridge Oil (USA). It blamed
'current uncertainty' over crude oil prices.
The Sydney-based Bridge announced yesterday it intended to re-examine this
plan in the third quarter of 1994. It unveiled the flotation scheme in
December, and had hoped to finalise the transaction in the first quarter of
1994.
Bridge considered floating off the US oil and gas properties before, but was
thwarted by a previous fall in gas prices. Yesterday's announcement came as
it reported net profits of ADollars 27.6m (USDollars 19.8m) in the year to
end-December, compared with ADollars 39.4m last time. The figure was scored
after an abnormal surplus of ADollars 486,000, against ADollars 4.76m in
1992.
Pancontinental Mining, which was defeated in the bid battle for Aztec Mining
by Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's PosGold Investments, said yesterday it
had not served offer documents on the target earlier this week - and hence
did not have an offer for Aztec which was outstanding.
