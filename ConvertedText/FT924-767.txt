FT  22 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Faupel rises to Pounds 0.4m on back of
lower interest


   By PETER PEARSE


AN INTEREST charge reduced from Pounds 402,000 to Pounds 368,000 enabled
Faupel Trading Group, the USM-quoted textile importer, to lift pre-tax
profits from Pounds 611,000 to Pounds 639,000 in the six months to September
30.
A fall in interest payable also lay behind the pre-tax rise in the year to
end-March after operating profits slipped to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 2.04m).
This time they eased Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 1.01m on turnover ahead at
Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 12.1m). Mr Iain Brown, chief executive, said that lower
rates and the fact that Faupel's imports were financed on trust receipts on
dollar rates accounted for the interest fall.
Sales during the summer were 'generally patchy', according to Mr Michael
Molloy, chairman. Mr Brown added that the public's general lack of
confidence had led to an uncertain performance at retail level with a
'disappointing pre-Christmas run'.
When asked about any upturn at the year-end, Mr Brown had said he had seen
half a robin on the lawn, but that it flew away. He said yesterday that so
far it had not returned.
Household textiles, which accounted for about one-third of group turnover,
performed above expectations, though with 'tight margins' at the lower
priced end.
Within garments, which accounted for the other two-thirds, the contract
sales division, which supplied customers such as BhS, Harrods, Empire Stores
and GUS, had difficulties getting 'clients to call in stock on due time'.
Earnings were unchanged at 5.19p per share, as was the interim dividend at
1.85p.
