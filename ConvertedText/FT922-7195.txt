FT  20 MAY 92 / Horse feed supplements withdrawn from sale


   By CATHERINE MILTON


A DRUG company yesterday confirmed that it was withdrawing its vitamin
supplement products for competition horses because they might be poisonous.
Three horses are said to have died and several are seriously ill, according
to Colburn-Dawes Nutrition, a subsidiary of Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals
group. Those known to be affected are polo horses, hunters and eventers in
Suffolk and Hampshire.
The horses are alleged to have died after consuming excessive amounts of
selenium, one of the ingredients in the vitamin supplements that are given
regularly in feed.
The products are used by top horse studs around the world. Products have
been exported to Greece, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Iceland, the
Philipines and Taiwan.
The company said it was withdrawing all horse feed supplements made since
September and held by distributors and their customers in the UK. Overseas
customers were being warned but the company fears that most exports will
have been used already.
Tests by Ministry of Agriculture scientists have confirmed that the products
contain more selenium than they should. A spokesman from Medi Equus, a
Colburn-Dawes Nutrition distributor, said the tests disclosed 'huge
variations in the level of selenium and other potentially toxic minerals'.
